Last week, four anonymous students—three of which were falsely rumored to have been evicted from their campus housing—voiced concerns about AOD policy and its implementation on campus to the Quest. Among their concerns was allegedly inappropriate behavior on behalf of patrolling CSOs, behavior that, according to them, goes against the letter and spirit of Reed College’s AOD policy. According to these sources, CSOs have been targeting specific groups of students who they suspect to be in violation of the AOD policy without any evidence of misbehavior. As well, they cite instances of being unaware of AOD violations that have been administered to them, and overall displeasure with the policy and its enforcement.

These sources alleged that a student received an AOD violation for smoking marijuana in his room, although the student was studying in the library when the citation was given. They also claimed that CSOs have regularly patrolled around their rooms and apartments with the intention of accusing them of AOD violations, regardless of whether or not they are in possession of, or are using, alcohol or other drugs. Above all, these anonymous students were frustrated with the way CSOs have approached implementing the AOD policy and believed that many CSOs do not believe in the policy, despite giving out violations.

Perhaps their greatest frustration, however, came from the way they are learning about their AOD violations at all. According to the sources, the four of them have received multiple AOD violations without warning, two of them only learning about their violations after greater punitive action was signaled: letters of eviction that would be issued unless these students engaged in conversations with the administration.

In response to these allegations, Vice President and Dean of Student Services Mike Brody addressed the problem candidly. Brody emphasized that he would be “shocked” if the allegations of CSOs giving out AOD violations without evidence of misbehavior were true, but also said that he is “in the process” of investigating these allegations. Nevertheless, Brody did note once again that smoking in the dorms is against the housing contract, and must be investigated by CSOs if there is ample suspicion that it is taking place. Brody noted that a dorm room can be justifiably investigated if a CSO smells marijuana coming from a dorm room.

In regard to communication about giving out AOD violations, Brody acknowledged that the letters indicating that violations have been administered are coming out late, and that the administration is working out the logistics to make that process more efficient and effective. Brody commented that none of the letters have been intentionally administered late, and that the reason for the late AOD letters has much to do with the small number of administrators with whom he works to send these letters. Brody also noted that Reed makes a concerted effort to prioritize its finances, paying for high quality teachers before hiring large numbers of administrators, and that this reality can lead to these types of issues.

Gary Granger, Director of Community Safety, similarly responded that it is the responsibility of the CSOs to examine situations where there is evidence of AOD violations. Though not speaking in reference to a specific situation, he mentioned that CSOs have very clear instructions under the AOD implementation plan, which includes how to react when there are locked doors. The CSOs are instructed to knock twice and announce their presence, after which they are to note the location and move along.

Responding to the notion that CSOs do not believe in the implementation plan, Granger acknowledged the potential for cognitive dissonance from members of the community safety staff. However, he believes that this is a result of the positive relationship CSOs and Reed students have had in the past being compromised when discontent arises from students; even though CSOs are to do their job in accordance with the AOD policy. Granger acknowledged that a possible reason for this less-than-ideal relationship is because of the implemented walkthroughs that take place regularly in the Bragdon Hall and Old Dorm Block.  Granger noted that the walkthroughs occur simply because these are locations that have had the most AOD-related activity on campus.

In light of this, Granger has proposed a challenge for the Reed community: if no AOD violations occur in ODB for two straight weeks, he will suspend all regular walkthroughs in the dorm block. CSOs will still come to ODB for necessary check ups about unintentionally open doors and dorm lockouts, but, just like in KRRC, regular walkthroughs would be discontinued.

Though the four anonymous students hoped the administration would concede to similar agreements in the future, they were still adamant about their displeasure with the way the policy has changed the Reed community, and how they no longer feel comfortable with the administration and CSOs. Responding to this sense of displeasure, Brody remarked that he is not surprised that some students on campus have gotten upset this year, but feels strongly that the current uncomfortable relationship is “short lived.”
