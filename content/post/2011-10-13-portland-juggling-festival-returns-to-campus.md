Once a year, Reed campus becomes temporary home to a cohort of hippie-like jugglers running around displaying their proficiency for performance, friendliness, and getting really, _really_ drunk. This is what happened in the annual Portland Juggling Festival in Vollum Lecture Hall, Kaul Auditorium, the Sports Center, and the Commons porch on Friday Sep. 30th to Sunday Oct 2<sup>nd</sup>.

The Festival, started by Stuart Celarier, Reed&#8217;s very own juggling instructor, has helped make Portland—not to mention Reed—the hotspot for juggling for which it is so loved. Currently in its nineteenth year, the Festival caters to all sorts of juggling, from club juggling to disk juggling, even to acts less traditionally associated with juggling like unicycling. Over its time, the Festival has cultivated intense bonds within the community that are complemented by a willingness to teach and include. With such an attitude, and over forty workshops, the Portland Juggling Festival makes it impossible not to make new friends or find something interesting.

The first night&#8217;s Renegade Show, in Vollum, was an exuberant occurrence, with drunkenness, heckling, and nearly naked jugglers. Some members of the crowd seemed to take the craziness to heart and act on the impulse, including one who ran down to the stage to jam a dollar bill down a juggler’s briefs.

The following night was much calmer. The Juggling and Vaudeville Extravaganza show in Kaul had been advertised as family-friendly and, for the most part, it was. It did not suffer as much form catering to all ages as it could have –every performer was very skilled, and there was enough variety between acts to keep the show interesting. Some of the acts the crowd loved the most were the comedy variety acts which included a country-themed unicycling skit, a few duet juggling skits, and a comedic musical interlude by a trombonist.

Later that same night, the porch of Commons was home to the unofficial but no less impressive fireshow. Standouts among the dazzling performances included a duet fire-staff spinning set and a performance by Reed&#8217;s own Weapons of Mass Distraction.

The events of the final day of the festival in the Sports Center included more workshops, and awards ceremony, a raffle, and an auction. The auction&#8217;s proceeds benefited “Clowns Without Borders,” an organization that works to relieve the suffering of all persons, especially children who live in areas of crisis throughout the world, through laughter.

For those who didn&#8217;t attend the festival there is always next year, which will be a milestone for the festival as its twentieth anniversary. Until then, however, there are juggling classes every Wednesday from 7 to 9 PM in the lower gym of the Sports Center. Why not stop by and take a look?
