In a school where traditions go extinct in a week and the ways of last term are dismissed as &#8220;Olde Reed,&#8221; the continuing existence of Canyon Day is something akin to a miracle. For 99 years, the Reed Community has set aside at least one day – and since 2000 two &#8211; for a large work party aimed at cleaning up and improving the forested area at the heart of our campus.

The original college planners wrote of transforming the Reed Canyon into “an artful landscape of Tudor Gothic quadrangles and formal gardens,” and early Canyon Days reflected that vision. Photographs in the Reed Archives show students and faculty members scouring the canyon to remove dead wood and fallen leaves and building large bonfires with the debris. The goal of Canyon Day was to &#8220;tame&#8221; the area and convert it to a park-like setting.

On Canyon Day in 1915, students dredged an area at the west end of the pond to create a 10-foot-deep swimming hole. They later added a dock, a diving platform and separate bathhouses for men and women. (One of the bathhouses lived on as the bike co-op well into the 1990&#8217;s.)

As the college&#8217;s vision of the canyon evolved over time, the goal of Canyon Day changed too. With an increasing appreciation of the canyon&#8217;s natural beauty, the emphasis shifted from improvement to protection. Participants removed litter, built trails, and helped to clean up the area.

In recent years the primary goal of Canyon Day has been conservation. Students, staff and faculty now come together to celebrate the canyon and help remove the ‘silent invaders’ such as English Ivy, and Himalayan blackberry—This concentrated effort has eliminated the need to consider the use of herbicides and to better create a more habitable environment for our little woodland creatures. Generally after an amazing lunch provided by C.A.V.E and Ladies Pie Society we focus our efforts on reintroducing native plant species that will flourish into native plant communities, all of which support our native fauna.

Join your peers—Get involved!

Help bring back native plant habitat and enhance water quality at the headwaters of Crystal Springs Creek.
