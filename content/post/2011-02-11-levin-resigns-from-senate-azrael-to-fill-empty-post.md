Last Sunday, Zach Levin announced he was resigning from his position as a student senator. 

“This decision was not easy. I realized that this semester is going to require more of me than I initially expected and I do not have the time or the energy that I would want (and expect myself) to put into Senate. My two semesters on Senate were rewarding, frustrating, educational, emotional, and fun (sometimes all at once), and I am very grateful to the student body for electing me to serve them,” said Levin in an email.

David Azrael, the first runner-up in the last election cycle, will be appointed to fill the empty seat. Said Azrael in an email, “It is too bad that Zach Levin felt the need to step down but I will do my best to be the best senator I can be. Its a shame senate meetings cut into basketball practices but I am willing to make the sacrifice for the student body. I wish everyone a good second semester, especially my people at the fishbowl who believed I could become a senator despite the adversity.”

Levin expressed his confidence in Azreal and Senate as a whole: “I know David Azrael will do an excellent job and wish him the best of luck. He is joining a really great team that I have a lot of confidence in.”

Azrael will assume his official responsibilities over the weekend and continue to serve until the end of the current semester. His first senate meeting as a serving senator will be held Monday, February 14 at five pm in the Student Union.
