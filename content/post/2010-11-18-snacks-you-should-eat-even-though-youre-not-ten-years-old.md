**Danimals**

Pretty self-explanatory, this is animal-themed yogurt. This shit is boss. It is super creamy and not terrible.Plus, it gets points just for not being GoGurt. They come in these little plastic containers, which are awesome if you need a pretty big shot glass substitute. Bonus: your tequila will taste slightly less like liver damage.

**Gushers**

Okay, admit it. You loved Gushers. That’s because they were awesome. They couldn’t decide what texture to be, so they were all sorts of crazy things, all in one little bite size bit. Also, if the commercials are to be believed, they’d turn your head into some sort of anthropomorphized fruit monstrosity. PROTIP: If someone offers you just one gusher, all by itself, DO NOT EAT IT! It is probably full of LSD, and you will just think your head is a giant piece of fruit.

**Skippy Squeeze Stix**

Have you ever seen a product with more dual marketing appeal? One one hand, you have children. They are messy, hungry and want things to be as easy as possible. On the other hand, you have stoners. They too are messy, hungry, and want things to be as easy as possible. Skippy Squeeze Stix can solve all these problems. This is a snack you eat simply by applying pressure in a general area, and sticking it in your mouth. Most laboratory rats have to work harder for their meals. And it’s just peanut butter! Who doesn’t like peanut butter? Those whiners with the allergies, that’s who. Fuck them, I just want a tube of this tasty shit, sticky flow.
