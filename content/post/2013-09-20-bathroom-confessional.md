  These are my thoughts on women’s bathrooms.
</p>

There’s a trend towards all gender neutral bathrooms that I have a bit of a problem with. The reason is not that gender neutral bathrooms are dangerous or bad or scary; in fact, they’re necessary for all types of people who feel outside of any societally imposed gender or sex role. There should always be a gender neutral bathroom available at any school. That said, to eliminate female bathrooms as a space safe from men will have harmful repercussions.

Looking back at my emotional middle school and high school years&#8211; and, come to think of it, even college&#8211; the bathroom was the scene of many cries, fights, tender moments of friendship, and kindness (usually in the form of a donated tampon). It was where I fled to after being dumped during a lunch date on the football field. It was where I stuffed my underwear with toilet paper after getting my first period. It was where I ended a wonderful friendship with a decidedly “uncool” girl in middle school. It was the place where I cried, and a female teacher called out from the next stall, talking me through the tragedy of getting a subpar grade on a paper.

The reason that these things happened in the women’s bathroom was because, somehow, female bathrooms have become a space of shared camaraderie, a single room in a scary, mean, heartless middle school where girls can cry, put on makeup, gossip, fight, or do any other normal human thing, but free from the male gaze.

And the beauty of the female bathroom is that all women have to go there. It’s not a women’s center, or a female crisis line, or some other artificially constructed female space (not that there’s anything wrong with these places). It’s the one place where a fat, pimply, poorly dressed girl can joke about the unpleasantness of getting a period with the sophisticated professor in the next stall. It’s a place where an entire gaggle of girls will hug and offer cries of man-hating sympathy for the woman who has just been dumped. It’s where girls bleed, cry, pee, poop, puke, and exist together.

Now, the obvious rebuttal to my argument is that I’m asking only for female bathrooms and for gender neutral bathrooms. What about men? It’s because I don’t think men have the same bathroom culture, and I don’t think that they need it the way women do. Just google “the male gaze.” That’s all I have to say about that.

My argument is for safe spaces. Safe spaces for trans people, for queer people, and for women. Safe spaces for marginalized groups. And, despite what the new statistics say about the number of women in college, etc, women are still emotionally and sexually marginalized.

To put into place only gender neutral bathrooms ignores, as so many other things do, the necessity of having a space where women can be women, free from male observance and judgement. <b id="docs-internal-guid-60cbe1c8-523f-1206-a214-2510b43fceeb"></b>
