GCC 104

Come over to the International Student Services office (GCC 104, aka former Student Activities) at 7pm on Thursday, Sept 30 for a good time! We will have ingredients for you to make patbingsu and an opportunity for you to learn the dance moves to a popular Korean song (for those of you who know some K-pop, the song is “Nobody” by Wonder Girls). Take a study break to learn something new and to socialize with people you don’t find yourselves with everyday. This event is hosted by the ISS as part of the Country Spotlight program.

**“SEX-POSITIVITY FOR EVERYONE! INCLUDING THE MENS!”**
  
Tuesday, October 5th
  
7:00 PM &#8211; 8:30 PM
  
Vollum Lounge

What is masculinity or male advocacy as a movement, and how is it in dialogue with contemporary feminism? Can it be incorporated into feminism, or can the values of the sex-positive feminist community speak to its concerns? What does positive, productive talk about masculinity sound like? Feminist, pro-BDSM activist Clarisse Thorn will discuss the above questions in a short lecturette and then facilitate small discussions on kinky male sexuality, men in the pickup artist community, and men who buy sex.
