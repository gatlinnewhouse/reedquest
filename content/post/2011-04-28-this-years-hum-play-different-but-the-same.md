With Hum Play Friday fast approaching,  I spoke with director Jen Byers about what to expect. It has been a year of much change at Reed, with a dramatic shift in the Hum syllabus that replaced old favorites like Augustine and Apuleius with newcomers like Sallus and Cicero. Will Hum Play undergo similar changes?

The new script seeks a happy medium between old and new. “We have, of course, incorporated a lot of the new syllabus characters into the script, but have kept it sort of a middle ground to keep the upperclassmen in the loop,” said Byers.

Byers remained silent about the specifics of Hum Play, which is always supposed to be something of surprise, despite the fact that the typical tropes—nudity, debauchery, and puns­—remain the same. (It is rumored, though, that at Olde Reed the student protagonist was guided by Homer, not Dionysus and Apollo.)  “The general story stays the same every year,” said Byers. “’Oh, hi! I’m a Student, and I need to learn about Hum! Please take me to the Ancient World!’ ‘Okay, we will!’ Adventure and happy resolution!” When asked who was playing the leads, she responded, “The students and the guides to the ancient world, of course!” But she did give one hint about the content. “There is a solidly sized surprise involving dreadlocks, the golden donkey, and a double ended dildo.”

Sounds positively enchanting!

Byers played the hapless, frustrated main character at Hum Play last year, but this year she is directing. When asked about the best thing about directing, she simply responded, “Power.”

Hum Play is on Friday. The doors open at 7 and the show starts at 7:30. Line up early and remember your opaque bottles! If you don’t like the raucous atmosphere in Vollum Lecture Hall, you can always hang out in the overflow room, which will allow you to experience the glory that is the Hum Syllabus via the magic of live feed.
