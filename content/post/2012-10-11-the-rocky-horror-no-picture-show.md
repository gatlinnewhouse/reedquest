A chorus of “START THE FUCKING MOVIE” signaled the start of each showing of _The Rocky Horror No Picture Show_ last weekend. The production, which defined itself as “[a different kind of thesis][1],” ran from October 4-6 at the Black Box Theatre on campus. Thesis candidate Tristan Nieto directed the _Rocky Horror No Picture Show_ and thesis candidate Arion Russell designed and produced the show’s costumes. Every one of the _No Picture Show_’s four showings sold out, an occurrence that Russell said had never happened on any show that she had been a part of previously.

The production, a revision of the cult rituals that accompany _The_ _Rocky Horror Picture Show,_ began in much the same way as the typical _Rocky Horror_ stage show: actors dressed as the film’s principal characters lip-synched and mimed the events projected on the screen behind them. This action was short-lived, however, as the video malfunctioned after the first scene. As the play progressed, the actors became less dependent on the original film, eventually uttering lines out loud and reconstructing scenes. “Can we hold for real?” interrupted a scene of sexual coercion, calling for a revised version of the scene that properly demonstrated consent. One actor added, “Sexual aggression isn’t sexual liberation.”

The _No Picture Show_ also featured audience participation in the form of callbacks, sing-alongs, and collective dancing. Both Nieto and Russell agree that the final outcome exceeded their expectations. Nieto says that the run was far less of a hassle than he expected it to be. The thesis candidates were also pleased at the event’s turnout, though Nieto cited the small space as one cause of the sold-out performances.

Auditions for the play were held during the first week of September and rehearsals began one week later, leaving less than one month until opening night. Russell began producing the costumes with the aid of the costume shop staff during the first week of classes. She cites the project’s low budget as both an obstacle and an important contribution to the aesthetic that combined styles from the punk, goth, and grunge subcultures. Although the task of writing their theses remain for both Nieto and Russell, both candidates are glad to be finished with the performance. Russell, who came to Reed with the intent to pursue a costume design thesis, said that she “could not have picked a better project to get involved with.”
