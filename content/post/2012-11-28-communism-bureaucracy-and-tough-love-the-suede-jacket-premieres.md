The platonic form of sheep has been captured by Perry Nelson ’16 and placed in a black box. That Black Box is in the Reed College Theatre building, where _The Suede Jacket_ by Stanislav Stratiev debuted Wednesday. It plays Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 7:30 pm. The question of what it is to be a real sheep is examined at length in the Bulgarian play that was adapted by the director and thesis candidate Elizabeth Dinkova. She changed the end and beginning of the play so that “the American audiences could get both the tragedy and the comedy of living in a totalitarian state.”

When the protagonist, the urban non-shepherd Antonov (Spenser Silbey ’15), struggles to get excessive fur removed from his poorly made suede jacket, he must take it to a man who shears sheep. In a shining instance of bureaucratic incompetence, the jacket therefore receives official classification as a sheep, a classification that refuses to relent.

The play falls under the genre of Socialist Theatre of the Absurd, a fun little “contradiction in terms” as Dinkova puts it—the doctrine of Socialist Realism doesn’t mesh with the idea that the world is absurd. The bright-future outlook of socialist realism and its characteristic emancipation of the working class are undermined by the wild goose chase on which  the communist bureaucracy sends the hero of the tale. His personal morality does nothing to help his cause. Unraveling which philosophy prevails at any given moment is a puzzle best left to the audience. As Silbey put it, “I don’t get it.” Nothing can be dismissed as totally absurd, nor can it be taken as symbolic.

The bodies of the actors alternate between characterized agent and tool of the system, acting out righteous monologues like robots of the hammer and sickle. The final note from the director as the dress rehearsal began recommended actors to be “shaking and tearing yourself out of the mechanical.”  There is certainly a blatant divide between the characters who try to use the system, and those who accept it.  A third perspective was added by Dinkova, a disembodied surprise which drives the play to its finish.
