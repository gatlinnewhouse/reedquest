Earlier this year, Bicycling Magazine named Minneapolis the bike-friendliest city in America, ending Portland’s reign as the city best suited for two-wheeled transportation. The blogosphere went mad as bike commuters decried the fall of their beloved city to the number two spot.

Amid the collective chagrin of Portland’s biking community, however, Reed’s Bike Co-op continues to thrive.

Nestled in the basement on the west end of ODB, the Co-op is staffed by a group of student mechanics and serves the Reed community by providing bike repairs, cycling maps of Portland, and chain lube among other things.

Senior Ross Young, one of Bike Co-op’s two signators (the other being Alex Ragus), stresses that the Bike Co-op is more than just a free bike shop for Reedies, though: “While repairing bikes and getting people back on the road is a huge part of what we do,” he says, “I think the most valuable role the Co-op has is sharing skills and experience. I think we really lose something when users and mechanics treat the Co-op as a free bike shop rather than as a space to learn and interact.”

The mechanics at the Co-op share this dedication to teaching rather than doing. Sophomore April Kaplowitz said, “I always try to teach the person how to fix their bike, or at least explain what I’m doing if it’s really complicated, instead of just doing it for them.”

The importance of teaching Reedies how to fix their bikes was explained by both Young and Kaplowitz with one word: “empowerment.” Both say that the ability to fix one’s own bike is liberating, and being able to pass that knowledge on to others is rewarding. “It is a very empowering experience for many people to not only get their bike fixed, but to learn how to pick up a wrench and do it themselves. Facilitating that process is, for me, the most rewarding part of volunteering at the Co-op. A friend told me the other day that she taught another person how to change a flat tire after learning from me at the Co-op. Stories like that are why I love working at the Co-op and why it’s such a great space to have at Reed,” said Young.

Kaplowitz echoed Young’s sentiments. “As a Bike Co-op mechanic, I think it’s incredibly important to teach folks how to fix things rather than do it all myself, because it’s incredibly empowering to know how a bicycle works. On a bike, it’s easy to get stranded anywhere, and personally, knowing that I can get myself out of almost any minor scrape makes riding my bike that much more fun and enjoyable. One time, in Austin, I was biking home and my quick-release wheel came out of alignment. Two big strong men rushed to help me—and I’m not the type to just tell someone to go away—but the whole time I was thinking that I would be infinitely better off without all of these extra hands getting in the way. It felt so good knowing exactly how to help myself,” she said.

The Bike Co-op’s dedication to teaching extends past having mechanics show Reedies how to fix their bikes. Kaplowitz explains that a shared passion for bikes creates a sense of community for Co-op mechanics.

“Although in the past, mechanics rarely interacted with each other outside of the occasionals shared shift, there was a strong sense of community between us. I think this was because of passion for all things bike-related. It’s easy to have a great conversation with someone who is as in love with something as I am.

“One of my favorite Bike Co-op memories from last semester is from when I was sharing a particularly slow shift with Nick Pittman,” she recalls. “There were two other mechanics and someone from the Backpack Co-op around. Someone suggested we play Boggle. We did and had an amazing time. I had hardly even spoken to those other mechanics before, but it didn’t matter. Playing Boggle on that rainy day and sharing our passion for bikes made for a great time.”

This year, Young hopes to strengthen the Bike Co-op by pairing experienced mechanics with newer ones in order to further promote teaching and community building. “I think the Bike Co-op has great potential to build a community around mechanics, Co-op users, and really all bicyclists in the Reed community,” he says. “Pairing up new volunteers with more experienced mechanics and creating an inclusive and supportive atmosphere for Co-op users are key ways to foster this.”

The Bike Co-op is open for repairs, conversation, and all things bike from five to seven pm on weeknights and one to three pm on weekends.
  
Young welcomes all in the community to stop by: “Come on in. There’s no prior knowledge required and it’s free.”
