This year’s Vollum Award winner, Kip Thorne, delivered a lecture on black holes, gravitational waves, wormholes, and other weird stuff. At the end of the talk, he introduced the black hole firewall paradox. My goal is to describe the paradox and why it matters.

Half of the paradox depends on the first exact solution to the Einstein equations. The solution was discovered in 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild who found the solution for space-time outside a spherical mass. What he found was that if you made the mass sufficiently small, there existed a surface of no return. The surface is called the event horizon because you can’t see events that take place inside it. We call things that have event horizons black holes. An important consequence of his solution is that if you were to pass an event horizon, you wouldn’t notice it. It’s not like hitting a wall, it’s just traveling to another part of space.

The other half of the paradox depends on several features of quantum mechanics. The first piece we need, entanglement, was illuminated in 1935 when Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen claimed (incorrectly) to have shown quantum mechanics was incomplete. Entanglement is a correlation between the properties of particles. A simple entangled system is a pair of particles that come from a non-rotating source. Because it’s non-rotating, we know that the particles must be rotating in opposite directions by conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, if we measure one particle to be spinning clockwise, we know that the other particle is spinning counter clockwise. Because we know the correlation, knowing about one particle tells us about the other.

The next part of the paradox comes from quantum field theory (QFT), which was formulated in the fifties by Julian Schwinger and Paul Dirac, among others. QFT describes nature at its smallest scales. The result of QFT relevant to us is that particle pairs are continuously coming into existence and recombining into nothingness. These are called virtual particles because we can’t see them, but we know they exist because we can see their effects. The most famous example is the Casimir force.

Then, in 1974, Stephen Hawking wondered what happened to virtual particles near a black hole’s event horizon.  He calculated that it’s possible for a pair of virtual particles to come into existence, for one of them to fall into the black hole, and for the other to escape. Because the second particle didn’t annihilate, it becomes a real particle. We interpret this as the black hole emitting radiation.

The final two pieces of the paradox, conservation of information and the monogamy of entanglement, both proven in 2000, come from quantum information theory (QIT). QIT is about the information needed to describe a system. Conservation of information requires that the radiation coming from a black hole must carry information about what made the black hole. This is accomplished by the radiation and the black hole being entangled. Also, for technical reasons I don’t understand, the radiation recently leaving the black hole must be entangled with radiation that left a long time ago. The monogamy of quantum entanglement forbids this kind of entanglement, implying conservation of information is impossible.

When physicists noticed this problem in 2012, they calculated what QFT and QIT say happens right at the event horizon. In July 2012, the AMPS collaboration announced they found a “kink” in the quantum fields that destroys everything falling into the black hole. This kink prevents the promiscuous entanglement and is called a firewall.

The firewall contradicts Schwarzschild’s conclusion that nothing _really_ interesting happens at the event horizon. This forces us to conclude that one of the assumptions in the prior reasoning is wrong or that the reasoning is wrong in some subtle way.  Because there’s no evidence suggesting which assumption is wrong, and an error in reasoning isn’t obvious, the theoretical community is in chaos. The paradox fascinates physicists because it involves general relativity and quantum mechanics. A theory of how general relativity and quantum mechanics get along is THE HOLY GRAIL of modern theoretical physics and it appears a paradox one hundred years in the making may finally shed some light on the deepest questions physicists ask.
