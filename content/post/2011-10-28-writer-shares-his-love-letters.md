On Wednesday Oct. 13th, in the latest installment of the Creative Writing department’s Visiting Writers program, Stanford Creative Writing Professor and Louisiana native Skip Horack gave a thoroughly captivating reading. In adulation, one audience member said that “he had the perfect reading voice. I closed my eyes and thought, ‘uh, where am I?’ And then I opened them and saw: ‘whoa, I’m in Elliot.’”

Horack admits that the lush southern landscape of his childhood has seeped irrevocably into his writing. Before reading excerpts from his two published books, Horack treated the audience to a bit of his own literary philosophy. “I think it’s something Emily Dickinson said that all writers have something called their flood section,” he told us. “I always try to find my flood section, and I guess pretty much everything I write is about nature.”

The reading proceeded with a story from the story collection _Southern Cross_ (2009), excerpts from the prologue and body of his novel, _Eden Hunter_ (2010), and finally, a scene from a new novel, not yet published.  After describing his childhood landscape, Horack prefaced the story “Blue Bonnet Swamp” as his “his love letter to that part of the world, to the swamps and bayous of that area.” The leap he made next into his novel however was not as smooth and required some explaining.

_Eden Hunter_, which received New York Times Editors’ Choice and Hudson Booksellers Top 10 Books of the Year, relates the tale of a young, West African pigmy, enslaved in the American South, who escapes to the wilderness of Spanish Florida and finally reaches a British fort run by escaped slaves. Horack described a conversation that he shared with Creative Writing professor Peter Rock on a party bus in which Rock asked what Horack was working on. Horack sheepishly responded that his “book is about a pygmy”, and Rock looked at him as if he were crazy.

The project might seem unusual, but Horack explained that he chose it because of what it demanded, writing about “the type of things I’d written love letters to, but approaching them as an outsider.” This same theme of innovation around tradition appeared in the preview of his upcoming novel as the narrator, Roy, recounted the events on the oil rig in Grand Isle, Louisiana on the fateful day that he loses his pinky finger.

In all of his stories, certain components, such as the lawyer narrator of “Blue Bonnet Swamp,” hide a piece of Horack’s own past: “before I was ever interested in writing, I was interested in law,” he said after the reading. “Then I just started waking up a little earlier in the morning to write. People write books when they’re at war. I guess what I’m trying to say is that there are no excuses.”
