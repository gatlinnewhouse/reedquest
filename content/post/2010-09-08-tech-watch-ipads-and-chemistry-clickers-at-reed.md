Fall is always an exciting season – it’s a fresh new start. You know it’s not really fall unless something changes – new haircut, new lifestyle, new whatever. We look to fall to reinvent ourselves every year. Here at Reed, we’ve got lots of new stuff – new students, new office locations, new staff and administration, and – awesome! – brand spankin’ new technology. And it comes in two forms: the (now infamous) “Chem Clicker” and a new iPad trial program run by the Computer Store.

The official term for the technology being integrated into Chemistry 101, 102, and 201 is the “Classroom Response System,” though the colloquial term widely used is simply “clickers.”

Clickers, which are purchasable through the Reed College Bookstore for $20, are small electronic devices equipped with a keypad and radio transmitter. Pressing a key on the clicker generates a radio signal that can be received by the instructor’s computer.

Instructors are thus able to pose a question to the entire class, collect answers from all students, and then share the class’s overall performance with the students.

“We are at the very beginning of our experiment [with clicker technology],” says Professor Alan Shusterman, who used clickers with five students in an advanced chemistry class last spring before using it this fall in three Chemistry 201 classes.

Clickers are being integrated into the classroom in response to an ever-increasing number of students registering for particular courses. With enrollment between 70 and 80 students per section, “we turned to clickers as a way to make the class more interactive despite that large size,” says Professor Julie Fry, an instructor for Chemistry 101/102. “We find that with a large lecture section, when we pose questions verbally, the same small number of students will always answer. We see clickers as a resolution to this: [they] encourage the students to think about and answer questions throughout the lecture.”

The decision to start using clickers was thoroughly researched and discussed in depth before this fall.

The primary critique of said technology is that it decreases personal interaction between students and instructors, but the Reed Chemistry Department believes otherwise: in fact, clickers are being introduced to try and personalize the experience despite massive class size. “We read and consulted colleagues at other institutions about the use of clickers in the curriculum this past summer before introducing them at Reed, and found overwhelming evidence that students learn and retain information better when they are actively engaged in the lecture instead of listening to a professor ‘broadcast,’” says Professor Maggie Geselbrecht, Department Chair and instructor of Chemistry 101. “With the clickers, we hope to provide that student-centered learning experience for everyone.”

The benefits of clicker use have already begun to show. “I have already seen that the responses students give to a clicker question can be used to drive a class-wide discussion between me and my students, or to drive discussions between small groups of students,” says Shusterman, pointing out that “peer-learning is known to be an incredibly effective teaching method and clickers are a good way to stimulate that.”

As for the speculation that clickers were introduced to provide a way of taking attendance, Shusterman says that “students already have a clear incentive to attend class, but I almost never see 100% attendance. If a student thinks clickers provide an additional and adequate incentive to attend class, then attendance might rise. That said, clickers are just one more factor to consider.”

Clickers are also beneficial to instructors. “If a concept has not come across clearly, we immediately know and can tailor our lecture material to address any misconceptions [right away],” says Fry.

Shusterman seconds this statement. “Clicker feedback is incredibly useful for me as a teacher,” he explains, “A good clicker question tells me immediately whether or not I have lost my students. And, if I have lost some number of them, their responses tell me what kind of confusion I may have generated.”

In the less-academically related world, the Reed College Computer Store launched a “Try-to-Buy” iPad program this August.

The trial program offers students and faculty the opportunity to try out Apple’s latest snazzy new product for a week and, if they like it, purchase the trial iPad at a 10% discount or buy a new one for the regular price ($499 &#8211; $829, plus additional monthly charges for 3G network access).

“Many schools participate in pilot programs like this – Reed is generally more cautious,” says Rabeca Reese of Reed’s Computer Store.

“Apps still need to come along,” said Reese, adding that Reed is excited to see what Apple will reveal in their November update for the iPad. Two features that would most improve the efficiency and usefulness of the tablet in the academic world would be multitasking and printing, options that the iPad currently does not support.

The Computer Store has sold approximately 42-43 iPads since the initiation of the Try-to-Buy program. Currently, more faculty and staff have purchased iPads, but statistics show a steady pattern that should have numbers about even between the groups in the near future.

The program has stayed full since its start, lending out two iPads a week (both 16GB WiFi versions), and the Computer Store has seen a 50% purchase rate among participating customers.

“We really are just giving the iPad to the Reed community and saying, ‘What do you think of this?’” says Reese. “We want to know if it’s going to really work, or if it’s just another ‘thing to have.’”

This is the Computer Store’s first time attempting a Try-to-Buy program, which is why they’re “starting out small,” says Reese. “We’re still figuring out the wrinkles.”

So why the iPad? “It’s a new technology, offering more than just an eReader, and we knew there would be an interest.” And, like most things at Reed, it’s about curiosity.

“We wanted to find an affordable way for people to take a look at this new, fascinating technology in real life,” says Reese. “The iPad costs a big chunk of change!”

As time progresses, of course, the iPad and clickers will certainly see an increase in features, usefulness, style, and affordability, especially in the case of the iPad.

“As far as instructional technology goes, I am sure that we will see lots of changes in coming decades,” says Shusterman. “It is getting easier and easier to do things with computers, and I think we’ll see more moves towards human-friendly input devices and software that personalizes instruction so that you study at your pace and receive useful feedback.”
