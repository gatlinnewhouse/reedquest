The role of technology at Reed – as it is at any institution steeped in tradition and expectation – is often approached tenuously. This year, a number of Reed faculty and students are doing a significant portion of their academic work on the Apple iPad – the new tablet product from Apple that the company lauds can “do things no tablet PC, netbook, or e-reader can”. Though the iPad is not necessarily the product to change everything, the initial reactions to its academic use have been incredibly positive, and may indicate a trend towards greater use with technology in Reed’s future.

“The CPC approved a pilot program for twenty-one teachers to get iPads,” said Daniel Lidral-Porter ’11, member of the Computing Policy Committee. “Our supposition is that the desktop, which used to be the dominant form, was replaced by the laptop, and there is a possibility for that change to occur again towards iPads…[and the iPad] is something we want to investigate for it’s potential in the classroom and for teachers”.

The twenty-one teachers who have received the iPads are from all five academic divisions at Reed and use the product in a variety of ways. Jay Dickson, a Professor of English and Humanities, acknowledges that he is “a bit of a Luddite, by nature”, but after seeing fellow professors use the iPad for reading and note taking, has decided to try the product out.

“I applied for an iPad through the CTO office…[and] I will be reading PDFs and e-books for Hum 110 this semester…and hope to set it up so I can comment on student papers for the Spring English Junior seminar I’m teaching.”

Professor Alex Montgomery-Amo from the Political Science department used the Kindle DX with his students in his Nuclear Policy class last year as part of a nation-wide evaluation of the Amazon e-reader. Professor Montgomery-Amo’s experience with the iPad this year has been much more positive:

“The iPad, unlike the Kindle, is at least as good as paper. The Kindle was not as interactive as paper because it was so difficult to make annotations or highlight passages. Students did not actively absorb from the reading [and as a result] they read the Kindle as if it were a novel… With the iPad annotation tools are sufficiently fast and sufficiently intuitive that students are using the annotation tools extensively during the class.”

Montgomery-Amo’s assessment of the Kindle DX was similar to the sentiment felt around the country. The iPad has had much more positive reception: the students in the Nuclear Policy class have been consistently bringing all their readings to class on the lightweight iPad, whereas in in previous years students would be reluctant to either bring their computers or print out the PDFs.

The iAnnotate application allows for faster and effective note taking and, even more practically, the class community has been maintained through iPad use.

“If you have students bring in laptops you end up seeing this great wall around you with all the screens and because the iPads sit flat or mostly flat on the tables it means that the students are more interactive and don’t hide behind their computers.”

For Montgomery-Amo and his students the iPad has been a great success, and future opportunities for iPad use at Reed may very well mirror what the upper level Political Science course is doing. This is not the only possibility for the iPad, though, and teachers in other departments have different and exciting ideas for what they want to do with the product as well.

Professor Jim Fix of the Mathematics Department and Professor Akihiko Miyoshi of the Art Department hope to collaborate this year to design a program that will support processing on the iPad for beginning digital media and computation students. Both professors hope that if by February the iPad proves to be an effective platform for programming they could rearrange their courses to use the iPad as a teaching tool.

Marty Ringle, Chief Technology Officer of the Computing and Information Services Department at Reed plans to receive reports from all twenty-one teachers who have been given iPads by February.

His department will then write a report to present to the Reed community on whether tablet use should be more heavily integrated into Reed academics. Lidral-Porter and the rest of the CPC have been prepared for those reports since the start of the semester:

“By the end of February [each Professor] is supposed to submit a two page report about the effectiveness [of the iPad], and how they felt the iPad was useful personally and how they felt it was useful in the classroom. We [the CPC] will be evaluating those reports and assessing whether or not we want to expand the iPad program.”

Positive reviews will mean teachers will be given the opportunity to ask for iPads from the CPC instead of computers. Enough popularity in this may lead to further integration of the iPad at Reed, with the possibility of more classes, like the Nuclear Policy class, using iPads as well. This latter change would almost certainly mean substantial changes to all parts of Reed life – it’s possible that subsidization of tablet products would be included in future Reed financial aid packages. Lidral-Porter hopes that one day iPads (or other tablet products) can be taken out on reserve from the library. Montgomery-Amo thinks that, though the iPad is certainly not a perfect product, it is “the first device that I’ve seen that could provide for a good classroom and learning experience” and that it’s future use in a classroom is very realistic. Marty Ringle perhaps has the most ambitious ideas about a tablet’s ability to affect the classroom. While we spoke, he spoke about the possibilities of plant biology classes taking iPads out into the canyon and inserting information about plants into a database while out in the field. And he spoke with candid assurance that there is really no way to know what might happen with the iPad, or any other tablet device, at Reed in the future.
