_The Statement of Diversity was originally drafted by a volunteer group of students in the spring of 2009. Two weeks ago the Reed College Board of Trustees approved it, codifying it as comunity policy. It represents the first time in the college’s ninty-nine years of existance that an overarching policy has expressed an explicit commitment to the diversity._

Reed College is a community dedicated to serious and open intellectual inquiry, one in which students, faculty, and staff can fully participate, regardless of ethnicity, race, religion, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, socio-economic status, or disabilities.  Reed embraces the inherent value of diversity. It is committed to attracting the best and brightest from every group, including those who have historically experienced discrimination and prejudice, for it recognizes that dialogue between people with different perspectives, values, and backgrounds enhances the possibilities for serious intellectual inquiry.  The College is also committed to creating an environment that respects the dignity and civil rights of all persons, particularly those from groups that have experienced discrimination and persecution, for it recognizes that intolerance and prejudice diminish those possibilities.

Reed is dedicated to the honor principle, which expects that each of us actively maintains an open mind and generous heart in order to create a community that welcomes and supports all of its members. When the honor principle is realized, every member of the community is respected, and can speak, work, teach, and learn free from intolerance or harassment.

Every member of the Reed community benefits from the talents and experiences of our peers, from the mutual respect we exercise, and from the responsibilities we take for our actions. Each of us deserves equal opportunity to teach, to learn, and to grow.
