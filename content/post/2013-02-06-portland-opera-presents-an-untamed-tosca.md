_Tosca_ plays at Keller Auditorium on Saturday, February 9<sup>th</sup> at 7:30 pm. Student rush tickets are available 1 hour before the show for $10 with ID.

When _Tosca_ begins, the audience joins an adventure. The curtain goes up without an overture and a cathedral towers over an escaped convict, the former consul of Rome. A painter promises to help him escape Scarpia, the hypocrite chief of police who “plays priest and executioner.” Suddenly Floria Tosca, the diva, descends onto the scene singing of love and jealousy.

It proceeds about how you’d expect.

But this passionate opera has some surprises in store. Where some opera masks its excessive emotional manipulation in comedy or moralizing, _Tosca_ plays it straight. The diva’s manic verses that switch from desperation to adoration in a split second seem petty and ridiculous in the imposing cathedral where the starving prisoner hides in the chapel and the Virgin Mary looks on at her flirtations. In the second act, when she hears her lover’s (literally) tortured screams, it is clear that all of the emotion was genuine. She murders Scarpia who has attempted to trade her honor for the life of the painter, and in that moment all of her passion is validated. When he lies dead on the floor, she puts a cross on his chest in a moment of religious sentiment. She _is_ her passion and her love is all consuming. It kills everyone in the opera. It’s a force to be reckoned with.

The evil Scarpia is as near as one gets to the platonic form of villain in Opera. His evil intentions are not softened by idiocy or comic relief. He never holds back. He refuses to be beaten and he takes everything that he wants. He relishes Tosca’s hatred and it makes him desire her all the more as he orders the continued torture of her lover. He is truly heinous.

_Tosca_ relies heavily on the suspension of disbelief. The characters are far too passionate, far too sincere, and far too cruel. But if they are approached with the same total abandon as they present themselves with, the opera works beautifully.

It is easy to be caught up in the plot with Tosca. The music is less prominent as this was part of a more realistic movement in opera. The bells will sound just like Rome, be assured. Kara Shay Thomson as Tosca rose to the challenge of an opera diva playing an opera diva very mathematically, namely by singing with the force of two divas. The set was mostly brown and dim, which undersold the beauty of the construction. It was not wasted, however. With _Tosca_, in the story and singing and staging, the illusion is complete.
