Perhaps the most alarming statistic about the armed robbery that took place on campus on Wednesday, November 16 is the fact that the perpetrators hung out on campus for several hours beforehand, stopped by the library, and were noticed by at least four or five Reedies. These Reedies informed the CSOs after the robbery that they thought that they had seen the possible perpetrators hanging around campus, and reported that they had made them feel uncomfortable. One of them tried to bum a cigarette from a student.

The three perpetrators proceeded north across campus, where they robbed three students in the Naito/Sullivan Breezway at gunpoint. They took a laptop, two cell phones, a wallet, and a hookah. Community Safety Director Gary Granger said, “There was no way to know if they came looking for an armed robbery or if it was a crime of opportunity.” Granger noted that the fact that they hung around campus for a while would seem to indicate that it was a crime of opportunity, but the fact that one of them had a gun in their sleeve might indicate otherwise.

The individuals were males, wore dark grey hoodies, blue jeans, and had blue bandanas  over their faces, and dark hair. They had a darker complexion and it was noted that they were possibly middle eastern or Hispanic, but Granger noted that given the bandana, identifying the race of the perpetrators is difficult. The case is being turned over to the police, and Community Safety is passing on supplemental reports they have acquired. Granger said that catching the perpetrators is unlikely, unless they happen to be caught in an unrelated crime, are caught with the stolen Macbook, or make a call with one of the stolen phones.

Granger was unable to judge whether this robbery was an isolated act or part of a ring of thefts. He noted that the thefts of Macintosh computers last year was done by a ring of thieves who committing burglaries throughout Portland so that they could buy drugs. Granger said, “Regardless of whether it was an isolated act, in a situation like this you need to respond as if it could happen again.”

So what happens now?

**Police will be investigating the robbery, although they (probably) won&#8217;t be on campus and they (definitely) won&#8217;t be patrolling campus.**

****Despite ambiguous wording in the Community Safety Bulletin that implied police officers might be on campus, they won&#8217;t be coming unless called.

**CSOs will be on their guard_._** 

Reed&#8217;s Community Safety Officers often approach people to ask them for their Reed ID and why they are on campus if they aren&#8217;t a Reed student. Granger noted that he would be talking to CSOs to ensure that they felt as safe as possible in the encounters. Granger noted that these encounters are always “potentially dangerous” because they put the CSOs in a vulnerable position and would be attempting to educate CSOs about the people “too dangerous to talk to.” In addition, CSOs are reporting propped doors and open windows, and turning this information over to Resident Directors.

**The GCCs will remain only accessible by swipe cards at night.** 

The locking of the GCCs at night, to be accessible only by card swipe, will be going on indefinitely. Granger said, “Some security measures are an inconvenience for people, and we don&#8217;t think this is a huge inconvenience.” Granger did note that he was open to conversation about leaving the GCCs open at night.

**Reedies have been &#8211; and should continue to &#8211; call for CSO checks on sketchy people.** 

More Reedies have been calling to report people who they think are suspicious. Granger had advice on finding out who was suspicious, “Reedies on campus are usually doing something, whether they&#8217;re hanging out with friends or are on their computers. If you see people walking around who don&#8217;t look like they have a reason for being here, you should call Community
