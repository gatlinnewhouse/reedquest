**Smoking Affects Us All**

The subject of smoking on campus in closed rooms can’t be a new subject, as I observed nonchalant smoking and flipping the live butts to the floor in the pool hall during the recent&#8217;s parent weekend at Reed. Then, sure enough, speaking with current students, I found that smoking there is common.

Understanding Reed and its Honor Principle, I am trying to understand how smoking in closed space with non-smokers jives. Notwithstanding the state law on smoking in the workplace, I am not calling for tougher enforcement or even reporting the smokers to the Judicial Board. Rather, I would like to have a discourse about the pros and cons of smoking in closed spaces with non-smokers present.

I am interested in the thinking of those that smoke like this and those that don’t smoke. Surely, there must be a personal rationale that it&#8217;s okay to have your smoke fumes enter the lungs of non-smokers, when there is a choice to not smoke. I am thinking that the smoker must be knowledgeable that second-hand smoke has harmful health effects and is often very offensive to the non-smoker. So, if the smoker is knowledgeable and smokes anyway, then either he/she doesn’t care about others, or contests that second-hand smoke is unhealthy (akin to denying that global warming exists), or believes that there are far more harmful substances in the air than tobacco smoke, or some other rationale. The point here is that smoking in a closed space DOES HAVE an effect on the non-smokers present. It is not a neutral act.

Even though I am a physician in public health, I don’t condemn people who smoke as I understand that they are getting something positive out of it and it is their choice to make. The problem with smoking comes from the physical fact that the smoke permeates the local atmosphere.

And what about the thinking of the non-smokers who are present in the closed space with smokers? Is it okay to simply avoid places like the pool hall where this happens or to breathe it in and keep quiet about it?

So let’s have it smokers, what is your rationale for thinking that it okay to smoke in closed places with non-smokers present?

**Worst. Argument. Ever.**

So I read, “[Poplin: Secularism an Obstacle in the Search for Truth][1],” and seriously, it’s just bad. Mary Poppins Poplin would do well to subject her ideas to secular thought just to root out the completely obvious, and laughable, problems with her argument.

Let’s take a look at the first quote. “Radical secularism in our modern western culture is bankrupting the university.” That is an interesting statement. Because in modern Pakistan, radical Islamists shot a 14 year old girl for the radical idea that she deserves an education. And right here in modern Western Portland Oregon we have: Western Seminary, Warner Pacific College, University of Portland, Multnomah University, Linfield College, George Fox University, and Concordia. All universities you can attend where your magical thinking will never be questioned. This “plague taking over all the universities” can really be summed up as Reed College and Reed doesn’t kick you out for not being an Atheist or Agnostic. It is simply more acceptable to question those beliefs without being kicked out of school or marginalized. Try saying “God is Dead” at Concordia and see how far that gets you. Good luck with that.

Also, being an atheist or agnostic does not make you ignorant of “what the majority of the world believes,” it simply means you don’t believe it. Huge difference. On close reading it appears that Poplin is only interested in the “truth” offered by “Judeo-Christian” traditions anyway. Hardly representative of what the entire world believes. If we are to list the top five religions of the world, it breaks down like this; Christianity at 2.1 billion, Islam at 1.6 billion, Non-religious at 1.1 billion, Hinduism at 1.1 billion and Buddhism at around 376 million. That means if we are really looking at what the majority of the world believes we have to take into account non-belief, as we are in the top 5 religions. Go Team!

And finally the most ridiculous argument of all, the reason we have to take religion (and what she really means, Christianity) seriously is because of Mother Teresa. Her argument is: Mother Teresa, therefore Christianity good. Of course the obvious counter point is: Fred Phelps, therefore religion bad. The reality is the label of Christianity has absolutely no determination on how a person acts morally in the world. For every good Christian who kisses babies and likes rainbows, there is a Christian that eats kittens and hates rainbows.

The reality is that the world is still very religious and our universities need to be institutions that allow students to question the status quo, which is currently religious. There is no end to the list of institutions that won’t even allow you to participate if you question their religious underpinning. I, for one, feel fortunate to work at an institution that allows students genuine and unfettered discourse regardless of their beliefs. That is not an obstacle for the search for truth, quite the contrary, it is a requisite.
