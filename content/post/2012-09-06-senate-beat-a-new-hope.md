There is a shadowy body that regulates your Student Body funds, appointments, and general goings-on. What is this mysterious group? It&#8217;s the Reed College Student Body Senate. Coverage of their first meeting this year can be found in approximately exactly five paragraphs.

But first, background: Senate is independent of the administration and is composed by students who are elected every semester to yearly terms (not all senators are up for election every time). Every senator is on either Finance or Appointments Committee, which eponymously handle funding for student groups and appointments to student body positions like Judicial Board and Student Union manager. They also deal with other student body political issues and act as the student body&#8217;s liaisons to the administration.

_Senate Beat_ is your source for coverage of Senate&#8217;s aspirations, frustrations, and machinations. It aims to make the sometimes-confusing affairs of Senate clear to the student body. Though it&#8217;ll be written (as always) in a traditional loose, informal style, _Senate Beat_ is not an opinion column; it is journalistic coverage of what happens at each meeting, how it happens, and why.

After this year&#8217;s first meeting (finally getting there in just a couple paragraphs), former senator Sarah Carlisle approached the two _Quest_ editors in attendance and offered to write _Senate Beat._ The column has traditionally been written by former senators, whose experience with the workings of Senate is better than that of anyone else on campus.

Nonetheless, the current _Quest_ board has chosen to have the column written by a reporter with journalistic experience. Though the particular reporter may also be an editor, this doesn&#8217;t mean an editorialist is writing _Senate Beat_, it means a reporter is writing it, who will report. Reportorially. _Factually_. Any parties with relevant opinions or background information should therefore contact _Senate Beat_ by email or in person (the one with the mysterious eyes and the raven hair and the pen and paper sitting near the front at Senate meetings) so _Senate Beat_ can report said relevant opinions and facts.

Now, on to the meeting. The first meeting of the year was an open forum for students and others to recommend ideas to Senate. “It doesn&#8217;t matter how outlandish. Rooster sculptures are acceptable,” said Senator John “Jislin” Iselin in the quote of the week.

Defenders of the Universe, the enigmatic student group responsible for contraptions like the couch see-saw and giant skee-ball apparatus seen around campus, was not allowed to build a couch swing for O-week, said student Michael Zhao. “In my knowledge that was the first time in 10 years that has happened,” he said. Senate will look into the matter.

Also blocked during O-week was a house show planned for one of the dorms in the Grove. Zhao was concerned that it may have had to do with a “BYOM” post on the event&#8217;s Facebook page by one of the page&#8217;s creators, an apparent reference to the drug MDMA. However, Director of Student Services Kristin Holmberg said it was cancelled because it was a public event planned in a non-public building, against college regulations, though she also said the “BYOM” post was troubling. Zhao was also concerned that a complaint made about the Facebook post was dishonorable in that the person who made the post was not contacted first.

Sustainability Committee has over $10,000 in frozen funds, which it cannot yet access, said former Sustainability Committee member (and Quest editor) Kieran Hanrahan. Senator Marie Perez, whose grandmother, adorably, was in attendance (and whose thesis, incidentally, is quite Cool and quite Of The Week), is looking into the matter and will work on freeing the funds up.

A breakdancing event sponsored by Red Bull will probably be held in the Student Union sometime around this October, mentioned student AnnaLise Bender-Brown. Finally—some dancing in the SU that isn&#8217;t drowning in either pitiful self-consciousness, or in alcohol. Or, in the case of the always-crowded Stop Making Sense, in other dancers.

Also brought up by students: We may be getting a Credit Union ATM in the GCCs (Vice President Aidan Sigman is working on it). We should plant fruit trees on campus (I would love that. Here&#8217;s hoping Bon Appetit doesn&#8217;t try to break out their non-competition clause that they use to block other food vendors on campus). Campus dog policy may be revised (sports center employees don&#8217;t like it because they can&#8217;t bring their dogs to work). And we&#8217;ll be getting a water fountain in the library (“it&#8217;s just a matter of time,” said Senator Ari Galper.)

Along with listening to the adamantine and incontrovertible Voice of the People, Senate allocated $394 to a one-time Zimbabwean music concert (that&#8217;s a Zimbabwean music concert that happens one time, not a concert of one-time Zimbabweans) and varying amounts under $100 to Fellatio Rodriguez, Wiffle Ball, and /uncommons/. Frontiers Human Rights requested $127, and the issue was tabled until they work out an issue with the proposal.

Maggie Black was appointed Senate Secretary, and Nina Clark was appointed to J-Board. Mirel Cohen&#8217;s appointment to J-Board was tabled until Senate discusses the matter further in an executive (that means private) session.

President Brian “the one with the goatee and the bandanas” Moore closed the meeting: “Shortest Senate meeting of the year. Done.”
