Gray light filters into the Performing Arts Building as Heidi Duckler ’74 brings the stairs in the atrium to life with her inventive choreography. Duckler, a Reed alumna of the Dance Department, was so inspired by the wooden stairs that she choreographed a site-specific piece to be performed on them for the opening festivities.

Through eerie melodies of a lone violin to the pulsing beats of Nicolas Jaar, each of the eight dancers proceeded up and down the stairs with grace and individuality. One dancer slithered slowly to the bottom of the stairs on her back. They slid down railings, fell across stairs, jumped around, and even used each other as steps and supports while remaining poised and assured in the beauty of their movements. The way the dancers progressed from one step to the next was not only the narrative of the piece but also served to highlight how site-specific the piece is. Duckler and her dancers used every aspect of the space, melding their bodies and movements with the area they were moving in.

Currently the Artistic Director of the Collage Dance Theatre, Duckler was also an active member in the Reed Dance Department during her time here. It was her dance company that performed the routine _L’esprit de l’escalier_ last Friday and Saturday. Her company includes not only style-specific professionals, but also two alumni: Claire Thomforde-Garner ’12 and Simone Wood ’13.

Duckler, who the Los Angeles Times called “the reigning queen of site-specific performance” takes unusual spaces and choreographs pieces to fit the space precisely. Some of her most praised works occurred at the Paul Hastings Towers in Los Angeles, a vacant lot in Glendale, California, a spin Cycle Laundromat in Los Angeles, Thong Chong Street in Hong Kong, and a laundrette in New York City.

The performance transformed the staircase into a work of art. Duckler’s routine raised the question of how future creative performance pieces will utilize the brand new Performance Arts Building. _L’esprit de l’escalier_ excited the spirit of the building, giving every step, door, and room potential for creative use.
