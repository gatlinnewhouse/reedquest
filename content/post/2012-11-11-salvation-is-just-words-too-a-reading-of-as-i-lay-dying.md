“Darl. Darl. Darl,” Lauren Nelson’s voice repeats as she stands on the altar in the chapel, dressed all in black, with glass encased tea candles burning down on the table beside her and Jimmy Curry IV, also all in black, looking on; it is a wake for Addie Bundren. Curry and Nelson, both freshmen, are reading aloud the entirety of William Faulkner’s _As I Lay Dying_. They started at noon, and it is now 4:42. They only have several pages to go, putting them far ahead of their estimated finishing time; they had booked the chapel until midnight.

Nelson said reading the book aloud had been an idea of Curry’s since their junior year in high school together. Curry was enamored with recording an audiobook in one sitting because, “it wasn’t pristine. If you sat and listened to an audiobook all the way through you would feel tired but the voice wouldn’t. Jimmy originally wanted to sit in my room for twenty four hours and just read, it didn’t matter what. I was just going to bring him food and check up on him every now and then, but we hadn’t done it because it was too difficult to find the time and space, not to mention explain to my parents why he was sitting in my room reading aloud to himself.”

They finally decided to fully commit to the challenges of speaking through an entire book in one sitting. The reason they picked _As I Lay Dying_ is because Nelson, worried about Jimmy going hoarse reading nonstop decided to join him on one condition: that they read her favorite book. She had also heard Curry read aloud parts of _The Sound and the Fury_ and thought he sounded particularly good speaking Faulkner.

They switched off every half hour, with Curry starting as Nelson ceremoniously lit the multitude of candles. In the beginning, they were subdued, but as the sun went down and the light of the candles filled the chapel, they got up and walked around, Curry hurriedly ate a sandwich while Nelson read, and Nelson sprawled across the chairs set up on the altar, book dangling from her hand as Curry paced, voice filling the chapel with Faulkner’s words. People came and left intermittently, and for a few hours sophomore Julia Selker drew on a roll of white butcher paper spread out in front of the pews, using the reading the inspire her.

Jade Novarino filmed most of the reading, shooting from different angles and recording audio. The recording and edited video will be free online soon. “The first couple of sections I read felt longer,” Nelson says when they’ve finished, “but then it began to get easier, by the end I just adjusted.” She had read the novel twice before. Asked whether she was paying attention while Curry spoke, Nelson said, “not really, I tuned out, I think I would go crazy staring at the page for that long; it got to the point where I could no longer process what I was reading.” Curry, who had never read the story felt the same way, “there were times when I drifted out, when I was speaking and not really listening, I feel like I got a good grip on the story but I don’t know the details all that well. Maybe I’ll read it again, but not for a long time.”

They read the last line of the story together, a spontaneous idea from Nelson. Curry didn’t realize it was the last line. Nelson says, “I knew it was the last line, that we were done and I wanted to say it too.”
