Reedies Mentor Brentwood Middle Schoolers at Local K-8</em>

**Julia Lee**

A bell shakes the air, ushering stampedes of small children out of their classrooms and down the hallway. A handful congregate near the school’s front entrance, by six Reed students. “What were you for Halloween?” asks Kelsey Lucas ‘11. “The guardian of hell,” a 7th-grade blonde boy replies.

And another day of mentoring is underway.

The Lane After School Education with Reed program (LASER) was set up by a group of three Reedies in 2001. The goal of the Lane-Reed partnership is to provide the middle-school students with otherwise unavailable classroom assistance, consistent after-school classes, and one-on-one mentor relationships while granting Reed students the opportunity to a valuable first-hand experience in education.

“LASER gets Reedies out into the world! They aren’t doing homework, they aren’t in a conference, and they aren’t at their desk in the library. Instead, they are building relationships with the community, each other, and a Lane student,” says Lucas, program manager.

Mentoring takes place on Mondays and Wednesdays, in an hour-long session after the Lane school day. The LASER mentors walk their mentees to a large classroom where they are free to use the games and supplies (partially funded by Reed) at their leisure. Activities include baking, basketball, and board games, but the successes of LASER stretch far beyond a win in Monopoly.

“Since our time partnering with Lane, the school has gone from being on its fourth year of failing to meet ‘adequate yearly progress’, a standard of the No Child Left Behind law, to seeing steadily increasing test scores in almost every area in all grade levels and being praised as one of Portland’s most successful schools that serves a majority of students living in poverty,” says SEEDS coordinator Fawn Livingston-Gray.

The mentor-mentee partnerships are initially established based on observed compatibility, and maintained throughout the course of the year and beyond. The longest relationship has spanned nearly two and a half years now.

“The mentors are a wonderful asset to Lane,” said Josh Wells, site manager for SUN (Schools Uniting Neighborhoods) Community Schools at Lane. “The students in the program get a unique opportunity to develop a relationship that can help guide them through the challenging middle school years.”

Occasionally Lane students have to drop mentoring. “Sometimes kids will not be doing well in school so their parents won’t let them stay after, or sometimes someone will move to Idaho. Some things are just out of our control,” Lucas said.

Reciprocal participation is key to the program’s success, says Sammy Massey. “There has to be the interest in the kids that sign up and then there’s the attentiveness of the mentors. It seems like generally, really great relationships come out of it.”

Plus, it’s fun, and almost anyone can do it. There are currently around 20 Reedies participating as mentors. SEEDS requires an application, an interview, and a clean criminal record, but once the student is cleared, training and support meetings are provided. The school is a comfortable two miles away, but free bus tickets are also provided for the mentors.

“It is awesome. [Reed students] are really fun to play with and they’re good people to make you laugh. All of them are funny,” said Angel, an 8th-grader in the program. “We also play fun games like turtle tag,” adds Angel.

And the Reedies are getting something out of it too: perspective. “It’s an understatement to say it’s important to pay attention to how kids are being educated. They’ll tell you how they feel about school and it gives insight into how they’re affected by it,” says Massey.

Along with mentoring, SEEDS has an in-class internship program set up with LANE, and various other volunteer opportunities in the education field like Voz, SMART, and Project Eye to Eye, an art-based mentoring program for students with learning disabilities. They are all ideal volunteer positions, requiring the exchange of a few hours out of a student’s schedule for the possibility of making a positive impact on a community member.

“I think many Reedies are very touched by their experiences at Lane,” Lucas said. “Lane is a very high poverty school, [with] 87% [of students] on free and reduced lunch, and very racially diverse.

We talk a lot with mentors about encountering these issues and what they can do, but I think more than anything, it is about the connection.”
