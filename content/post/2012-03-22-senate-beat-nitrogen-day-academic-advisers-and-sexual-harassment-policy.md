Senate addressed Nitrogen Day funding, plans to evaluate academic advisers, and the revised Discriminatory Harassment Policy in its meeting this week. The meeting began with Chris Cogell, Signator of the blues-dancing club, checking in with Senate to make sure off-campus guests could come to an event being held this weekend in the sports center. Senate saw no problems with Chris’ request.

Next, Andrew McNutt took the floor to discuss Nitrogen Day (April 7<sup>th</sup>). McNutt discussed Finance Committee’s decision to not fund the use of a dome for a second dance party with Student Body Vice President Aidan Sigman, emphasizing the importance of giving students options during this event. Sigman said that the price was too high for the small number of individuals who would be able to dance in the dome, and that bringing the dome out on fewer occasions makes the experience of dancing in the dome more memorable. The two came to a compromise when McNutt requested hosting the second dance in Winch Capeheart. Senate agreed that they would help fund the second dance in that location.

With no more visitor requests, Senate went through the news and notes of their past week’s events. The highlight from Finance Committee occurred when Sigman revealed that $3000 was not allocated to the Bring Cool People to Reed, Please Club. The club wanted to invite a comedy troupe, but Finance Committee felt that the price was too high for this late in the year,and that the troupe requested an audience of less than 100 students.

Senator Ari Galper said that the Student Committee of Academic Policy and Planning is in the process of collecting responses from a survey recently sent out asking whether students would want to evaluate their academic advisors. With early returns, Galper said it seemed there was approval for an evaluation process from the student body, so such a plan may soon be submitted to SCAPP.

As a final highlight, Senator John Iselin ’14 noted that the Election Czar positions have been filled by Alex Blum ’14 and Jacob Canter ’14. Additionally, new positions will soon be out for students, including Assistant SU Manager, Student Body Handbook Editor, Honor Council, and J-Board. Iselin wanted to encourage everyone to let the student body know about the positions now available.

Senate discussed last the revised Discriminatory Harassment Policy. The policy is meant to be a supplement to the existing Sexual Harassment Policy. No major changes were made to the policy, except to make the language more clear and explicit concerning the opportunities students have to respond to harassment. All responses were very positive in regards to the policy, and it was quickly motioned to be sent to Mike Brody and Paul Hovda on the Community Affairs Committee.

The surprisingly short Senate meeting of about thirty-five minutes left everyone in high spirits.
