**World News:**

&#8211; On February 11th, after 18 days of protest, the autocratic President Hosni Mubarak finally stepped down from the position of power he had been holding for the past 30 years. His departure marked the initial success of the second revolutionary movement in the Middle East – the first coming in Tunisia, where protests forced President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to leave his post on January 14, 2011.

**Entertainment:** 

&#8211; At the Grammys, Lady Antebellum received five awards, the most of any artist this year, and Arcade Fire’s “The Suburbs” won the award for Album of the Year. Justin Bieber didn’t win any awards, a surprise since he was the favorite for Best New Artist.

&#8211; This weekend on the popular NPR show “This American Life”, Ira Glass reveals what he believes to be the secret recipe for Coca-Cola. The radio show found the recipe in the newspaper the Atlantic Journal-Constitution, from February 18th, 1979, the hometown of the Coca-Cola Company.

**Politics:**

&#8211; Both the Republicans and the White House have proposed budgets to decrease the national deficit, which currently is lingering at around 3.7 trillion dollars, and will not subside without serious cutbacks implemented. The Republican budget has been given the catchy slogan of “Eat the Future”, because it emphasizes cuts on programs that don’t effect the American public now, but could have drastic effects on our future. The Obama budget proposes to stop discretionary spending for the next five years, but that only accounts for one-fifth of the national budget. Neither the White House, nor Republicans, has put any serious thought into raising taxes.
