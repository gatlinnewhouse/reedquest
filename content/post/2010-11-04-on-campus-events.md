Wednesday, November 10

Five years have passed since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. Even after five years, still more than 50,000 of the city’s houses — about 27 percent — remain vacant. This is the highest proportion of any city in the country. Join ten of your fellow Reedies and make a direct impact on the community of New Orleans by volunteering with NOLA Habitat for Humanity

For more information and the application, visit the SEEDS website at <http://web.reed.edu/seeds>, stop by our office at GCC-104, or e-mail [Dana Bays][1]. Applications are due November 15 at 5:00pm.

FREE Gardasil (HPV Vaccine) Available
  
Wednesday, November 10, 17
  
10:00am-12:00pm, space TBA
  
Thursday, November 11, 18
  
2:00-4:00pm, space TBA**

The Health and Counseling Center is pleased to announce that we have received a limited supply of free Gardasil vaccine through a government program. This supply is available to female students and can be used to start or complete the 3-shot series. A courtesy rsvp email to [Anne Kimberly][2] stating which clinic you will attend is appreciated, but the clinics are also open without rsvp. We do have a separate supply of Gardasil available for sale for males (and females when the free supply runs out) at $130/shot. Most insurance plans (including the Reed Aetna plan) are covering the cost of vaccination at 80% but interested students with other private insurance plans will need to contact their plans for verification of reimbursement.

**Elections Assembly
  
Thursday, November 11 at 7:00pm in the SU**

Elections season is here, and before you know it you will have a new president, vice president, for new senators, and a new Quest board. Participate in the democratic process by voting, but first come to Elections Assembly to hear what your candidates have to say. Candidates will be giving speeches and taking questions. Be there!

**Face-To-Face Tour and Film
  
Thursday, November 11 at 7:00-8:30pm in Vollum Lecture Hall**

Invisible Children presents the Face-To-Face Tour: Stories of War and GO Documentary. The organization Invisible Children has been documenting the child soldiers in Uganda through film, so that people around the world can become more aware of what is going on. This fall, they have a film they will be showing, and there will be two Ugandan students, ex-child soldiers, to speak at the event! Anyone who is an idealist, an activist, anyone interested in making a difference, should come listen for an hour and a half to something totally unlike our own lives. It should be phenomenal. This is a free event, and there will be merchandise to buy if you are interested.

**Lecture by Christina Romer, President Obama’s Chief Economic Adviser

As chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (January 2009-September 2010), Christina Romer was one of the four economics principals who met with President Obama daily to design and guide the administration’s response to the Great Recession. She played a key role in macroeconomic policy, the rescue and reform of the financial system, health care reform, and budget policy. In addition, she was a primary spokesperson on the economy for the administration, appearing frequently on the evening news, in the financial press, and on the Sunday morning news programs.
