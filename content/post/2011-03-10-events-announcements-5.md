**EVENTS** 

**ALANA Studies Presents Dinner & Discussion w/ Yan Li: “From Tiger Moms to Model Minority: Understanding Race and Diversity through Asian American Assimilation”**
  
**Thursday, 3/10**
  
**6:30 PM, VOL 120**
  
We will discuss the publication and publicity of Amy Chua’s memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother and how it stirred up a heated debate on effective parenting- much of which surrounds the clash between Chinese/Asian and American/Western values that are responsible for the seemingly higher success rate of Asian American children in school and adults in the labor market. In this discussion, we will unpack this central premise of Asians being the model minority and look at how assimilation (in particular, successful educational and economic achievements) is segmented among Asian Americans of different ethnic backgrounds and different immigrant generations. We will discuss the implication of this for second generation Asian Americans (in comparison to other second generation immigrants such as West Indians and Mexicans) in terms of their racial and ethnic identities, and consequently, how these processes illustrate the way race is done in the U.S.

**CARNAVAL**
  
**Friday, 3/11**
  
**10:00 PM, Winch**
  
This Friday the Spanish House brings you CARNAVAL! Dress up for a chance to win a NEW BIKE or a DINNER AT A LATIN-AMERICAN RESTAURANT. It’s like Spanish Halloween, but with a Latin dance party. There will also be costume photos.

**GET NAKED 2**
  
**Friday, March 11**
  
**10:00 PM, Chittick**
  
Last January, masses of dancing Reedies (nude and non-nude) engaged in the earotic pleasures of Get Naked: an electro dance party, set on navigating your bod through the expanses of house music. This Friday, Get Naked returns in all its loud, rhythmic, and questionably-dressed glory: DJ sets, lights, and sweating bodies included. Let us undress you with our ears once again. Get Naked 2.

**The Vagina Monologues**
  
**Friday, 3/11 – Saturday, 3/12**
  
**7:00 PM, Chapel**
