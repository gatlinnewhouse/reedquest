On Friday, January 27th, student groups came together in the Student Union to raise awareness about their clubs in the Activities Fair that marks the beginning of every semester.

While not a particularly exciting event to begin with—relative to the Activities Fair in the Fall—the event was made worse by the fact that it took place in the crowded and cramped Student Union when it was perfectly nice, if a little cold, outside. While the precaution is understandable, considering Portland&#8217;s unpredictable weather, it was quite a disappointment, as it wouldn&#8217;t have been too hard to move all the tables outside a half-an-hour or so before the event.

That aside, the event wasn&#8217;t all negative. The Activities Fair was filled with the bribes that groups use to get people to Top 6 them. These bribes seem to have become the driving factor for attendance! (Personally, I have no problem with that as I found the cookies, brownies, and candy to be quite delicious—though that only makes sense as, had the snacks been bad, my vote may have changed!)

Carnivorous Alternatives to Vegetarian Eating (CAVE) even had a full-on barbecue and the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room) displayed some very good comics to entice more people to Top 6 their club.<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/02/student-groups-hustle-members-tops-sixes-in-su/img_9750/" rel="attachment wp-att-1223"><br /> </a>

This attitude has permeated the event to such an extent that there was even popcorn and a chocolate fountain to be found off to the South end of the Student Union that had no apparent connection to any particular group. Again, no complaints!<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/02/student-groups-hustle-members-tops-sixes-in-su/img_9750/" rel="attachment wp-att-1223"><br /> </a>

In the next few days it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see a horde of posters spontaneously appear around campus, promoting various groups. Despite that, though, many view Funding Poll cynically, saying that the results change little from semester to semester because there are some groups that will always be in demand. I personally think it would be kind of awesome to see some newer groups top the charts. That said, good luck to all the groups participating this semester!
