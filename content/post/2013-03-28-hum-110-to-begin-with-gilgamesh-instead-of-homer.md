The epic of _Gilgamesh_ will replace the _Odyssey_ as the first book discussed by freshman in Hum 110. The faculty committee overseeing the Hum 110 syllabus is revising the syllabus, which is in its final stages of completion, in order to provide a more holistic approach to the ancient Mediterranean world. Hum 110 will not begin with Homer for the first time in the course’s history, though the _Iliad_ will still be sent to freshmen to read over the summer.

Hum 110 will be ordered more chronologically and organized into two-week blocks. The blocks will begin with Mesopotamia, followed by Egypt, the Tanakh, and then the _Iliad_.  In the second semester, the new syllabus will give more attention to the development of early Christianity, which the current syllabus overlooks. Apuleius’s _The Golden Ass_ will conclude the new syllabus, a reversion to the syllabus prior to the current one.

&#8220;If the foundation of these changes is to alter the Western-centric view of the Mediterranean, then it makes sense to move away from the idea of Homer as the inventor of the epic,&#8221; says English Department Chair and Hum Professor Nathalia King. “If we are to make a serious attempt to look at other cultures as autonomous cultures with their own art, views, and understandings of truth and goodness, then it is important to look at their epics.&#8221;

The Hum 110 faculty conducted many meetings and votes over the course of the year. They drafted an outline and created a subcommittee to revise the draft. Two groups drafted two different syllabi, one spearheaded by Professor of Classics and Humanities Walter Englert, the other by Professor of History and Humanities David Garrett. Though similar in design, the syllabi differed in scope, like the duration and depth of the study of Mesopotamia and the placement of early Christianity. The new syllabus represents a synthesis of these two drafts.

The faculty believes that _Gilgamesh_ is a good place to begin not only because it predates the other texts, but because it also contains many themes that appear throughout Hum 110. Freshman reading the epic will be exposed to recurrent themes like the limitations of human knowledge, the impermanence of life, and the nature of friendship. These ideas help underscore the relationship between Mesopotamian and Greek thought.

However, these changes have their critics. &#8220;I think it might be valuable for Reedies of different classes to have different Hum experiences, although it is nice to have a cultural unity among the years,&#8221; Hum tutor Jimmy LaBelle &#8217;15 says. &#8220;The one thing about Hum that I really like is that everyone has to do the same thing so everyone has these inside jokes that we get to bond over.&#8221;

Others believe that the change is for the better. Seniors can rejoice that the _Iliad_ has returned to Reed lore. “It’s great,” Richard Aldersley ’13 says. “It sounds way better than the first changes they made.”
