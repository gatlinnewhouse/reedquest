The Spanish House&#8217;s common room provided a comfortable setting for Eva Núñez Méndez and her modest audience of Spanish aficionados–curious passersby from the exotic halls of Sequoia, _ceseantes_ and _seseantes_ from vibrant Buenos Aires, and your _reportero_ from _The Quest_. Méndez, an associate professor of Spanish at Portland State University who earned a Ph.D. in Spanish Linguistics from the University of Salamanca, succinctly covered the development of the Spanish language from its beginnings as _castellano primitivo_ (c. 1000) to its spread throughout the Caribbean, México, and South America during the colonization of the Americas. She even managed to include some neologisms resulting from Spanish’s contact with caribbean _lenguas_, Nahuatl dialects, and the Quechua languages.

One of Méndez’s points was the importance of differentiating _español_ from _castellano_. The former term denotes a kind of umbrella term that accounts for most variations of the Spanish language, while the latter refers to the language which originated in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula and had significant contact with the _vascos_ (Basque people) early in the language’s development. Méndez attributed this to the strong nationalism and regionalism common throughout the peninsula. (There are five official languages in the peninsula: Spanish (or castilian), Portuguese, Aragonese, Asturian, and Catalan.) The reasons for this peninsular polyglot, Méndez said, are geographic, historical, and sociopolitical. Their proximity has shaped their courses and forged distinct cultural identities.

Méndez moved from talking about Spain’s polyglotism and pointed to an odd difference in the Spanish spoken in modern-day Spain and that spoken in Latin America: the _ceseo,_ the lisp sound heard in Spanish for “c”s and “z”s. Though much of modern-day Spain retains the _ceseo_, Latin America maintains the _seseo_ (in which “s”s and “z”s are pronounced like “s”s). There’s a common myth which attributes the _ceceo_ to a Spanish king with a speech impediment who made his servants and kingdom speak like him, though Méndez staunchly rejects this claim. “It doesn’t have any scientific base,” she said. Instead, she proposed that the reason for the dialect differences is due to a later development of the _ceceo_ in Spain because of linguistic interaction with other peninsular languages. The _ceseo_ happened much “later than the colonization of the Americas” in the early 16th century, said Méndez. This means that Spain exported a _seseante_ Spanish which was readily adopted by most of Latin America as the language continued its continental expansion.

Méndez concluded her lecture by highlighting Spanish’s absorption of native amerindian words from different amerindian dialects, which now form a significant part of standard Spanish vocabulary. For example, words like _barbacoa_ (barbeque), _canoa_ (canoe), _huracán_ (hurricane), _hamaca_ (hammock), _maíz_ (maize), and _tabaco_ (tobacco) all come from the caribbean dialect Taíno. From the Nahuatl, a language native to southern México and Central America, Spanish borrows _aguacate_ (avocado)_, pozole, coyote, chocolate,_ and _tequila._ From the Andes’ Quechua, Spanish gets the words _coca_, _gaucho_ (South American cowboy), _pisco_ (Peruvian brandy), _pampa_ (South American plain),  _puma_, __and _maté_ (South American drink and a Reedie favorite). These and many more amerindian words, Méndez said, have become part of Spanish’s lexicon. Méndez added that more contemporary neologisms such as _googlear_ (to google)_, chatear_ (to chat)_,_ and _checar_ (to check) have been quickly adopted by the Spanish language as a result of dynamic linguistic interaction between English and Spanish.

The lecture concluded with a round of applause and enthusiastic chatter in a multiplicity of Latin American, Spanish, and American accents. Méndez’s new book _Fundamentos teóricos y prácticos de historia de la lengua española_ was published in April and will be available in the Reed Bookstore soon.
