Reed College has pledged to financially back the student group TEDxReedCollege, which is planning a conference for next November. TED is a renowned nonprofit dedicated to disseminating ideas about diverse subject matter including art, culture, politics, science. Such influential people as Al Gore, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, and Jane Goodall have given talks for TED’s global conference series that seeks to spread inspiring stories and ideas. TEDx is a derivative of TED that gives third parties, like colleges and universities, licenses to host conferences in their area. Reed&#8217;s event will feature several speakers planning to share their original ideas, as well as previously recorded TEDTalks from official TED events.

Jeremy Melloul, the TEDxReedCollege group signator, explained that the “event is being backed by Reed as an institution and not Student Body funds.” The group gained the approval of the administration after Melloul pitched the idea to Crystal Williams, Dean of Institutional Diversity, and then to President Colin Diver. Administration support facilitates the group’s efforts in acquiring certification for future conferences.

Mike Brody, Dean of Student Services, will be the certification holder for the TEDx group, which he will receive after attending a TED Active event in Palm Springs. With this certification, the conference will be able to host more than 100 people, the maximum number of people TED allows without certification. The event, Melloul explained, will likely host 700 people and will be open to the Portland community. The group has not yet decided upon ticket prices but is trying to offer the event free for Reed Students. Seats will be given on a lottery basis to Reed students. Members of the TEDxReedCollege group will be able to meet the speakers and are guaranteed a seat at the conference.

With universities all around the world becoming involved in TED programs, Melloul noted the importance of joining the network. He explained that “being a part of the program connects Reed to a global community of people” and expands the college’s reach to outside of the bubble.
