Auden Lincoln-Vogel’s &#8217;12 studio sits in the far eastern corner of Reed&#8217;s art building. Various art supplies, past projects, posters, and papers line the walls and tables, embellished here and there by a typewriter, a clothes hanger lined with dangling keys, and a half-serious contract allowing him to borrow a friend&#8217;s scooter. It all creates the sort of artful chaos one would expect from a Russian/Studio Art major in the middle of his thesis work. Indeed, taking up most of the room is a key part of Auden&#8217;s project: a white, clay model of an apartment, containing only a simple bed, a desk, a chair, and a computer. With this, Auden plans to create his stop-motion animation thesis on the surreal and bizarre art of Russian animator Igor Kovalyov.

Auden, from Andover, Massachusetts, is working on his thesis with Professors Lena Lencek, of the Russian Department, and Geri Ondrizek, of the Art Department. Because of his ad hoc major, Auden&#8217;s thesis will be comprised of two parts: a written element, which he worked on last semester, and a studio art element, the animation. Both parts will address an animation by Kovalyov entitled &#8220;Hen, His Wife,&#8221; in which a man fails to realize that his wife is clearly a chicken until a visitor comes and informs him of it. &#8220;He kicks the visitor out,&#8221; says Auden, &#8220;and then there&#8217;s this extended dream sequence. Finally, the visitor returns, and he&#8217;s half transformed into a chicken, and she runs away from him.&#8221;

In the written section of his thesis, Auden touches on the historical context of &#8220;Hen, His Wife,&#8221; which Kovalyov created in the early 1990s during glasnost. In the Soviet Union, glasnost was a thawing period under which the government reduced censorship and Soviet citizens were allowed more freedoms of expression. &#8220;There was sort of this ambiguity between whether something new has happened or whether you just discovered something that was there all along,&#8221; he says. Like the main character in &#8220;Hen, His Wife&#8221; realizing his wife was a chicken, Auden gives the real-life example of the Soviet government paving over ethnic differences. This changed during glasnost, says Auden, and &#8220;it was unclear–was it like this all along, or is this something new?&#8221;

Auden, however, concerns himself more with the devices that Kovalyov uses in his animation than on the animation&#8217;s historical context or any explicit meaning. A large part of the written element of Auden&#8217;s thesis is comparing the function of the surreal in Kovalyov&#8217;s animations to earlier Soviet surrealist animations, including the 1968 film &#8220;The Glass Harmonica&#8221; by Andrey Khrzhanovskiy, which was a thinly veiled critique of the Soviet government. In &#8220;The Glass Harmonica&#8221; there is &#8220;a sudden descent into surreal chaos,&#8221; whereas in &#8220;Hen, His Wife,&#8221; the surreal is &#8220;continuous and cycling,&#8221; Auden explains.

&#8220;There are ways in which certain expectations are constantly falling apart,&#8221; says Auden, which gives &#8220;Hen, His Wife&#8221; its surrealist, bizarre bent. For example, Auden explains that the animation will look relatively stable, but then, as the camera pans across a setting, an object in the corner will melt at the last second before it goes out of view. &#8220;So I&#8217;m interested in the technical means [by which Kovalyov produces] certain affects that distort the meaning of the overall piece,&#8221; Auden says.

Auden hopes to create similar surreal effects in his animation. To produce the animation, Auden must take pictures of his model apartment, moving the camera up a small amount before he takes each successive picture. Then, he&#8217;ll rearrange the furniture, making it look like a new apartment, and start taking pictures over again. The effect, Auden says, will be to make the final movie look like it&#8217;s panning upwards, looking into various apartments in a highrise building until it stops on a single apartment.

The second half of the animation will feature a clay man going to sleep. To make the men, Auden will use a green screen effect, making their different body parts appear to be different, seemingly random images. For instance, Auden will use different colors to create the eyes, body, and mouth of a clay man; then, in the editing process, he will assign the body to be a moving image of burning fire, the eyes to be swimming fish, and the mouth to be a continuous stream of vomit.

Auden&#8217;s enigmatic thesis was inspired by his view of Kovalyov as an enigmatic figure. As Auden explains it, &#8220;The primary reason i got into Kovalyov is that I don&#8217;t understand what the fuck he’s doing.&#8221;
