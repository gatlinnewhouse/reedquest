It was a drizzly Saturday in Pioneer Square. I had arrived early to get some homework done while I had a cup of coffee. On the corner, a group of young proselytizers banged on their Bibles and shouted: “Show me one scientist who can do what Our Lord has done! He is our almighty God, risen from the grave to forgive our sins!”

Then, the zombies started arriving.

Before long, the square was overrun with the living dead and the evangelists admitted defeat. In attendance for the Portland Zombie Walk were child zombies, a Lady Gaga zombie, hipster zombies, and nerd zombies. Particularly entertaining to watch was one zombie couple who, when they weren’t scaring small children, insisted on sucking face in front of everyone. (I say “sucking face” because if I was to say “biting face” or “munching face”–which are both closer to the truth of the matter–you might not know what I meant.)

Standing amidst these undead faces, I was struck by the overwhelming variety of afterlifestyles milling about in the square. A dejected looking woman with a mentholated Marlboro dangling from her mouth and a Hamm’s in her hand rubbed shoulders with a giggling group of tweenaged zombie party-girls as they trundled past Macy’s; across the street from Nordstrom, a steampunk couple trudged alongside the alive-again twins from The Shining. It was spectacular to watch.

As I biked home, though, I couldn’t help but think: aren’t we all a little dead inside?

Whether we’re shuffling around moaning for brains or plodding home from the library bemoaning our remaining homework, we’re all looking for something to fill the void. Our gaunt flesh–whether the lack of blood or Vitamin D is to blame, it doesn’t really matter–longs to touch the living skin of another. Whether our intention is to caress or eat it, it’s all the same. And really, if you think about it, couldn’t the Reed Bubble just be our own rationalization for a quarantine in which we’ve been placed by Portland proper?

Like zombies, though, we really can’t do anything about any of this. So, unable to stop ourselves, we trudge forward with a singular focus on brains, hoping to better our own and eat that of our neighbor.
