The bagel subverts its thing-ness with this suggestion of no-thing. Does a bagel have buddha-nature? The answer is neither yes nor no; it is not. It is, and is not, the bagel-void.

The thesis of this lecture is this is not a lecture.

_Bagyl! Bagyl! burning bright / In fluorescent commons light, / What mortal Reedie would not shy / from thy existential quandary?_ None can say whether we can know anything with certainty and the bagel-void be paved over; the Christians say, Yes, in having faith that Jesus died for my sins, the truth follows; the Jews say, Yes turn to scripture, in scripture we find the truth; the Buddhists just smile and chew on their bagels; the fish ignore the question and filter oxygen through their gills, or can we really know that they do. I can’t know for sure that the bagel sits on my folding desk in Vollum during nine o’clock lectures because what is a desk anyway, Plato, show me the form of a desk. Plato, I know you really just ripped off Parmenides, and he, in his insufficient wisdom, told us to ignore the bagel-void and look only at the dough. Plato, your teacher failed to frame the question properly and sent Western Philosophy on a millennia-long boar hunt in which we earned more than one tusk-scar on our legs. Plato, _The Republic_ was not that great of a poem and you confused more people than you enlightened, and look, now they’re trying to perform a political science reading of it; it’s just as productive as trying to pull the ideal system of governance out of “Howl.” Academicians will do anything if you promise them a lecture in which they get to use words “liminality,” and “interplay.”

The liminality, that academicians’ ten-dollar word, of the bagel, the interplay and co-mingling of thing-ness and no-thing-ness is inherently sexual, but this coupling of bagel-void and bagel-dough is not a coupling of life and life but one of death and life, the invagination of Venus by Tartarus.

In the face of this bagel-void, what do we do? Hands in pockets and a downward glare cannot justify an existence. (Renn Fayre is meaningless, says the bagel-void, Thesis Parade is meaningless; you have to set fire to the christmas tree hanging from the Blue Bridge; “A man must,” Kimon Friar said, recounting Nikos Kazantzakis’ philosophy, “then embrace the annihilating abyss without any hope, he must say that nothing exists, neither life nor death, and must accept this necessity bravely, with exultation and song. He may then build the affirmative structure of his life over this abyss in an ecstasy of tragic joy.” Creeley asks in his poem “I Know a Man,” “the darkness sur- / rounds us, what / can we do against / it,” and answers, “buy a goddamn big car, / drive” despite the bagel-void, to spite the bagel-void, but, “for / christ’s sake, look / out where yr going.”)

I wait in line to put cream cheese on my bagels before my nine o’clock lectures and fail to justify my waiting to myself, but still I put the cream cheese on, and, sometimes, it fills the bagel-void.
