Reed College can be a tough place for new students. Odds are, if you’re going here, you weren’t very cool in high school. But think: There are plenty of people here who were even lamer than you were; this is your time to shine, to become king of this social molehill! As I’ve been here for three years I know a lot about the place. I’m at the peak of my social and academic career. People come up to me every day and ask me: “Schwartz, how did you get to be so cool?” And so I feel it’s my earned place and, indeed, moral responsibility to give you a few tips on how to be cool and handle your social life responsibly at Reed. Here’s how I’ve managed it:

1. Beer fairies are cool. So make sure to sleep with the first upperclassman who gives you a beer, and don’t wear a condom. Think of it this way: You’re naturally selecting for a future upperclassmen cohort full of more awesome beer fairies.

2. Love is free, love is wild. But sex with people you don’t know so well is gross, full of possible health consequences, and makes you a whore. Make sure you sleep only with people whose sexual history you know fully. This means sleeping with people who are as interconnected with you as possible, so you can monitor them and make sure they haven’t been sleeping with anyone unhygienic or injecting themselves with dirty needles. As added bonus, they’ll be around you all the time, so you can update them on your health status or the fact that you haven’t gotten pregnant from making out with them in the closet pretty much every day.

3. Reed is a very stressful place. When the stress gets to you it’s important to stay informed. Make sure you read every available resource on stress relief, and spend at least two hours every day googling “stress” and then surfing through Wikipedia pages related to the topic. When this research is done, it’s important to go down into the library lobby and spend at least two hours informing everyone of how stressed you are, and letting them know all the time you’ve spent researching stress and what you’ve learned. One particularly good way I’ve found of dealing with stress is boxing on a heavy bag without a wrap. If you are down in the library lobby talking about how stressed you are, I highly advise you try this tactic.

4. People who can be offended by things are more serious and important than everyone around them. Find a hot-button issue to be offended about, such as killing moths. That way every time someone kills a moth around you, you can say: “Moth killing — I object to that morally.” This will make you seem informed and cause everyone in the room to respect you more. For extra points, write in an article to the Quest on the Culture of Moth Killing at Reed so everyone will know how informed and progressive you are.

5. Hitting on a girl can be stressful for a guy and takes guts. So people who are frank and honest about how they pursue someone deserve a reward. If sex is out of the question (and, let’s face it, they’re a Reed guy and you’re a Reed girl, the odds of sex occurring are pretty low) consider giving them some kind of food, like a fruit, before you send them on their way.

6. Conference isn’t about intellectual discussion, it’s about who cares more. Remember item 4 and make sure to be offended at every unconventional line of inquiry. There is no topic academic enough that you can’t find a reason to be offended about it. Remember: 95% of Math classes still hold students to the hegemony of the so-called “Axiom of Choice.” For extra points, make sure to storm out of class in the middle of discussions so as to show how serious a person you are. This will truly lead your professor to respect you more.

7. Reed men are pigs. Women, if you are looking for a partner I highly suggest PSU keggers as a place to meet nice boys who will treat you right. Alternatively, write the Quest to get in touch with my twin brother, José. He has to return to Mexico later this week, but his off-kilter handlebar mustache and heavy accent will no doubt charm you. He’ll totally write, provided his plane back to Acapulco doesn’t suddenly and mysteriously crash in the gulf.

8. Toothpaste is an important and scarce resource. If you suspect your toothpaste is being stolen, accuse everyone with access to it of the theft. Ideally, do this in public. For extra points, make sure their parents and academic adviser are there.

9. Hum lecture is the most serious part of your Reed education, and all of the lectures you attend will prove useful to you in later life. Showing up tired and nodding off during these lectures is completely unacceptable, and new senate bylaw changes will soon make this offense punishable by stoning at the hands of the English department.

Thesis: make sure you do it on a country that you know nothing about, and that your data is in a language you don’t speak. Ideally, the data should only be available in a location it takes you three hours to drive to. This means you’re truly doing your thesis right.

11. Student senate is almost as important and influential as real senate. Take its issues seriously, and make sure you run for and win office. To do this, simply wait until there are about as many slots open on Senate as candidates, and then slip through on the basis of people assuming you’re the same as that other guy who was on Senate with your name. It won’t be awkward at all when people keep calling you “Phil”.

12. Missed connections are a fun and quirky way of meeting people, much like being caught spying on them from the sidewalk with binoculars, but more public.

Remember, kids: If all these tips fail, you can always make yourself cool by writing an advice column in the Quest. Much love to my fellow LC-member Zach and to the freshling, I hope they realize I do this only because I have no serious advice to give.

PEACE.
