Welcome to Reed, freshling! Portland is home to a great food culture, and Southeast in particular, with its quiet residential neighborhoods and tree-lined boulevards, has numerous delicious and accessible options. You&#8217;ve likely already discovered nearby institutions like Tom Yum, the Delta, and Saburo. We at the Quest** **have compiled a list of some of our favorite Southeast Portland eateries** **for you to check out when you&#8217;re not busy with your Hum reading.

**Phở Hung (4717 SE Powell)**

The delicious fragrance of simmering soup** **greets you as you enter this unassuming establishment. Portland is home to a sizable Vietnamese population and this is a great place to sample their cuisine. It&#8217;s a franchise, but its success is due to its being really, really good.****

Phở, a tasty, nourishing noodle soup is, as the name implies, the specialty here, and the options range from basic (chicken in chicken broth) to adventurous (beef, fatty brisket, tendon, and tripe). There&#8217;s also a range of other offerings, including Bánh Mì—sandwiches on French bread—and a few vegetarian options, but between you and me, I&#8217;ve never tried any of it because the Phở is so damn good. Everything comes with tea, and the best part is that the soup will only set you back $6.50.

****By bike, go north on Cesar Chavez and turn right on Powell. It&#8217;s ahead, at 47<sup>th</sup>, on the left side.

By bus, take the 75 to Powell and walk up to 47<sup>th</sup>.

**Little T American Baker (2600 SE Division)**

Just a few blocks away from Broder on Division, this modern, airy bakery makes a refreshing change from the all too common funky Portland atmosphere. Serving good coffee and great pastries, it&#8217;s a nice place to unwind or get a little work done away from the pressure cooker of campus. You can also get a good, if somewhat pricey breakfast there. Try the wonderfully light baked currant doughnuts.

By bike, go north on 28<sup>th</sup> Ave. until you get to Division. Turn left and go two blocks. It&#8217;s on the left side, on the corner.

By bus, go to Cesar Chavez to take the 75 to Division. From there you can take the 4 westbound or walk to 26<sup>th</sup>. The bakery is on the left.
