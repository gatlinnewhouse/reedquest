Despite financial concerns last semester, plans for erecting a new Performing Arts Building are proceeding. There have been few outward signs of progress on the building, which will bring together the Dance, Music and Theatre departments in one space for the first time, since the groundbreaking at Centennial Reunions this summer.

The proposed site, the lawn between Anna Mann and Kaul Auditorium, has been empty so far. “It’s about to change,” says Opsis Architecture associate John Shorb, who is working on the project. Details for the building design are still being finalized, but the construction will begin in a phased process so that the project can be completed on time. Construction is scheduled to start in October.

The new building will have larger and better equipped facilities, such as a 180-seat studio theatre with moveable seating platforms, a choir rehearsal hall, and a dance studio with sprung wood floors. Plans for the building, which are on display in the foyer outside Kaul Auditorium, also boast a Winter Garden atrium that will serve as the main hub of the building. The architects are pursuing sustainability certification with Earth Advantage, a pilot program based locally in Portland. In anticipation of audience needs, the architects have increased the number of stalls in the women’s restroom and included a single-stall restroom that will serve as a gender-neutral restroom on the main floor. Faculty offices for all departments will be adjacent to one another.

“I’m excited about the critical mass of energy that we can generate in that space,” says Kathleen Worley, Professor of Theatre. Faculty hope that sharing a building will spark off ideas for collaboration. In 1996, there was a production of _Beggar’s Opera_ by John Gay that brought together the three departments, though there has been nothing comparable since then. The increased proximity will not only encourage collaboration among faculty, but also among students in the arts. With few shared spaces, Worley finds that “it really is hard for students to know what other students in the arts are doing.”

In the existing music practice rooms, however, students may be too aware of each other’s work. The thin walls in Prexy, the music building, have posed a problem for students. Denise VanLeuven, Director of Private Music Instruction, is excited about the soundproof practice rooms planned for the new building. VanLeuven confessed that she sometimes comes in to Prexy early in the morning when she needs to get work done. Even so, students wishing to play drums or rehearse with their jazz bands must come in after hours, and must compete for available slots. She admits, “I hate having to tell them they can’t play.”

“In some ways,” the limitations imposed by existing spaces are “good discipline,” remarks Virginia Hancock, Professor of Music, though she is excited to move into a space where the chorus will not be cramped in their risers. Associate Professor of Dance Carla Mann likens the current situation of arts facilities to a student learning chemistry in a kitchen: Though the student can create basic chemical reactions with ordinary supplies like baking soda, they can do much more in a laboratory. “Reed students do great things with nothing,” says Mann, “so I’m excited to see what they can do when they actually have stuff.”

The building will also serve as an _Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant_ entrance to the campus from the west, and will be an attractive venue for professional performing artists. Bringing in regional artists is an important aspect of dance instruction, especially in a small department. VanLeuven points out that the facilities can also serve as a warm-up space for artists performing in Kaul.

Kate Bredeson, Assistant Professor of Theatre hopes that the new building will “raise the profile of the arts as an intellectual discipline.” She believes that the marginalization of the arts is not a new problem, but one that has been around since Plato’s decree against drama in _The Republic_. Bredeson hopes that the new building can bring the arts under the spotlight by serving as a hub for the whole campus, and also become a place for people from greater Portland to go to see performances.

A stronger arts program may also attract more students to Reed: Mann gives the example of a biology major who may also be a dancer, and is “dismayed with the current facilities.” The department cannot offer evening classes, in which many students have expressed interest in, since the space used for classes in the Sports Center has other demands on it.

The building has been planned with future changes in mind. The infrastructure has been laid in place to enable adaptation to changes in technology. There is also extra office space, should there be an increase in the size of the faculty.
