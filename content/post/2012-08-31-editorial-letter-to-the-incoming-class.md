Dear New Freshmen,

    &#8220;While Socrates was an excellent ancient philosopher, he would make a terrible Reedie.&#8221;

Coming as new students to Reed, you&#8217;ve doubtless already heard hundreds of versions of the liberal arts college ethos: Question everything. Never accept received dogma. Soon, you&#8217;ll be in Hum110 learning about Socrates, who showed people in ancient Greece that everything they believed was actually not based in sound wisdom. In a world full of weak thinkers who too easily said “yes,” Socrates had the intelligence and courage to say “no.”

But Reed is filled with people who are exceptionally smart, and know it. Reedies know how to say “no.” In a pair of (albeit somewhat unscientific) polls conducted last year by the Quest, Reedies were highly cynical about Student Body Senate and about the Quest, with approval ratings for both entities somewhere around 20%. Reedies are quick to criticize everything from the administration to campus events to their readings for conference.

A healthy dose of cynicism is necessary. But in Reed&#8217;s critically thinking culture, cynicism too often transforms into inaction, and finally into apathy. If the stupid person&#8217;s flaw is that he is too quick to say “yes,” the smart person&#8217;s flaw is that he is too eager to say “no.”

So, new Reedies, challenge yourselves to find something here that you believe in, and stand up for it. Start by being cynical, but don&#8217;t end there. Look Socrates in the eye and say, “I know I can&#8217;t prove what I&#8217;m saying is right – nobody can prove anything for sure. But I&#8217;m going to believe it anyway.” Saying why an idea is wrong – or why an artistic endeavor is flawed, or why taking action doesn&#8217;t matter – is easy. What&#8217;s going to be hard is to defend something you&#8217;re passionate about. Whether it&#8217;s Student Body politics, journalism, arts, or anything else, have the courage to say “yes.”
