_Espresso drink prices rise $0.25_

The Paradox Cafe, Reed’s in-house coffeeshop, has been forced to raise blended coffee prices for the first time in years as the result of recent increased price rates in the coffee industry. Effective November 10th, espresso drinks (espressos, americanos, macchiatos, lattes, and mochas) will cost 25 cents more. Stumptown Coffee Roasters, the providers of the Paradox’s coffee, notified Paradox management that recent events in world coffee trade have made a change in prices mandatory.

“Stumptown’s been super cool about [the price changes]. They called us to explain what was going on and give us the background,” says Hannah Simonson ‘11, Paradox manager, further clarifying that the combination of environmental factors and governmental constraints are the primary source of price changes.

“Ethiopian trade restrictions have significantly impacted the market,” says Simonson. “The increased scarcity of coffee has driven prices up. Everyone’s been affected &#8211; even places like Starbucks.”

The Paradox has not had to change prices at all for the past three or four years, but Simonson isn’t worried that the new increase will affect the cafe’s finances.

“Most of our business is drip coffee, and those prices are the same,” says Simonson, adding that she’s “still proud of our prices. They’re at least comparable, if not cheaper, than other Stumptown distributors in Portland. It’s unfortunate that prices are going up, but it’s an issue that people are going to have to deal with on a much larger scale &#8211; in the greater Portland area, the entire country, the world. These things are constantly fluctuating, so for the sake of the environment and the economy, I hope the prices don’t change again for a while!&#8221;
