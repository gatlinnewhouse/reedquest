On Saturday, dozens of members of the Reed community equipped with machetes, pruners, and shovels assaulted an impenetrable swathe of invasive blackberries on the East side of the Canyon. From nine to six, volunteers resurfaced trails, planted native plants, and grappled with blackberry canes, among other nonnatives like clematis and English ivy, sometimes more than a dozen feet long. “This is the most pain I’ve experienced at an event I’ve enjoyed in a while,” said one student. The sun shone on an increasingly massive mound of organic matter tens of feet long and over six feet high. A bike-powered cider press; live banjo, guitar, and saxophone; and food provided by Ladies Pie Society, Cookies for All, and CAVE sustained weeders throughout the day.

“Canyon Day is a great way for us to come together,” said Zac Perry, Canyon Specialist. As Reed’s oldest tradition, Canyon Day has changed considerably since its inception. Before the restoration of the Canyon in 1999, as much organic matter as possible was cleared once a year by staff and burned to control invasives. One can still find layers of carbon in the soil.

Immediately following the restoration, Canyon Day transformed into a day-long, work-‘til-you-drop operation unaccompanied by live music and food, and with little coordination between volunteers. Over the past twelve years, it has become an increasingly collaborative effort between students and members of the extended Reed family. “More and more groups get involved every year,” Perry said. “Everyone has skills to bring to the table.” Canyon Day is, according to Perry, a celebration that fosters community and stewardship.

Nonnative species can have a devastating affect on the landscape. Clematis vines can climb a mature tree in a year, depriving them of sunlight and ultimately killing them. Himalayan blackberries smother native undergrowth, are spread by birds, and must be removed at the roots. Even ornamental trees planted around campus can seed and cause problems. Hawthorn trees and English ivy, both invasives present in the Canyon, were originally used for landscaping and erosion control.

Reed neighbors were among those most eagerly prying up the roots of nonnative species. “Anyone can enjoy the Canyon,” said Alicia King, who lives two blocks away from campus, “so it’s great that anyone can come help.”

“I walk my dog in the canyon every day,” said one volunteer.

“And every day I tell him to keep his dog on a leash,” Perry joked.

But Perry is quick to emphasize the importance of Canyon Day, as well. “It would take me two months to do what gets done in six hours,” he said. “Before, we did not come close to touching the tip of the iceberg. Now, we’re swimming, not sinking&#8221;
