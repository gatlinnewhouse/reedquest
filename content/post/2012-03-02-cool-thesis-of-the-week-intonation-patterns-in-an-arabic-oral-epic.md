“No, it&#8217;s not _this_ one; it&#8217;s _that_ one.” “It&#8217;s actually _not_ the way I thought.” When we speak English, we rely on rhythm, speed, and intonation to convey the difference between new and given intonation, giving extra weight to words that convey previously unknown facts. Though this may seem elemental to English speakers, it is actually not universal to all languages, says Elena Fernandez-Collins &#8217;12, of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.

“Egyptian Arabic does not have that” in everyday speech, Elena explains. In her thesis, “Intonation Patterns in the Sirat Bani Hilal, an Arabic Oral Epic,” which she is writing with professor of Linguistics Kara Becker, Elena is investigating whether this is true as well of spoken Arabic in the context of oral epic poetry. She is analyzing a recorded version of the _Sirat Bani Hilal,_ the last surviving Arabic oral epic. The _Sirat Bani Hilal,_ says Elena, __is “an embellished history of the Banu Hilal tribe migrating into Egypt and across North Africa into Morocco, conquering everything along the way,” but ultimately getting conquered themselves.

> “There may be a deeper connection between English and Arabic, a fundamental commonality the languages share.”

The poem, like _The Odyssey_ and _The Iliad_ would have been, is performed differently every time, using different language and focusing on different plot elements. “The epic itself never has a definite length,” Elena says, but at its longest, it “can span hundreds of hours.” The epic alternates between poetic passages, with are sung and accompanied by multiple instruments, and prose passages with less instrumentation, often just a spiked fiddle that is played to indicate the completion of a thought or a transition.

Elena is using a software called Prosody—also the name name of the general study of speech intonation—to analyze speech patterns in these prose sections. With the software, Elena says, “you can identify certain patterns that go with certain phrases or meanings.” Though Elena does not speak Arabic—though she plans to learn—she can use “hundreds and hundreds of pages of [translated] transcripts” to match passages with their corresponding sections in the recording. Then, she labels sections of prose by narrative structure, differentiating between sequences with high action—like her favorite, in which the Oddyssian hero Abu Zayd kills two of his teachers—and more relaxed ones. By categorizing each “area of interest” in the prose, Elena hopes to find “particular pitch patterns that match up to that category.” Overall, she will be looking to “see if they use intonation to inform the narrative.”

Elena says it is an excellent opportunity to spend her senior year working on the epic. “I have always been really really into folktales and fairytales and mythologies of different civilizations and cultures,” as well as linguistics, she says, so she is “excited” to “combine these two.” She has not yet determined if there is indeed a pattern of spoken intonation that correlates with meaning in the epics. However, if she did, it would imply a deeper connection between English and Arabic, a fundamental commonality the languages share.
