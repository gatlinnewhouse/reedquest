  <span class="s2"><span class="s2"><em>The Quest</em> has been in contact with those responsible for the recent “surveillance posters” that have attracted recent attention. They have made the following statement for publication</span><span class="s2">. </span></span>
</p>

<p class="s4" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
  <span class="s2">“The posters were designed by myself and my associate. We drew from the imagery of barbed wire, prisons, and surveillance and paired these photographs with slogans communicating the need for security, protection, and barriers in our dear community.</span>
</p>

<p class="s4" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
  <span class="s2">We believe that Reed College is a very special place. Unfortunately, the outside world is an </span><span class="s2">often hostile environment. We fear that this hostility may be quickly spilling into our community. This necessitates the establishment of borders, both physical and abstract, in order to protect our integrity and honor. <s></s></span>
</p>

<p class="s4" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
  <span class="s2">These posters are part of a public relations campaign meant to foster awareness of the numerous threats which are faced by our community. Through the regulation of persons entering our campus, we can protect against the many evils that lurk just beyond The Bubble. This tactic is proven to be effective in eliminating issues concerning terrorism, narcotics smuggling, and other campus safety matters; alien admissibility; contraband including child pornography, monetary instruments, and information in violation of copyright or trademark laws; and evidence of embargo violations or other import or export control laws. It is our hope that people will derive a strong sense of safety and community from these posters, but also an understanding of the </span><span class="s2">urgency which</span><span class="s2"> surrounds these matters.</span>
</p>

<p class="s4" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
  <span class="s2">Essentially, this is a precursor to the forthcoming Border Division of Safety Management (BDSM). The primary mission of BDSM is to protect our Campus by reducing the likelihood that dangerous people and capabilities enter the Reed College between ports of entry. This is accomplished by maintaining surveillance, following up on leads, responding to electronic sensor alarms and vehicle sightings, and interpreting and following tracks. Some of the major activities include maintaining checkpoints along pathways leading from border areas.</span>

<p class="s4" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
  <span class="s2">Often, the border is a barely discernible line in the uninhabited Canyon, lawns, and parking lots that comprise the campus. BDSM utilizes a variety of equipment and methods to accomplish its mission in such diverse terrain and to make these borders more apparent.”</span>
