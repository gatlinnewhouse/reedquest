On Tuesday evening, students packed into a classroom on the lower level of Vollum for a lecture by Dr. David Campion, Associate Professor in the History Department at Lewis and Clark College. The event, sponsored by the Reed Association for South Asia (RASA), featured a talk by Dr. Campion titled “India: From Colonial Crown Jewel to Democratic Superpower?” with food catered by local Indian restaurant Namaste Indian Cuisine.

Not content with Bollywood glitz as the prevalent representation of South Asia, freshmen Archit Basu Guha-Choudhury, Shruti Korada and Maha Pasha formed RASA to celebrate the full diversity of the cultures of the subcontinent.

Unlike ALANA Studies, RASA appears to have less of a decidedly academic orientation. There are plans for a larger Eid celebration next year, and a holi celebration during Renn Fayre (think water fight, but with color).
  
Interestingly, the first event put together by RASA was a screening of the Indian film Omkara. A gritty adaptation of Shakespeare’s Othello for modern day India, Omkara challenges Bollywood stereotypes by portraying the reality of caste-based society in rural India through the form of Western tragedy. What better way to overcome Bollywood but Bollywood itself?
