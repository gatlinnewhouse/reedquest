**Q:** Hey, Tristan, So my straight male friend, a pretty confident, good-looking guy without really any problem getting girls, came out to me the other day as having a giantess fetish. He loves looking up these photoshopped photos of super tall women walking all over cities like Godzilla or lifting up men in their fingers. I&#8217;ve got no problem with it, I&#8217;m just wondering, what the hell is behind this fetish?¬† What&#8217;s the deal? Are there other fetishes like this?

**A:** I think your buddy‚Äôs the only one who can answer the question as to what‚Äôs ‚Äúbehind‚Äù his fetish. Freud might have something to say too, but one can never tell how useful that information‚Äôs gonna be. The deal, as I understand fetishes, is that humans can be turned on by the strangest of things; almost anything really. If you look up the Wikipedia page on fetishes, there‚Äôs no end to the list, from Formicophilia (being crawled on by insects) to Macrophilia (the Latinate for your buddy‚Äôs paraphilia). I‚Äôve heard before that the latter usually has an association with a longing to be crushed by the giantess.
  
It sounds to me like this is one of the healthier fetishes to have. There are plenty of disturbing paraphilias (the DSM-IV‚Äôs name for a fetish) that cause insanely anti-social or even psychotic behavior such as Pedophilia or Erotophonophilia (murder). Let your bro do his thing‚Äîsounds as harmless as a foot fetish or [consensual] voyeurism.

**Q:** So there&#8217;s this chick. She&#8217;s real hot, I know she&#8217;s into the ladies, and she&#8217;s made it clear she&#8217;s interested in me. I&#8217;m by no means entirely inexperienced but I still think of myself as a virgin (kind of, more or less). Even if it&#8217;s unlikely to be an issue, is this the kind of thing I should tell her before we&#8217;re naked?
  
**A:** If you want‚Äîshe‚Äôs probably going to find out anyway, unless she‚Äôs as inexperienced as you are, in which case you should still bring it up, because then you‚Äôll both have a sigh of relief. Have fun üôÇ

&nbsp;

**Q:** I&#8217;m the only one in my group of friends who is still a virgin. I&#8217;m a little embarrassed about it and I just feel so left out when my friends talk about their hookups and whatnot. It sucks even more when they talk about problems with love lives and I can&#8217;t help but feel bitter and think, &#8220;Well, at least you have someone interested in you.&#8221; The lack of people interested in me makes me feel so insecure and uncomfortable about my body. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s anything I can do about this.

**A:** There is absolutely no reason to feel embarrassed üôÇ You‚Äôll make your sexual debut when and where you want to. The more you think about it and the more your friends talk about it, the worse it feels and that sucks, but there are always ways you can improve your situation. One way might be finding some friends who are a little more sensitive to your insecurities, but that‚Äôs usually pretty damn difficult, so I think you might as well be absolutely open about the fact that you haven‚Äôt had sex. If you‚Äôre open about it and your friends are good friends, they‚Äôll totally help you out with this. The more you trust people, the more likely they are to trust you. If people aren‚Äôt interested in you, you might take a moment to make a list of all the things that make you awesome. I‚Äôm completely serious about this. Appreciate these points and do what you can to embrace those aspects of yourself (helps fight insecurity and make you more confident and that looks attractive on anyone). The thing is, you can‚Äôt force people to be interested in you, but you can decide to be an interesting person. Find your passions, your favorite activities, and focus on pushing yourself to excel in those areas. To use an analogy from ‚ÄúField of Dreams‚Äù: ‚ÄúIf you build it, they will come.‚Äù If you do cool stuff and be a cool, confident person‚Äîyou‚Äôll turn some heads. Don‚Äôt expect results, do these things for yourself‚Äînot to attract others. Attracting others is just a symptom of having made yourself an awesome life. It might take a while, but when someone asks you what you‚Äôre into, you‚Äôll have an answer and that one random conversation might lead to someone being intensely interested in you.

&nbsp;

**Q:** I recently started seeing this girl, and I dig her quite a bit. I have been refraining from having sex with her because I wanted it to be more than a hook up (she&#8217;s something else). Is this a good idea, or should I cave in? I am a guy who digs chivalry, but she really wants to have sex. I do too, but I don&#8217;t want to fuck it up.

**A:** By all means, _fuck it up._ If it‚Äôs what she wants and it‚Äôs what you want, please do it. As soon as humanly possible. I know you may have some reservations about actually fucking up your relationship with this girl by adding sex to the mix before the platonic end of things has fully blossomed, but honestly, sex will not be what fucks that up, it will be you prioritizing sex above the platonic friendship you have with her. This, in itself, is not all bad, as long as it is not the sole pillar upon which your relationship stands from here on out. Allow sex to take you both away from all sense for a goodly amount of time. If you‚Äôre really good together, then the platonic stuff will still be there when you both eventually leave each others‚Äô pants for more than a day. Good luck! Get laid!

&nbsp;

**Q:** Okay so right now I&#8217;m in an open long-distance relationship. The whole, physically open, emotionally closed type deal, or that&#8217;s the idea I guess. And I know that I can handle fucking without feeling TOO much, but I don&#8217;t know if my partner can. I get so worried and jealous that one of their flings will turn into a thing and they&#8217;ll find someone better than me. I know it seems stupid, but I can&#8217;t really help it. Any advice on dealing with this jealousy/situation?

**A:** Oh man, distance is always such a nuisance, always getting between people. I feel for you, man. The thing is, if your partner falls for someone that‚Äôs not you, then that is their choice and they‚Äôre doing what‚Äôs best for them romantically. So, you have a couple choices‚Äîyou could A: worry (which doesn‚Äôt do anyone much good), B: try and control their sexual behavior (which will restrict their freedom and possibly result in much unhappiness), or C: realize that you are an amazing person, that you have a good connection with your partner, and that if they find something better than what you‚Äôve already got, then be happy for them and continue to live your life without regret of having been close to someone. That may not alleviate your worries, but it‚Äôs what you‚Äôve got to work with. I know for sure that the more you worry about it, the more likely you are to start jealous fighting, and that kind of stuff is hard to patch when you‚Äôre both miles away.
