Much of the material academics study is the product of the elite. But Max Maller &#8217;13 seeks to study an art form that rose out of the lower echelons of 19th Century China. His Chinese thesis, which he is working on with Professor Hyong Rhew, explores the art and evolution of Xiangsheng, a popular form of comedy in China that originated in the markets and temple fairs of Beijing during the Qing Dynasty. Max, of Burlingame, California, spent his sophomore year in China, where he discovered that &#8220;Xiangsheng is probably the most popular form of traditional Chinese entertainment right now.&#8221;

Max explains that Xiangsheng always takes the same form: Two men stand on a stage. One man, dressed in a blue robe and carrying a fan, plays the &#8220;Dougen,&#8221; which Max translates as &#8220;joker&#8221; or lead comedian. The other man, the &#8220;Penngen,&#8221; is serious. &#8220;The comedian will start to tell a story and talk about the origins of some practice or word,&#8221; Max explains. &#8220;It will be an everyday conversation–but then he&#8217;ll say something that doesn&#8217;t sound quite right.&#8221; When the serious man says something about it, the comedian tries to give an explanation for his strange comment, but, Max says, &#8220;the explanation will come totally out of left field. And the explanation is always funny; it&#8217;s always really fucking funny.&#8221;

In one piece, for example, the Dougen stands at a podium and says, &#8220;Being a performer isn&#8217;t easy. You have to be able to speak.&#8221; The Penggen will then point out that everyone speaks. &#8220;Speaking and speaking are not the same thing,&#8221; explains the Dougen, who begins doing &#8220;tongue gymnastics&#8221; by reciting long tongue twisters fraught with Chinese puns.

Xiangsheng was originally performed by poorer Chinese people in marketplaces or temple fairs. &#8220;It was never an art form that received favor from the emperor,&#8221; Max says. However, a large part of Max&#8217;s thesis is devoted to Hou Baolin, a Chinese comedian who transformed Xiangsheng from a &#8220;poor&#8221; form of art, only accessible to people who spoke the dialect, into a widespread form of comedy by removing the &#8220;local elements&#8221; of the performance. &#8220;Baolin stripped the Beijing dialect and replaced it with a linguistic palate that people all over China could understand,&#8221; Max says.

Baolin&#8217;s development of the more accessible version of Xiangsheng coincided with another important evolution in China. &#8220;The Liberation had just happened,&#8221; Max explains, &#8220;and lower forms of art received a lot of support.&#8221; Baolin himself performed over a hundred times for Chairman Mao, who had his own favorite pieces.

But because of the art’s popularity and value as a symbol of proletarian glory, Mao&#8217;s communist government soon co-opted Xiangsheng and used it to educate the masses. Xiangsheng soon became a tool to teach people Mandarin and to propagate socialist values. Explains Max, &#8220;The new socialist pieces used tongue twisters to lay out socialist values in ways that weren&#8217;t so artful.&#8221;

Xiangsheng&#8217;s use as a socialist tool is ironic in that its performers, who had been glorified for being lower-class, became rich and famous; meanwhile, the comedians lost their artistic agency. &#8220;Before, when people were poor, [Xiangsheng] flowed and developed in an artistic way. But when they were famous, they had to perform these pieces that weren&#8217;t written by them,&#8221; says Max.

Today, Xiangsheng looks more like it did pre-Communism. &#8220;People went back and rediscovered the old repertoire, and the traditional pieces have come back into use,&#8221; Max says. &#8220;Now it appeals to everyone – from poor people who can&#8217;t read to students, professionals, the old the young. They take old recordings of Xiangsheng and splice it in with cartoons. Taxi drivers play it on the radio.&#8221;
