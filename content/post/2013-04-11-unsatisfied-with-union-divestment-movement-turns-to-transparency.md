Unsatisfied with last month’s [Reed Union on climate change][1] and denied a list of the college’s investment managers by the Board of Trustees Investment Committee, [Fossil Free Reed][2], Reed’s nascent divestment movement, has set its sights on a new target. Before the group, spearheaded by members of Greenboard and founded as part of [350.org][3]’s national college divestment campaign, can make a strong case for divestment from fossil fuel companies, it needs information. Now, Fossil Free Reed is demanding transparency from the Investment Committee as the first step in its larger campaign to persuade the college to divest the endowment from [200 fossil fuel companies.][4]

Shannon Smith ’14, one student at the forefront of Fossil Free Reed, says that Vice President and Treasurer Ed McFarlane initially offered to give the group a list of the 60 investment managers with which Reed invests its endowment, but has since reneged. “Ed McFarlane has retracted his offer to share with me the list of Reed&#8217;s investment managers,” Smith says. “I think that transparency is the first step towards a sensible investment policy—ideally one that does not support industries that are profiting on the destruction of the climate.”

McFarlane says this tension rose in part out of a miscommunication. “I apparently was not sufficiently clear about the process of providing a list of Reed&#8217;s investment managers. I thought I had made it clear that the release of such information would need to be approved by the Investment Committee. I apologize for my lack of clarity.”

The trustees will be on campus April 11 and 12. Fossil Free Reed hopes they can find out why the Investment Committee is refusing to release a list of Reed’s investment managers.

According to Appendix C of Reed’s [Investment Responsibility Policy][5]{.broken_link}, Smith says, the Investment Committee must vote on requests to alter the endowment for “non-economic” reasons. “While I disagree that [divesting in fossil fuels] is ‘non-economic,’ I recognize that they characterize it as such, and so they should follow their own guidelines and vote on the issue before denying it,” Smith says. “So right now we are issuing a written request that they do so. If they vote no on the request to divest the endowment from fossil fuels, we will then register an appeal and an ad hoc review committee of at least three Board of Trustee members will form to discuss it further.”

**Dissatisfaction with the Union**

Smith says the Union of March 13 failed to adequately address the issue of divestment. “I was disappointed with the scope and format of the Reed Union on Climate Change. There was no dialogue whatsoever.” Specifically, Smith criticizes McFarlane for his articulating Reed’s investment policy. “Ed McFarlane, who was clearly in attendance only in order to give Reed&#8217;s official stance on divestment, stood up and did just that. He frankly stated that the primary goal of the investment policy promote academic freedom and that for this reason Reed does not invest due to political issues,” Smith says. “Climate change is kinda different from a partisan political issue.”

McFarlane emphasizes that he was only relaying the college’s policy, not expressing his own opinion. “I do not believe I expressed an opinion at the Reed Union on this issue,” he says. “I thought I made it clear that I was not expressing an opinion, but was providing information on what the college&#8217;s policy is on taking a stand on political issues.” McFarlane said at the Union that the real debate is whether divesting from fossil fuels is truly a political issue—the implication being that if the community decided that divestment transcended politics, the Investment Committee might consider it.

Whether divestment from fossil fuels is a political or moral issue lies at the heart of the divestment debate. Fossil Free Reed says that divestment transcends politics, that it is a moral issue.

McFarlane says the community needs to discuss that assumption. “Some people would classify, for example, alcohol produces a moral issue, or tobacco is a moral issue. Is it? I don’t know,” McFarlane says. “Are they moral issues? Or are they not moral issues? There’s gotta be a debate, right. Obviously the Catholic Church defines some things as a moral issue, and do we accept that as the definition of a moral issue? Birth control is a moral issue. Is it?”

Though the college has a policy of not making investments for political reasons, Reed does only invest with firms that abide by the Sullivan Principles, a corporate code of conduct formulated by American Reverend Leon Sullivan in 1977 during South African Apartheid.

One student, who prefers to remain anonymous, criticizes the Union for having a panel of three untenured faculty (Chemistry Professor Julie Fry, History Professor Joshua Howe, and Political Science Professor Chris Koski) speak before the Vice President and Treasurer of the college. “It was ridiculous for the Reed Union to have a panel of untenured faculty in front of the college&#8217;s vice president and treasurer,” the student says. “They might have been intimidated to speak up. It runs counter to the goals of a Reed Union when no one can talk freely about the issues.”

The student says that the [Faculty Constitution][6] may also have been a factor in the panel’s faculty’s silence on divestment. While Article V of the Faculty Constitution and Bylaws provides “that each faculty member has individual freedom of inquiry and expression,” in Section 2 of the same article, the Constitution states, “When a faculty member speaks, writes, or acts as a citizen, he or she shall be free from institutional censorship or discipline, and he or she should undertake to avoid any implication that he or she is speaking on behalf of the institution.’”

McFarlane disagrees with this student’s assessment. “I do not think Article V nor my presence silenced the faculty panel at the Reed Union. My experience with Reed faculty is that they are quite willing to speak up.”

**A Primer on the Endowment**

Reed’s endowment of about $456 million is overseen by the Investment Committee of the Board of Trustees. The committee, composed of five trustees with investing experience, works with an outside consultant, a practice typical of college investment committees. The chairman of the Board, Vice President and Treasurer of the college Ed McFarlane, and President John Kroger are also _ex officio_ (by virtue of the offices they respectively hold) members of the committee.

When deciding how to invest the endowment, the committee first moves through the process of asset allocation. During asset allocation, the committee decides what percentage of the endowment to invest in real estate, how much to invest in foreign equity, how much to invest in American bonds, and so on. By maintaining a diverse portfolio, the committee aims to protect the endowment from market fluctuations as much as possible.

Not all colleges manage their endowments in the same way. Harvard’s endowment is so large that the college maintains its own in-house investment firm, Harvard Management Company. Yale’s approach is more similar to Reed’s: rather than make its own investments, it instead decides with which managers it wants to entrust its funds. Because of its size, however, Yale has many more staff dedicated to making investment decisions—22 staff involved directly in investment and four legal counsel—than Reed does. Next to McFarlane, only one more staff person, Financial Analyst Andrew Lonergan, is responsible for overseeing Reed’s endowment. “This is pretty common for our type of institution, to have trustee investment committee, couple of staff that carry out the assignments, and almost everybody has a professional consultant outside that they hire,” McFarlane says.

“We’re lucky. We have a pretty sophisticated investment committee, I would say, given the type of school that Reed is, right, there are no business programs here or anything like that,” Lonergan says. “It seems to be changing, I think, but in the past, anyway, not a lot of people, not a lot of Reedies, went to work on Wall Street, so you wouldn’t actually have this constituency from which you could draw to serve on the Board of Trustees.” Trustees serving on the committee are chosen for their expertise. “You want people who are very knowledgeable of how this whole investment world works,” says McFarlane.

After going through the process of asset allocation, the Investment Committee decides which investment managers it wants to use. In total, Reed’s endowment is split among 60 investment managers. “We’re always looking for managers, at different managers,” McFarlane says. Reed’s trustees and the committee’s outside consultant have connections on Wall Street that can help the college get a foot in the door of sought-after managers. The committee tries to invest with the best managers it can find while also adhering to its asset allocation plan. For example, if the committee wants to invest two percent of the endowment with a manager who specializes in real estate because it likes that manager, it might be limited by their earlier decision to only invest one percent of the endowment in real estate.

In 2011, _The Portland Business Journal_ [reported][7] that “roughly 44 percent” of Reed’s endowment is invested in hedge funds. When many people hear “hedge fund,” they think of Bernie Madoff’s multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme or Wall Street businessmen snorting lines of coke off glass tables in Manhattan penthouses.

But McFarlane says that hedge funds aren’t necessarily defined by high risk, high stress cultures. “The whole term ‘Hedge Fund’ is misinterpreted, I guess, a lot. It’s more a legal structure than it is an investment style.” Reed has a long history of investing in hedge funds because Walter Mintz ’50, onetime chairman of the Board of Trustees, ran a hedge fund in the ‘80s. Back then, hedge funds were far more limited in scope, McFarlane says. “The original concept of a hedge fund was more of a style, but it was all equities, it was a long-short type of thing, it was a hedging your bets type of situation, if you will.”

Now, hedge fund managers can specialize in anything and everything. “Now, we call it absolute return, which is a misnomer, but the idea is that under all circumstances, whether the markets are going up or the markets are doing down, you’re going to make money,” Lonergan says.

Rather than decide to invest a certain percentage of the endowment in hedge funds, the Investment Committee makes decisions based on what those managers are investing in. Because many hedge funds are run by top investors who have left financial titans and struck out on their own, hedge fund managers are in high demand.

The world of investing has changed radically since the college began investing in hedge funds in the ‘80s, McFarlane says. Now, many more styles of investment make it difficult to determine what an investment manager is invested in at any given time. “That time, you were basically invested in U.S. stocks or bonds, and that was about it. It wasn’t a global world,” says McFarlane. While the college does adhere to the Sullivan Principles, the opacity of today’s investments make it extremely difficult for institutions to extricate themselves from sectors, like the energy sector, or even parts of sectors, like fossil fuel companies.

Lonergan says that divestment would limit the college’s investment options, making the endowment more volatile. “You would end up with a riskier portfolio, in the end, too, probably, because you’d end up with a more concentrated portfolio,” he says. Asking a manager to avoid investing in fossil fuels is a dubious proposition, as well. Hedge fund managers seldom take instruction from their clients. “A hedge fund manager would probably just tell you to take a hike. They don’t have the time to butt around.”

Unity College in Maine, which claims to be the first college in the nation that has divested from fossil fuels, may actually be invested indirectly in fossil fuels as you read this article. By investing in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, Unity says no more than one percent of its endowment will ever be invested in fossil fuel companies at a given time.

But Reed is not directly invested in fossil fuels either. None of the holdings of Reed’s 60 investment managers are held in the college’s name. Unity’s “divestment” raises the question, “How much divestment is divestment?”

Further, were Reed to divest from fossil fuel companies, it would inevitably wind up investing in consumers of fossil fuels instead. “They’re looking mainly at companies that are putting holes in the ground and pulling something out of them,” McFarlane says of the larger national divestment movement. “They’re not worried about, in the end, the pipeline that gets it from here to here or the refinery that uses it over here or the manufacturer that uses it over here, or the shipping company that burns it, or the airline company that burns it.”
