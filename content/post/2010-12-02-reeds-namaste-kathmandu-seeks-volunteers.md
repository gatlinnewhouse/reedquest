Ten-year-old Asmita wanted to go to school, but her mother couldn’t afford to continue sending her.

At the local private school, tuition was free, but books and supplies were not. Asmita, a bright little girl with pigtails and a huge smile loved school more than anything else. She wore her uniform even on days off. At age nine, she had already read through half of her science book by teaching herself at home. Forced to drop out at age ten, Asmita came to my second grade classroom in an urban slum in Kathmandu, Nepal and asked to join. We gladly admitted her.

Asmita’s feet dangled off the bench as she put her pencil to her lips and studied the math problem in front of her. We had only just begun to teach the rest of the class the concept of multiplication, but Asmita already understood it. She turned to her new friend Alisa, read her work, and told her she was incorrect. She showed her how to count on her fingers to find the correct answer. The wind changed direction, sending a cloud of sand blasting from the dirt road and into the awning-covered outdoor classroom. All of the children ducked their heads down away from the cloud of sand. When the wind subsided, Asmita picked up her head, held her notebook in the air and said “Miss! Finished! Look!”

As a volunteer teacher in Kathmandu, Nepal, at Mechi Mahakali School built by Portland-based non-profit Namaste Kathmandu, I enjoyed working with Asmita and many other children in the classroom. While many of Asmita’s peers had not received any formal education prior to attending Mechi Mahakali School, Asmita knew how to sit still in class, follow directions, and raise her hand.

Even in a traditional school setting, she had out-performed children her age. When I gave homework, she finished double the amount assigned, came in the next day, and complained that the book was “too easy.” I taught her the beginning of double-digit multiplication, and she figured out the rest on her own.

Since 2008, non-profit Namaste Kathmandu has worked tirelessly to provide free and quality educational opportunity to children like Asmita in urban slums. Many of the children are malnourished and have to miss school to earn money or care for family members. In addition to free education, the school also provides free supplies, uniform, and lunch six days a week. Today 50 children ages 18 months through 14 years are able to make their dream of going to school a reality.

As of November 2010, the school anticipates at least 10 additional students in the coming month, a large increase since the small class of 12 back in 2008.

In the wake of the Nepalese Civil War, thousands of people fled small villages surrounding Kathmandu and came to the capital city in search of safety and employment. Most were part of the dalit minority, the lowest rung of the Hindu caste system. They set up shantytowns along the banks of the Baghmati, a once sacred but now polluted river. In efforts to “clean up” the city, police performed regular raids of shantytowns, burning down the bamboo-tarpaulin structures and leaving the impoverished people there completely helpless.

When Xeno Acharya ’08 arrived in Kathmandu, a group of migrants had recently relocated along the banks of the Baghmati River after being chased from a different site. He asked them what they felt would most help, and they decided that they needed a no-cost school for their children. Acharya gave them the money to build a school, using funds from his own fundraiser and the McGill Lawrence Internship Award. When the parents finished construction on the school, they decided to name their community.

The parents and other volunteers had been so diligent in building the school, they named themselves Paruki Gaun (“diligent village”). The school was named “Mechi Mahakali” in honor of the fact that families had migrated to this safe haven from all over the country: from the East (Mechi) to the West (Mahakali). Once homeless migrants had empowered themselves to build a school and in the process formed lasting bonds with one another.

When he started the project and began the non-profit Namaste Kathmandu, Acharya did not predict its success or growth. The mere physical presence of a permanent structure in Paruki Gaun Village has made a huge difference.  “This place that hadn’t been noticed before is actually being noticed,” says Acharya. The existence of Mechi Mahakali School, in what would otherwise look like a disparate grouping of one-room homes and tin-roof shacks, has attracted non-governmental organizations to the community. Such NGOs, aware that children in need attend the school and live in the community, work to offer a number of social services previously unavailable to the poor migrants.

What’s more, the construction of the concrete Mechi Mahakali School building has made families feel less afraid of future police raids and has allowed them to begin more permanent family homes.

Currently working towards his Master’s degree in Public Health, Acharya says he’s learned that “educating people is the first step in giving them better health.”

Here in Portland, Oregon, the non-profit Namaste Kathmandu (NK) works to provide the funds and organization necessary to run Mechi Mahakali School. With only a few dedicated members, Acharya says, “we are really stretched thin for the amount of work we have, we need people on board that will help us out over here.” Now NK invites Reed College students to join NK as part of “Reed NK Student Group.” Group members have the chance to volunteer for a summer in Paruki Gaun Village.

Joining NK would also mean getting an inside look at the process of starting and sustaining a non-profit. Activities in Portland would include helping to raise awareness through on-campus events, learning to design web pages, writing publicity materials, and raising funds to volunteer in Nepal.

Namaste Kathmandu will hold an event: “Come Change the World With Us” this Monday, Dec. 6th, at 6 p.m. in Eliot 314. We will show a brief movie and eat Nepali snacks. Xeno Acharya will speak, as well as Summer 2010 volunteers Erica Boulay and Kritish Rajbhandari. Even if you’re not interested in making a commitment to “Reed NK Student Group”, please come and learn about the work Reedies are doing in your community and around the world to empower children and their communities through education.
