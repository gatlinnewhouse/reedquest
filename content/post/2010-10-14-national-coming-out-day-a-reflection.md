Monday, October 11th, marked National Coming Out Day, but the gathering of over four hundred people organized by Pride Northwest in Pioneer Square was a somber event.

As my friend and I crossed the street, we heard a song of prayer about belonging across difference and, as we entered the crowd, we saw the glow of candles casting light on crying faces. A Sister of Perpetual Indulgence, dressed in the drag of a nun, complete with white face paint and glitter makeup, brushed away a tear from her false-lashed eyes as she lit our candles.

The Remembrance Vigil honored the lost lives of six young people who took their lives in reaction to the isolation, desperation, and hopelessness they felt in being confronted with homophobic and transphobic bullying in their schools and universities. These experiences were only made all the worse by the teachers and administrators who did little, if anything, to help them when they spoke out and reached for help.

The event specifically focused on the six youth whose suicides were covered in the mass media: Tyler Clemente, 18, New Jersey; Asher Brown, 13, Texas; Seth Walsh, 13, California; Billy Lucas, 15, Indiana; and Justin Aaberg, 15, Minnesota. In reality, there were twice as many victims of suicide during the month of September than recognized by the event’s officials: Caleb Nolt, 14, Indiana, Harrison Brown, 15, Colorado, Cody Barker, 17, Wisconsin, Raymond Chase, 17, Rhode Island, Felix Sacco, 17, Massachusetts. Their stories did not receive the same amount of press.

The most powerful moments of the night came from the reflections of queer and trans youth representatives from SMYRC, the Sexual Minority Youth Resource Center, GLSEN, the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, OutsideIn, and QPOWER, Queer Portlanders Organizing and Working for Equal Rights.

Youth leaders spoke of their experiences being taunted and bullied, of suicide attempts, of lost lives of friends, of coming out, of being kicked out, of the restorative power of community and chosen family, the meaning of that one friend or family member who made the difference.

Local politicians, including Mayor Sam Adams, Senator Ron Wyden, and a representative for Congressman Earl Blumenauer, as well as the executive director for Portland’s branch of the Human Rights Campaign spoke proudly of their efforts in the arenas of trying to achieve marriage equality and to repeal DADT because, they claimed, undignified inequalities such as these cause harm to queer youth and empower bullies. It was upsetting to see such groups and officials stake a claim as advocates for queer youth rather than accepting responsibility for the ways in which they have failed, as leaders of a social movement and as legislators, to play offense for LGBTQ youth for the last twenty years and thus are in part responsible for the lack of a social safety net.

Queer youth speakers were quick to point out that Oregon has the nation’s most stringent safe schools anti-bullying laws on the basis of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity because groups like QPOWER pushed the Legislature to do so in passing House Bill 2599. Still, today there remains a stunning lack of infrastructure for youth, citing the sole suicide hotline for GLBTQ youth, the Trevor Project (1-866-4-U-TREVOR).

Youth speakers challenged the community to stop waiting for the legislature, for civil rights groups to act on our behalf and to commit ourselves to action. They called on us to stand up for one another, to challenge bullying at its root. In order for things to get better, we need to make them better.

_The Portland community is invited to attend “We Are Here,” a community forum for LGBTQ youth to speak about their experiences, on Tuesday, October 19th, from 7:30-9:00 PM, at the Q Center at 4115 N Mississippi St., Portland._
