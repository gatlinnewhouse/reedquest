_A second essay by the Blue Heron Collective on the topic of gender-neutral restrooms_

**Jeff Hamada**

Hey Reed. It’s Blue Heron; maybe you saw our article in the Quest last week. Maybe you thought it was rad. Maybe you’re indifferent, confused, or even a little angry. Maybe you missed it and are now thoroughly confused. In any case, we’re writing this follow up to explain some points in our last article, clarify the problem as we see it, and lay out what we’d like to do and how we’d like to do it.

Let’s start at the top. If you’re reading this, there is a pretty damn high chance that at some time at Reed, you—student, staff, faculty, administrator, or guest—have used a public restroom. You approach its yawning doors and face a choice: left or right, male or female. Easy, right?

Actually, no. Not if your gender identity isn’t male or female. Not if you don’t appear to onlookers to be the gender you identify with. And not if you require assistance from someone of a different perceived gender than you. It’s common sense that there should be a restroom for everyone to use in whatever building they’re in, however, “male or female” doesn’t work for everyone. It’s a “good enough” solution at the expense of dignity for both Reedies and visitors to our community.

Unfortunately, the stakes are higher for the people who are excluded by gender binary spaces. People outside the bubble have been verbally assaulted, humiliated, and in several cases physically attacked by bystanders as well as authority figures like business owners and cops for “choosing wrong.”

Transphobia exists, but like all forms of oppression, it can be invisible. This is why we’re proposing that one restroom in every public building that has multiple restrooms become gender neutral.

We do not want to be the only voices on this issue and really, we couldn’t be if we tried. This is really a question of community standards and community norms. What we have done is written our last Quest article and gone before Senate to get support for the idea of gender-neutral restrooms in public spaces. We’d like to talk logistics with Phys Plant, have an event where we can discuss this issue as a community, and check where students, faculty, and staff are at on this issue through a poll, all the while keeping you informed of our progress. As Blue Heron, we encourage anyone to work with us on this or any other project, but we also encourage you to work on this on your own. Think of your own position, write a Quest article, start a group, organize.

We hope this article has clarified some of the questions you may have had about what we’re trying to do and why we’re trying to do it. We hope you’re with us, and we hope that in any case we can have a discussion as a community about this issue that affects all of us.

Love Reed. Hate the gender binary.
