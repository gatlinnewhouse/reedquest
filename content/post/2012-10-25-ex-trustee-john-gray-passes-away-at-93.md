John Gray, Reed trustee and husband of the late Betty Gray, with whom he founded the Gray Fund, passed away on October 18. He was 93 years old when he died of cancer.

Gray, a renowned Portland developer, sat on the Board of Trustees from 1961 to 2006, serving as chairman from 1967 to 1982. But his reach at Reed extended far beyond his duties as a trustee. “Arguably, there wouldn&#8217;t be a Reed College today if it hadn&#8217;t been for John Gray,” says Trustee John Sheehy ’82. “The leadership he provided as trustee chairman during the late 60s and early 70s, when the college was on the verge of bankruptcy and struggling for its life, is alone the stuff of Reed legend. There was one year during Reed&#8217;s nadir when Gray reportedly just paid off the college&#8217;s annual deficit.”

In an email to the Reed community, President John Kroger wrote of Gray’s importance to the well-being of Reed students, the college, and Portland as a whole. “John&#8217;s great contributions to Reed have previously been recognized by award of an honorary degree and the naming of the Gray Campus Center, which houses, among others things, Commons and Kaul Auditorium,” he wrote. “A true friend to Reed, John will be greatly missed.”

Gray’s legacy certainly lives on at Reed, where students continue to benefit from his and his wife’s altruism. “The focus of John&#8217;s own generosity, along with that of his wife Betty, was on upgrading the campus&#8217; architectural development and on improvements to student life,” Sheehy says. “The quality of the Reed experience today owes a great debt to John Gray.”

Memorial services for Gray will be announced as soon as information becomes available.
