Renn Fayre is nearly upon us, and while this may cause many to vibrate with excitement, the chaos of Renn Fayre is not something that might appeal to every person on campus. In order to better accommodate these students, the Office for Institutional Diversity and Student Services is offering up a couple of options for Alternative Renn Fayres that students can take part in.

“These Renn Fayre weekend excursions are an effort to provide an inclusive, celebratory space for students and staff to socialize and, in the spirit of Renn Fayre, to celebrate the culmination of another year at Reed,” Dayspring Mattole, Activities Coordinator at the Multicultural Resource Center, says. There are two options for those interested in taking part in an Alternative Renn Fayre, one that allows students to be off campus for nearly all of Renn Fayre, while the other incorporates both time on-campus and a respite away from the madness of the festivities.

The first option is a weekend trip to the central Oregon town of Sunriver. The group will depart after Thesis Parade on Friday and travel to a large house in that town. On Saturday, everyone will receive funds to pursue a number of fun activities, such as hiking, shopping, and yoga. At night, everyone will have an opportunity to bond with their fellow trippers over games, movies, and food back at the house. This trip will then head back to Reed mid-day on Sunday.

The other option is designed for people who want to experience Renn Fayre on campus, but also get off-campus at night, to get a breather from the bedlam of the festivities. In this Alternative Renn Fayre, a house in the Alberta Arts District in North Portland has been reserved for Friday and Saturday nights.  During the day, they can choose to come back to campus, or stay in the Alberta area and experience the sights and stores of that locale.

“Students might choose to sign up for these Renn Fayre activities for a variety of reasons, including a desire to be in a substance-free environment away from campus during the weekend, or interest in celebrating the weekend with a smaller group of friends,” Dayspring says. “We request that all participants respect the substance-free nature of these activities.”
