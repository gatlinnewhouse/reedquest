The number of post-docs in Biology, Phycology, and Chemistry at Reed increased over the past two years, but their presence remains largely unnoticed. There are currently four post-docs, and one more is expected to arrive by April.

At Reed, Post-docs act as liaisons between students and facility, especially in the realms of research. In contrast, post-docs in research universities primarily deal with pursuing their own research to develop skills needed for their profession. While at Reed, the post-doc experience is non-traditional, as greater interaction with undergrads creates a mentor-mentee relationship.

According to Biology Professor Sarah Schaack, &#8220;the goal of post-docs is to have a non-hierarchical interactive group where people with different backgrounds and perspectives can learn from each other about science and life. Post-docs are a very important part of that mix.&#8221;

Jeremy Coate ‘92, a Reed alumnus, is a post-doc working in Schaack&#8217;s lab. Coate wrote his thesis under David Dalton. After receiving his M.A. in Biology from Oregon State University, he joined the Peace Corps and worked on agroforestry projects with local farmers in The Gambia. He received his Ph.D. from Cornell, but when his wife got a job in Portland last year, the stars were aligned for his return to Reed.

Coate&#8217;s research looks at how genome duplication affects gene expression and how in turn that affects genome evolution. He says that one of his main jobs is &#8220;just helping Sarah&#8217;s lab to function well.&#8221; To assist in his research, Coate will have two students working for him this summer. The advent of post-docs at Reed offers more opportunities for students to get their hands dirty in real research.

Coate also offers Olde Reed history to students researching with him. He talks fondly about the kommie, leash-less dogs roaming campus, and the &#8220;more Bacchanalian&#8221; Renn Fayres of yesteryear. He recalls a story from his time playing rugby: &#8220;We were on a road trip to Idaho in an old mini-bus and we were doing stuff the entire ride over.” Unfortunately, no one paid very much attention to the fuel gauge. “Well, around midnight we run out of gas and our driver had to hitchhike to a gas station, get a can of gas, and hitchhike back. So we got to the station, but it was closed! So we siphoned gas out of the cars around town to get to the tournament.&#8221;

Leigh Latta is another post-doc working in Schaack’s lab. He grew up in Northeast Oregon and received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Oregon. He took five years off in the 90s to play bass in a band called Loom that played metal-fusion. But even before Latta came to Reed, Coate explains that a potent connection existed for the two post-docs. “He brewed for Terminal Gravity and I drink Terminal Gravity beer.&#8221; Latta is a knowledgeable brew-meister and left Terminal Gravity Brewing to earn a Ph.D. in Biology in 2010 from Utah State. Before returning to Portland, he was a post-doc at Harvard.

Latta investigates why species with broad ecological niches are displacing species with narrow niches. He is currently helping three students with research projects in the lab. He describes his job as &#8220;making it my business to quickly learn more than they know so I can be a resource.&#8221; He says with a smile, “You never want to be stumped by a student. It&#8217;s the worst, they just dogpile you.&#8221;

Latta lives by Johnson Creek and sometimes takes his daughters to catch crayfish. He gives sage advice to any food-loving Reedie: &#8220;you can tie a piece of bacon on a net and boom &#8211; ten crawdads.&#8221; Latta recalls doing research in the field. &#8220;After taking measurements, the professor would just throw all the crawdads into a pot and eat all of our research.&#8221; The Reedies who had Biology Professor Suzy Renn for Introductory Biology know that this is a common trend among professors.

Renn also has a post-doc in the lab. Etienne Bezault has been working in the Renn lab for the last two years. He researches &#8220;the relationship between genome-wide gene duplicate number and evolutionary adaptive radiation.&#8221; He hails from France and received his undergrad from l’Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in Paris and received his Ph.D. from l’Université Paris-Sud. Afterwards, he was a post-doc at the University of Bern where he first started to study cichlids. Bezault was in the same school of cichlid researchers as Renn, so when the opportunity opened up to come to Reed, he came to Portland.

Like Latta and Coate, Bezault is a family man and enjoys the culture of the Pacific Northwest. &#8220;People here are much more relaxed. It&#8217;s nice to be able to go outside and go hiking or to go out and see a basketball game.&#8221; He finds it funny that people always ask why he would ever want to leave Paris, but he finally found a t-shirt that can explain. It reads: &#8220;Portland. Because Paris is too expensive.&#8221; Though he appreciates the regional beer and even found a good bakery, Bezault has one gripe: the coffee. The espresso is too bitter and the drip is too weak, he explains: &#8220;It could use some improvement, but everything else here, I&#8217;m impressed.&#8221;

Before coming to Reed, Bezault had very little idea of what a liberal arts college was. &#8220;France is like only having public universities. I feel like France and the U.S. are the two extremes of education.&#8221; The quality of research by junior students surprised him. Over the last two years, he helped many of Suzy&#8217;s students with their research projects, especially in the summer when the Renn lab is a bustling hub of research. Since post-docs are a relatively new Reed phenomenon, Bezault asks: &#8220;How are post-docs considered? Since we&#8217;re not alumni and not faculty, are we Reedies?&#8221;

Biology isn&#8217;t the only department that has post-docs in their labs. Chemistry professor Julie Fry has a post-doc arriving in April to help research atmospheric chemistry of nitrogen oxides in and over a broadleaf forest in the southeastern U.S. Fry’s plan is that after the field work, “the postdoc will work with me and Reed students on lab experiments based on what we learn in the forest.”

Psychology professor Tim Hackenberg also has a post-doc working in the lab. Lavinia Tan arrived at Reed three years ago. She received her B.S. and Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. Tan researches decision-making processes in pigeons and rats. The lab works on many projects, including one that uses interactive touch-screens to study gambling behavior in pigeons.

Coming from New Zealand, Tan says that Portland is “a lot like home. It’s very green and laid back.” Although the vibe is similar, she also enjoys the unique parts of Portland. Her local favorites include First Thursdays and the eateries Produce Row and Santeria. When Tan is not working or enjoying the city, she spends time with her Silken Windhound puppy.

Tan describes her role in the lab as “kind of casual. I teach the students what they need to know to make sure the lab runs and I give them guidance.” She recalls her first time visiting Reed: “I was sitting in on Tim’s class and I was so blown away by how talkative everyone was. There were no awkward silences and people made eye contact and took initiative in the discussion. Everyone was so frickin smart.” When asked about the eye contact, she said, “Okay, maybe they didn’t do that.”

The emergence of post-docs at Reed allows professors to continue focusing on teaching while concurrently facilitating research. As the number of post-docs approaches near a half-dozen, Coate jokes, “We should start a union!”
