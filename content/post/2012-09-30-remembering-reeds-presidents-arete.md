Muriel Wyatt started Reed College as a freshman in 1943. Her mother attended Reed under William Foster, Reed’s very first president, but dropped out during World War One to get married and attend secretarial school. When Wyatt’s mother moved to Corvallis, Oregon, with her husband and her growing family, President Foster made the trip down to visit his old student. At the time, Reed College could boast no more than three hundred undergraduates. To celebrate the inauguration of our new president, alumni, including Muriel Wyatt, gathered in Eliot on Friday afternoon to hear Cricket Palmaree, class of ’67, recite stories of Reed’s past presidents.

In the Reed Oral History Project, there aren’t actually that many stories about presidents. At the meeting, Palmaree joked: “a lot of people have been here without realizing there was a president,” preferring to think of that part of the school as simply “the administration” or, colloquially, as “the man.” Yet there are a few very revealing accounts.

The story telling started with a light-hearted anecdote called _Pie Story One_ in which president Victor Rosenblum got a pie in the face during convocation one year, followed by _Pie Story Two_ in which another pie, during another convocation, hit the recipient of the Howard Vollum Award instead of the student body president it was meant for. McNaughton was remembered as “larger than life”, “an interesting and brash person” whose car was in a perpetual state of disrepair from small accidents. Sullivan was laughed at for being the president of a college “which he wouldn’t let his own daughter go to.”

Presidents of Reed have also been deeply cared for. Richard Scholz, Reed College president from 1920 to 1924, was once described as “The most wonderful man that ever existed” by Vera Jackets, class of ’28, the oldest alumna to participate in the Reed Oral History project. Paul Bragdon, after the suicide of a student, knocked on each and every door of the residence halls to talk to all the students individually.

As we welcome President Kroger, we look forward to witnessing both his successes and his gaffes, and knowing that the name of our fifteenth president will go down in history among these other giants.
