Following the Chinese cultural revolution of the 1980s, an avant-garde literature movement emerged. Linked with postmodernism, it was “a literary Renaissance in which writers were experimenting because they could for the first time,” says Chinese Literature major Wendell Britt.[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2776" alt="wendell" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wendell-229x300.jpg?resize=229%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

His thesis, advised by Alexei Ditter, will focus on a number of short stories by Yu Hua, whose works play with different genres and are “crazy, violent, and removed from the normal understanding of things.”

One of the absurd works that made him famous is called “On the Road at 18.” In it, a young man is travelling through a desolate land in search of an inn. He runs into a truck driver and they smoke a cigarette together before the truck driver offers him a ride. Then the truck breaks down.

Men randomly appear and start stealing the apples in the back of the truck. The young man gets beat up trying to stop them, while the driver looks on and laughs at him before stealing his backpack and leaving. The story ends with the young man reminiscing back to when his father was packing the backpack and telling him to go on a journey to learn about the world.

Unlike many of the writers who were working at the same time, Hua’s stories have been termed apolitical and all of the strange aspects have not been analyzed for possible political undertones.

Britt says his thesis “will attempt to debunk the myth that he is apolitical and explore many of the themes in his work as more than just postmodern.” Britt says Hua can be viewed as a “dystopian writer,” and the interpretation of his works can be “influenced by other understandings of dystopian literature.”

He first got interested in the idea during Jay Dickson’s Post-War British Novels class, where he noticed that many of the British dystopias used similar methods. He asked himself “how those dystopias might be relevant to an analysis of Chinese literature” and “what would happen if dystopias didn’t take place in the future?”

One problem Britt faces in proving these works are dystopian is that all science fiction and western dystopian novels were banned in 1983, while the first of Hua’s stories he’s looking at were published in 1987.

Most dystopian novels are set in the future, but Britt will argue that Hua’s stories “create a dystopian present in which he deals with dystopian themes.”

“It would illuminate some of the confusion other writers have had about him, and provide a new way of looking at non-western literatures that might not have been thought of as dystopias,” says Britt.

“A protagonist’s perception of the world can be dystopic,” says Britt, explaining ways dystopianism can be conceived outside of the usual characteristics. Another form of dystopic literature is one in which “a narrative of idealized society is subverted and the expectations of leaders and characters are colored by that subversion.”

If he can prove that, it will allow him to be able to conclude Hua’s stories are in fact politically charged. The “dystopian genre is politicized,” says Britt, “because it remarks on the sociopolitical norms at work in the world.”
