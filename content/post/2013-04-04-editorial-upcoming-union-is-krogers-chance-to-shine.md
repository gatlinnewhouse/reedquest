The powers that be didn’t hold the Reed Union on climate change to discuss Reedies’ opinions about climate change. The Union was an attempt to address—or appease—the nascent fossil fuel divestment movement. By framing the Union as one about climate change, the Union committee, inadvertently or not, painted over new concerns with a gloss of the familiar. Who wants to discuss climate change anymore? Surely we all agree on that. In defining the Union, the committee tacitly disregarded divestment, the issue actually at hand.

In the same way, next week’s Union on student autonomy is nominally about the “possibilities and limits” of student autonomy, but the announcement for the Union in this week&#8217;s issue of _The Quest_ acknowledges that “[t]his Union grew out of some concern in the community for the cancelling of several classes during this year’s Paideia.” Rather than address the Paideia issue specifically, the Union will instead place the incident within a general history of student autonomy, and the complexities of the controversy will be lost. The Union is founded on the premise that the Paideia controversy was primarily about student autonomy. Consider the implications of a Reed Union not on “student autonomy” but on “presidential overreach.” Implicit in the Union’s scope is the notion that student autonomy has “limits,” not that President Kroger made an error of communication or an error from ignorance.

But this Union could also be framed as, “The Freedom of Olde Reed vs. The Legal Reality of Nü Reed.” Student body autonomy outside of the classroom has always been an integral part of Reed’s culture, and any discussion about student body autonomy is inevitably about Reed’s identity. While it is probably best that the drug-laden Renn Fayre lodges of past decades will never return, the financial agency of Senate and scope of student-led events, including Renn Fayre and Paideia, may still be at risk. Alumni also have a stake in preserving Reed’s identity. President Kroger’s decision to limit and cancel Paideia classes upset some alumni so much that they now refuse to donate to Reed. Jessica Benjamin ’93, member of the Alumni Board of Directors, the Alumni Media Committee, and the Alumni Association’s Boston Chapter, so dedicated to Reed that President Diver called her “the super volunteer,” resigned as a result of President Kroger’s actions. Young alumni, who already give to Reed in lower numbers than those of Reed’s peer institutions, are especially at risk of alienation. The administration and the student body need to find a way to preserve _and_ cultivate Reed’s culture of student independence in and out of the classroom while simultaneously addressing Reed’s new legal reality, or both the student body and the college as a whole will suffer.

President Kroger has a chance to make the Union&#8217;s discussion productive and prove to the student body that he takes student body concerns—about his actions, the future of the student body in general, and Reed’s identity—seriously. His absence would be conspicuous.
