**Lipstick, wigs, and fishnets, oh my!
  
Gray Fund presents Sissyboy
  
September 23, 7pm
  
Vollum Lecture Hall**

Every semester, we at Gray Fund try to bring you a variety of programming: specifically at least one independent film. This year, we are going above and beyond. Not only are we screening Sissyboy, a documentary about Portland’s own alternative drag community, but we’ll have among the audience the film’s director, producer, and several stars of Sissyboy. There will be a reception following the viewing where the Reed community will have the chance to talk with the makers of this incredible and unique work.

In addition, RSCAT will be hosting a Sissyboy-inspired discussion from 12-1:30pm this Friday in the Student Center.

A brief synopsis of the film:

They’ve been called “gender terrorists”, “performance art revolutionaries”, and the “kind of drag queens your mother warned you about”; but underneath all of the spectacle of Portland’s premiere shock-drag troupe is a group of amazingly insightful and sensitive individuals who have found an outlet for their self-expression that often leaves their audiences simultaneously delighted and horrified.
