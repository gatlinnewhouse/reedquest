Reed has signed a three-year $5.4 million energy efficiency contract with Ameresco Quantum, the energy efficiency company announced Wednesday.

The effort is expected to reduce the college’s energy costs by $2.7 million over the next decade and annual carbon dioxide emissions by 1,202 metric tons, an eighth of the 9,500 metric tons Reed emits annually. Reed spent nearly $1.8 million on energy and water in its 2011-2012 fiscal year alone.

The project will focus on the Library, the Chemistry building, the Educational Technology Center, Eliot Hall, the Vollum College Center, the Sports Center, the Gray Campus Center, and the Physical Plant, Director of Facilities Services Townsend Angell says. In addition to installing “a campus energy dashboard which will be viewable by anyone on campus,” the initiative will replace and tune mechanical equipment, install a new high-efficiency steam boiler, and augment extant systems with variable frequency drives, which save energy by selectively adjusting the speed of machinery like pumps and fans. Current boilers are efficient, but so large that running them during the summer is wasteful. A new, smaller boiler will be added for use in warmer weather.

But the program doesn’t stop there. All plumbing fixtures on campus will be retrofitted to reduce water use, and all campus light fixtures will be fitted with energy efficient bulbs or LEDs. The college’s electricity usage is expected to drop 12%, its natural gas usage to drop 17%, and its water usage to drop 25%.

Angell says there are multiple motivations behind the project.

The financial benefits are obvious and long-lasting, he says. The contract’s $5.4 million is to be paid over three years in $1.8 million increments, and the Energy Trust of Oregon, a non-profit, is offering up to $300,000 in incentives for the project, and other monies are being drawn from Physical Plant&#8217;s maintenance and replacement funds. Reed will enjoy financial returns for decades to come.

The project also contrasts favorably with the approach many other colleges take. Some institutions buy energy credits to offset their emissions rather than reduce their emissions themselves. “Reed&#8217;s approach to sustainability,” Angell explains, “and one of the goals of the Sustainability Committee is to identify projects that could be executed right here on campus that directly reduce our carbon footprint. This is a significant effort in that direction.”

Of course, there are PR rewards to be reaped as well. Angell says the program “is something the college can be proud of.”

In an era when it’s cool to go green, the contract might become the Admissions Office’s crown-jewel, but it represents only a part of Physical Plant’s current efforts to reduce Reed’s environmental footprint. Plans to install solar panels on the college-owned warehouses on SE 28th Avenue are currently underway. These efforts, combined with “staff awareness and training in operational efficiencies and practices,” can initiate community discussion about taking further action on an individual level, Angell says.

Physical Plant has also created a facilities energy team in working with the Energy Trust of Oregon on a yearlong project to “broaden the dialogue on campus,” Angell says. “The team would welcome interested student energy champions to promote ideas and strategies of engagement involving more people in energy reduction competitions, waste and recycling awareness, promotion of positive personal practices and communicating new opportunities and accomplishments aimed at decreasing energy dependance.”
