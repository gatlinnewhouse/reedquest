Monday nights on the Reed campus are usually pretty stressful, and this Monday’s dreary April weather certainly wasn’t making things any more pleasant. Drizzly and grey, students trucked dutifully from classrooms to the library to Commons and back, faces drawn and pallid from lack of sun exposure. The previous Friday’s glorious burst of sunshine looked, for all intents and purposes, like a sick joke the universe had decided to play on Portland.

Nonetheless, campus was pretty busy for a Monday night. At least three major events took place: Kaul Auditorium was packed with students eager to discuss the state of the Honor Principle at Reed, Buddy Wakefield gave a late-night poetry reading in Winch, and, in the SU, Commons’ very own Twinka Thiebaud was giving a “fireside chat” on her recently published book, What Doncha Know? About Henry Miller.

Twinka is infamous on campus. While some of you may know her only as a friendly Commons worker, most students are privy to her past, or have at least heard rumors. The daughter of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, Twinka is known for both being the model who posed in Life magazine’s first full frontal nude photograph and for living with the great novelist Henry Miller as a cook and caretaker toward the end of his life. During her stay with Miller, she began to take notes on the stories he told her and his guests, as well as chronicling the visits of the high-profile figures who would come over for dinner. Upon seeing her notes, Miller encouraged her to compile them into a book. Her book, Reflections, was published in 1981. Prompted by her publisher, Thiebaud has rewritten Reflections to include more of her own personal narrative. The revision, entitled What Doncha Know? About Henry Miller, was published in February of this year.

Thiebaud was unassuming as she sat comfortably in a chair on the SU floor, part of a circle of seating surrounding a table laden with Henry Miller books from her personal library, copies of What Doncha Know?, and a platter of cookies. Softspoken but self-assured, Thiebaud recalled stories from her stay with Miller in the way one imagines Miller recalling the stories he told Thiebaud. Her obvious respect for Miller, combined with her down-to-earth attitude, made for some truly engaging tales.

“He was a romantic,” Thiebaud said, rocking back in her seat as students gathered round, sipping beer and munching on cookies. Reading from sections of her book and answering any and all questions, Thiebaud regaled with glimpses into what must have been a truly fascinating experience. When initially asked if there were any people she met during her stay that a present-day audience would recognize, Thiebaud simply smiled and waved her hand as if she was dismissing the question.

“Oh, you know. Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson…” she rattled off a short list of celebrities and famous figures that had most in disbelief. She spoke of Bob Dylan’s visit, Miller’s many lovers and affixation with writing love letters, and his refusal to have the Beatles over for dinner when they came to the United States for the first time.

“When he told us that, our eyes just got as wide as saucers,” said Thiebaud. Miller’s refusal to meet John Lennon, who was a fan, was only one of the many juicy accounts Thiebaud had to share. She spoke of Anais Nin’s dinner visits, fans and aspiring writers making pilgrimages to his home in Big Sur to seek his wisdom, and the piano he gifted her that now resides in the Sylvia Beach Hotel on the Oregon Coast.

The event, which received limited advertising, went unnoticed by most in the community. Still, a sizable number of students showed up with questions—what did Miller like to eat? How did Thiebaud end up living in his house?–and were given answers that were both informative and entertaining. It’s unfortunate that so many missed out on hearing about the remarkable life this community member has led, but hopefully sometime we’ll all have the chance to sit down and be captivated by Twinka’s stories once more.
