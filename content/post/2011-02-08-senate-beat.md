Did you notice the absence of chill peeps this Monday at 5? That’s probs because they were all at the Senate Town Hall Meeting – where you should have been, too, duh. If you had been there, you would have been able to chillax with your lovely Beat writers. You would have been with us, watching Will Gester tip tap away on his lappy top, new Prez Nora McCJ chomp away on her poppy corn, and Jenny CW lounging loungily on the couchy couch. But fo realz, Town Hall was hip hoppin. It was the place to be. 

For those who are unfamiliar, Town Hall occurs at the first Senate meeting of the semester.
  
It’s your opportunity to meet your new Senate and talk to your Senators about what you’d like to see go down this semester. If you missed the meeting, fret not. Your Beat writers will fill you in on what you missed, and you can be sure to hit up your Senate at future meetings (Mondays at 5 in the SU!). 

The meeting started out with names and positions (aaw yeah) of everyone huddled awkwardly in the corner of the SU. Senator Schwartz launched into Senate agenda item numero uno: wage review. Did you know that the Head Treasurer is paid more than the VP? And that J-Board is paid the same amount as Senate secretary?! And that pdoxx managers make $700/mo?! Because of oddities like these, Senate will appoint two students to do a full wage review of the student body and submit recommendations, hopefully by the end of the semester. Senator Schwartz mentioned the need to review the student body fee in accordance with the bylaws written last semester.

Senator Carlisle channeled Jaycoxian principles (see 2010) and talked about Senate’s wishes to turn the Alcohol and Other Drug Implementation Plan into actual policy so that the administration, student body, and faculty would be forced to vote on it. As it stands currently, the plan was simply put forth by the Alcohol and Other Drug Committee and was never officially voted on/accepted by the community. Lame sauce.

(This is about when Senator Garon walked in late due to a “meeting” with the pdoxx&#8230; and awkwardly introduced himself.)

Senate hopes to make Honor Council &#8220;more relevant and more effective.” They want HC to draft position papers on key community issues, but that will kind of negate HC’s role as an impartial mediator. To preserve HC’s unbiasedness, the non-mediator members of HC would draft the papers and reach out to the community.

Apparently we want a medical amnesty policy, which was pretty much declared pointless last semester considering, uhh, nothing happens when you are caught drinking copious amounts of booze next to your puking friend. Good in theory, but when you go to a school where supa cool CSOs stand in the place of the Po-Po, medical amnesty is not all that necessario.

The VP wants Senate to look at the dog policy which probably has nothing to do with a certain adorable black lab of his. I don’t know what they’re gonna talk about, or how, or really why, but whatever, it&#8217;s student body government&#8230;

Finally, they want to get more students on committees. Because apparently committees exist that we aren’t a part of. We’re outraged! In our combined 8 semesters on senate, we never once had the opportunity to sit on the Parker House Committee. Ouchie! It’s like being the only kid in class not invited to Vanessa’s birthday party at the Discovery Zone in second grade. Fuck Vanessa. Fuck. That. Shit. Please Senate, get on it.

On to committee reports! Renn Fayre Committee met and people are concerned because Day Three of our Glorious Renn Fayre happens to fall on every mom’s favorite Hallmark Holiday, Mother’s Day. Why the worry? Mostly because half of PDX spends the day with momma and grammy at the Rhodie Gardens and park in our notoriously quaint West Parking Lot. Also, call your mother.

Senator Garon also met the pdoxx managers for the first time EVER and drank some coffee.

Senator Schwartz “drew the short straw” (not that senate EVER draws straws regarding important decisions) and sat in on the Emergency Response Team meeting over break.
  
According to Gary Granger, they spent the time reviewing the incident before break in the West Parking Lot and about whether or not the text message alert system should be opt in or opt out for students. Senate feels like the email alert system should be opt out, while texts should be opt in. For now, you should go to iris.reed.edu and sign up for the fucking system so you know when shit’s goin down.

Appointments Chair Carlisle wants you to apply for J-Board and Appeals Board (applications currently up on SIN), and Nitrogen Day Czar and Diversity Committee realll soon.

Finally, Preliminary Finance Committee only has $300 left! Go ask them for money next Monday at 4:00 in Vollum 110 (they might change rooms, so check SBinfo). They wouldn’t say what they had spent money on, but I know it wasn’t FOTQ. I want my chicken wings, dammit!

Meeting adjourned. We kicked it at Oaks Bottom Pub with some tots and pints afterwards and gossiped about all of our free time and how now that we aren’t on Senate we’re going to lounge by the pool and drink piña coladas all day. Find us some sugar padres. Maybe work on our theses. How’s that feel, Senate?
