“It must be dangerous, this material, or why else would we watch?” read Paisley Rekdal from her final poem of the evening, “Murano.” Last Thursday’s poetry reading in Eliot Chapel marked the beginning of this year’s Visiting Writer’s Series, and those who filled the pews got a taste of Rekdal’s unique, dynamic, and often intense poetry.

Creative Writing Professor Samiya Bashir began the evening with an account of her first exposure to Rekdal’s poetry at a salon in Denver, an experience which, “melted the skin from my frame, and wrapped it back on a bit too tightly for my comfort.”

Attesting to Rekdal’s renown, she went on to list Rekdal’s many literary awards, which include a Village Voice Writers on the Verge Award, an NEA Fellowship, and a Fulbright Fellowship. Rekdal, a Seattle native and currently an associate professor at the University of Utah, is the author of a book of essays, _The Night My Mother Met Bruce Lee_; a hybrid-genre photo-text memoir, _Intimate_; and four books of poetry: _A Crash of Rhinos_, _Six Girls Without Pants_, _The Invention of the Kaleidoscope_, and _Animal Eye_.

Rekdal lead with two poems from her 2012 collection _Animal Eye_ (winner of the UNT Rilke Prize) before shifting to a series of new poems.

The poet showcased both her ability to work with complex poetic structures and her penchant for viewing subjects in interesting ways with a series of poems about her childhood idol, actress and playwright Mae West.

&#8220;When I was a kid I was obsessed with Mae West&#8230;I used to dress up like her all the time,” explained Rekdal. “I had always seen her as a very uncomplicated and obvious feminist hero, but the more you actually learn about her life and the more you learn about the persona she portrayed, the kind of more complicated that portrait of her feminism becomes.”

Reading the opening line of her first Mae West poem, “Go West,” in a thick nasal New York accent, Rekdal did her best to emulate her larger-than-life muse: “Your hands, your lips, your hair, your magnificent effervescence…” Yet as she continued her accent softened, and by the end of the crown of sonnets her West impersonation had become a hybrid of the poet’s soft, steady cadence and the star’s own spunky voice.

The gray area between influence and emulation is where Rekdal’s West poems reside. When asked at the end of her reading whether the constrictive structures she used for these poems, such as sonnets and anagrams, made the writing of these poems difficult, she reflected upon the constrictive nature of Mae West’s public persona in relation to her actual self.

“In a way Mae West&#8217;s own life was really constrictive&#8230;she never broke character…The constricting form and sort of wrapping around wordplay, it can read as hollow at times, and that&#8217;s because she reads as hollow at times too. There&#8217;s a lot to say about her, and to a certain extent there&#8217;s not much personally you can say about her.”

West’s final two poems, one entitled “When It Is Over, It Will Be Over,” the other “Murano,” demonstrated the poet’s keen eye, as well as her ability to pare objects and scenes down to their bare elements. “When It Is Over, It Will Be Over,” inspired by a gestural painting of the same name, broke the piece of art into words and canvas before weaving in a personal tale, while “Murano,” a depiction of a tour through an Italian glass blowing factory, adroitly captured both the banality and profundity of her foreign experience.

Rekdal wrapped up the evening with a brief Q&A session, fielding questions about her Mae West poems before humbly taking a seat to sign books and chat while the audience mingled and slowly trickled out of the chapel.
