This academic year, Reed College welcomed the largest group of international students ever into its community—making the Class of 2017 the most internationally and ethnically diverse class of students in the history of the college. This group includes 11 exchange students from three different nations, 39 students on visas from 24 different nations, and seven US citizens who identify themselves as international students as well.

“Ten percent of the class are international citizens, and also ten percent of the students (of any nationality) attended school outside the U.S.,” said Keith Todd, Dean of Admission, during an interview. “Two trends that contribute to this would be the continuing strong presence of Asia in our international student group, and an increase in international citizens in our application pool this year,” added Todd, highlighting the class of 2017’s diversity. Although the admission rate for international students requesting aid is very competitive, “Approximately 15 international students with financial aid are in the class, on the high side of average,” said Todd.

Many take the growing presence of international students at Reed not as a surprise, but as a fruitful outcome of the college’s hard effort to increase its diversity. “We have literally doubled the amount of time we spend in Asia recruiting—from two weeks a year to four,” commented Todd, explaining the admission office’s attempt to attract qualified students from all over the world. “In the past two years, we have recruited in Vietnam for the first time, and in India and mainland China for the first time in a number of years. Every summer, we attend the international conference for college guidance counselors from schools around the world, and we network with these key influencers.” Todd also mentioned that it is true that the number of students across Asia who wish to attend college in the US is increasing, and “we [The Admission Office] are working to engage with this group of students, as well,”

But putting the admission aspects aside, many people at Reed are still anticipating how the college’s growing diversity is going to affect the community as a whole. For instance, the college’s International Student Service Office (ISS) under the leadership of Dana Bays Lawson has been very involved in the entire process. “We have programs like ‘Hello from Reed’ that enable prospective international students to seriously consider Reed by pairing them up with our current international students through email,” said Lawson. According to Lawson, the office also aims to provide assistance to the international students’ well being throughout their time at Reed. “Not to mention its [Reed’s] challenging academic experience that fosters an interactive environment things like homesickness, culture differences, and co-ed bathrooms could come as a shock to many international students. We try our best to accommodate various needs of international students,” commented Lawson.

After participating in Reed’s International Odyssey Orientation and regular New Student Orientation, the new international students began their classes with fellow Reedies on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2013. “I’m just really excited about the diversity and the range of perspectives international students bring to Reed, and hope that this would continue,” added Lawson, “They really do enrich the learning environment at Reed.”
