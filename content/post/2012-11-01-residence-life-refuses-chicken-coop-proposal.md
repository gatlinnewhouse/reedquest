Student efforts to add a chicken coop to the student garden adjacent to the Farm Co-op were shut down by Residence Life and Facilities Services. In their proposal to Residence Life, students who use the garden asked permission to purchase four adult hens and house them beside the student garden.

Students intended the effort to be a first step in expanding the garden program, which is largely unknown on campus and has only four regular student gardeners. Carolyn Kato, student gardener and a lead advocate for the project, says, &#8220;My purpose in this project was to facilitate further student involvement in the student garden. When other students started expressing interest in a chicken coop project, I took that energy and ran with it. It&#8217;s these types of ideas and energy that make me excited to be a student here.”

Kato and several other students committed to full responsibility of the chickens throughout the year and over breaks. However, Residence Life responded to the proposal, saying in an email, “Theoretically we like the idea of having chickens on campus, but practically there is not enough staff support or funding for it…Reed doesn&#8217;t want to take out a permit to raise chickens and would not authorize others to take out a permit to do so on campus property…A woman who lives right next to campus recently got rid of her chickens because they were noisy, required a lot of cleaning, and attracted rats. Because of these concerns, we are just not comfortable moving forward with allowing &#8216;community&#8217; animals on campus.” No meeting was held with students after it was submitted.

Sam Law, member of the Farm Co-op and supporter of the initiative, says, “Raising chickens is an amazing educational opportunity to reconnect with a part of the food process that has, in a sense, been taken away from us&#8230;It was dishonorable to not let us have a part in this process and not give a transparent discourse. We have tried to deal with them as peers, and they haven’t treated us as members of the Reed community governed by the honor principle.”

In response to Law’s comment, Residence Life Administrative Assistant Clea Taylor, who responded to the original proposal, says, “I would like to let [the student body] know that I have made myself available to meet with students regarding the idea of keeping chickens on campus and have offered to meet a second time. Although theoretically I like the idea of having chickens on campus and agree that it could be a positive opportunity for students, the fact is that unfortunately there is currently not enough staff support or funding for that type of program.”

But, Kato says, &#8220;Despite the initial rejection of our proposal, we&#8217;re still hoping to start up a dialogue between the students and the administration about the logistics and further implications of this project. Yes, at the end of the day, they are just fucking chickens! But still, there are lots of different directions that we can go about doing this – so we&#8217;re really just trying to see where everybody is at with this idea in order to make it work out for all parties involved.&#8221;

While the proposal to add a chicken coop to the student garden may seem simple, Reed’s history with the bird is less so. In 2010, Gabriel Holt ’10 planned a Paideia class on humanely slaughtering chickens and arranged to get two old hens from a nearby free-range poultry farm for that purpose. But Leslie Zukor ’11 sent a tip about the class to the Portland Animal Defense League, and soon Holt received multiple threatening emails and Facebook messages. One upset activist told him to “Go kill yourself and eat your intestines.”

Holt gave in to the pressure and cancelled the slaughter portion of the class, instead purchasing two already-dead chickens from Safeway. Despite Holt’s change of plans, he awoke the day of the class to find that the four laying-hens he and his housemates kept in the backyard  of their house off-campus had disappeared.
