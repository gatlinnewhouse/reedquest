The class of 2017 gathered together as a group for the first time last week for Reed College’s annual Convocation address. President John Kroger opened by welcoming the new class and saying a few words about the value of a liberal arts education. He understood that spending four years devoted to intellectual pursuits was an “immense investment of money, time, and effort;” but also said it was “the greatest decision someone could make.”  He urged the entering class towards “self-critical, rigorous thinking” and implored them to “think critically for themselves” before calling them “totally awesome” and stating his confidence in their “creativity and intellectual firepower.”

The closing words of his speech hinted at the transitional period Reed is currently in, as he advised the freshmen to “embrace positive changes and make the most of [their] time here.”

Student Body President Ari Galper ’14 was the next to take to the stand. He urged them to “shake it up a little bit” and “make your mark.” Offering an example of how one might do this, he then broke into a “convocation dance”, much to the amusement of President Kroger. He closed on a more serious, but no less fervent note, urging the new Reedies to “take advantage of opportunities and create them” because “the best experiences you will have at Reed are the ones you seek out.”

The Orientation Coordinators, Dean Schmeltz and Jenn Lindell, welcomed the incoming class next. They explained their Orientation Week theme, ‘An Unexpected Journey’, by saying that they “learn the most when they are challenged and surprised” and advised the new class to “be like Bilbo.” “The greatest return,” they concluded, “will be your education and the lifelong friends you make. Being a good student is important, being a good friend more so.”

Keith Todd, Dean of Admissions, told the incoming class they are perhaps the most diverse in school history, with 35% of incoming students identifying as people of color. He went on to provide many more facts about the entering class with many more statistical insights; including the most common high schools attended, the most prevalent names, and a host of other facts (stay tuned to the Quest for more details). He ended his speech with a simple declaration: “enter a college like no other.”

Kip Thorne, who gave a lecture the day before, was honored with the Howard Vollum Award for Distinguished Accomplishment in Science and Technology. After explaining why he turned down Reed to attend Caltech, he went on to talk about how much he wanted a liberal arts education and was happy to find a liberal education base at Caltech that has informed his thinking ever since.

He explained how he ended up in Russia with Soviet Hydrogen Bomb theorists, being watched by the FBI, and that he found the cultural understanding he received as an undergrad to be indispensable. Apart from his day job as a world-renowned physicist he has been part of a new Hollywood venture, where he said he met a World’s Sexiest Man and World’s Sexiest Woman, who took surprising interest in his area of Physics.

Following the presentation of the Vollum Award, another Reed tradition was honored once again with the first introductory Humanities 110 Lecture—this year given by Political Science Professor Peter Steinberger. Even though the syllabus is starting with Gilgamesh and The Iliad is the only Homer, Peter’s lecture focused on The Odyssey as a fundamental Humanities text. He told of a false story Odysseus tells of his journey home and offered some introductory thoughts on “establishing truth and reality from the appearance of truth and reality.” He discussed the “relationship between thoughts and the world” and spoke briefly about the use of objectivity. “How we can establish truths from mere appearances is an underlying human question,” he said, explaining that these concepts can be explored through authors like Homer. “The liberal arts education and Hum 110,” he concluded, “are part and parcel of what it means to be human.”

President Kroger continued where Peter left off, calling the life of the mind “central to human existence,” before offering some final advice: “If you want to hang out with the sexiest people in the world, start by becoming one of the best physicists on the planet.”
