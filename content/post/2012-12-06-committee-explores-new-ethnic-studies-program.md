Ethnic studies is being considered as a new major at Reed. An exploratory committee of faculty members is currently discussing questions such as the structure of the major, hiring new faculty, and cost—among other issues.

Once the committee has a concrete idea of what the major would be, a proposal will be made to the Committee Academic Policy and Planning, the body made of students and faculty that makes recommendations on the college&#8217;s curriculum.

“What a race and ethnic studies program does is look at how the categories of race and ethnicity operate and are structured in societies,” David Garrett, professor of history and chair of the ethnic studies committee, says. The committee includes faculty representatives from most of the humanistic departments.

Central to the discussion is the question of “what _is_ ethnic studies.” According to Garrett, there are two major approaches one can take; that is, race and ethnic studies as they relate to American society, or questions of race and ethnic studies in terms of how they affect societies globally.

The approach the committee chooses will determine what kinds of classes are offered at Reed for the program. In addition, the classes must fit in with Reed’s larger approach to the curriculum. For example, Garrett says that it’s common for liberal arts institutions to offer programs like ethnic studies as minors, as a way of integrating interdisciplinary study into more traditional disciplinary structures. Offering a minor, however, is not an option at Reed.

Another point of discussion is whether the department would be freestanding or not. One possibility is to offer courses from various departments, taught in the strict context of a particular subject. The other choice would be to create interdisciplinary classes specifically for the ethnic studies major.

A similar discipline was a flash point in the 1970s when students pushed for a black studies program, and the faculty clashed over it. A program was instituted, but was shortly abandoned.

Garrett says interest among faculty for adding an ethnic studies program has been long in the brewing. He expects an ethnic studies program to materialize within five or six years, the same amount of time it took to establish the interdisciplinary environmental studies program.

“Over the past 20 to 30 years, interdisciplinary majors have become much more popular in American academia,” he says.

According to Garrett, the faculty sees the ethnic studies program as compatible with Reed’s academic direction, in that it builds on a disciplinary focus.

“There is not a sense among the faculty at all to diminish disciplinary rigor,” Garrett says. “We are interested in addressing new questions.”
