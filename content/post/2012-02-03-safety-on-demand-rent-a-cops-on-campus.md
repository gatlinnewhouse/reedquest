This semester, nocturnal Reedies should expect to see some unfamiliar faces around campus. Reed hired Pacific Patrol Services (PPS), a private security company serving “the purpose of having a uniformed officer in a marked vehicle patrolling the campus and bordering streets from 8PM to 2AM every day,” said Gary Granger, Director of Community Safety.

Pacific Patrol Services was hired following the two armed muggings that took place on campus. The first incident took place on November 15 when three men robbed two students at gunpoint outside of Naito/Sullivan. On December 7, a second incident occurred when a student and her mother were robbed at gunpoint by two men outside of Prexy.

Community Safety hopes that PPS will prevent further crime from taking place on campus. Granger assured that the PPS officers will not replace the Community Safety Officers in any way. “The private security officers do not perform any functions [besides patrol], so they don&#8217;t do escorts or unlocks; they don&#8217;t take CSO calls. All they do is patrol, observe, and report any problems to the CSOs,” he explained.

Granger stressed that the PPS presence is a temporary measure that he expects will carry on until the semester ends. Meanwhile, Granger plans to reinstate the Student Patrol Officer (SPO) program, in which students support the CSOs by observing campus and doing unlocks. “My plan is to reconstitute the SPO program over the course of the spring so that we can transition to having SPOs do this work and stop paying a private firm, but that will take weeks, if not longer, to put in place,” he said.

Further, Granger noted that the robbery detectives from the Portland Police Bureau who have been investigating the robberies on campus do not believe that the muggings were aimed at Reed specifically. He explained that “[the detectives] are working the case pretty actively, along with a string of very similar robberies with similar suspects within about a 2-mile radius of Reed.”

Nevertheless, Granger emphasized the need for students to take precautionary measures. “I&#8217;m hoping students and others will avoid presenting easy targets by walking in groups, getting CSO escorts, [and] using the most heavily traveled routes.” Such simple measures can contribute greatly to the safety of the Reed community.
