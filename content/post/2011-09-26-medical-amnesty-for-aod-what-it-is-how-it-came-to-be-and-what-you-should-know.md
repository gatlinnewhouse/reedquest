Last year, Reed began to implement its old AOD policy in extremely different ways: students who might, in the past, simply have had their alcohol or illegal substances confiscated by a Community Safety Officer, now received an “AOD violation” for drinking or substance use if caught.

This change kicked off a year of heated debate. One of the most powerful critiques of the new implementation plan was the lack of medical amnesty: a student, in the case of a medical emergency caused by alcohol or drugs, would still be given an AOD violation if Community Safety was called. In the words of Dean of Students Mike Brody, “There does seem to be&#8230;evidence&#8230;that medical amnesty might help reduce the likelihood that someone in need of help due to excessive AOD intoxication would fail to get that help due to fears of reprisal.”

Brody, concerned about the safety of Reed students, began working with a group of students last fall, mostly from SSDP (Students for a Sensible Drug Policy). He also worked with the Health and Counseling Center. They met many times and shared input, and by the end of the year had two different but very closely related amnesty plans. They then shared them with an external review committee, which made changes and recommendations. Reed&#8217;s Drug and Alcohol Committee, which is made up of faculty, administrators, and students, reviewed the document and finalized the plan.

So what exactly does this plan do? To quote from the “Medical Amnesty Guidelines,” “When a student experiences a physical and/or psychological crisis while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs (AOD), neither the student in crisis nor any student calling for help will be subject to disciplinary action for personal possession or use of illicit substances, including consumption of alcohol by minors.”

This amnesty for both the at-risk intoxicated person and any person who calls for help is contingent on a few things – the CSOs can take any visible drug paraphernalia and look around the residence only to the extent that they find out what substances may be affecting the student. The case is documented for health purposes. The student may be required to attend up to two sessions at the health and counseling center (or an off campus counselor with the approval of the HCC).

There are some exceptions to medical amnesty; as the guidelines say, “The Medical Amnesty Policy should not be abused. Misuse and abuse of this policy will be considered a violation of the Honor Principle.” Medical Amnesty only covers AOD, it does not apply to other violations of Reed policies (such as vandalism, sexual assault, or drug dealing). People who invoke the medical amnesty policy and then have another AOD related emergency may lose their amnesty, although the policy is vague on the specifics of this.

Finally, it is important to note that the medical amnesty policy states that any victim of sexual assault has automatic amnesty from any AOD violation, and that Reed, “will not pursue disciplinary action against the sexual assault survivor.”

But why does this plan carry the “interim” label? Will it be going away soon? No, says Brody. The plan is here to stay; the reason for the interim label is that, “we have not yet had a chance to hear input from the entire community.” After receiving input from the student body and seeing what works and what doesn&#8217;t, Brody says, “we&#8217;ll make the changes we need to make, probably sometime in the spring. At that point, if it works, it&#8217;s here to stay, unless and until we can come up with something better, again in collaboration with all the concerned community constituencies.”

Brody noted, “By the way, the literature also suggests that medical amnesty is unlikely to be effective unless it accompanies a comprehensive approach to AOD, including education/prevention, treatment and enforcement,” suggesting that he sees the need for a strong medical amnesty plan for the future, but is still an active supporter of the changes to the AOD implementation plan in the past.
