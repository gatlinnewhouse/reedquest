**Andrew Choi and En-Szu Hu-Van Wright**

If you’re new around here, you’ll quickly find out that Portland is a great place for music. The fact that we’re sandwiched between LA and Seattle means that all the good bands end up coming through here. MusicfestNW (abbreviated as MFNW) is unquestionably Portland’s largest alternative music event. It’s the Pacific Northwest’s equivalent to South by Southwest, offering shows at venues across Portland over the course of five days. Admission to all MFNW shows requires a wristband, but you can also buy tickets to the shows that suit your fancy. Here are some of our recommendations:

**Major Lazor**: MAYYYJUH LAYYYZUH! As wonderful as that indie synth may be, nothing—seriously, nothing—beats the mind-to-ass blowing dub beats created by Switch and Diplo. They’re the two DJs behind Major Lazer, but you won’t find them on any album cover. Instead, you’ll find ‘80s-style cartoon character who fought in the Secret Zombie War and, now undercover as a part-time club owner/full-time partier, is dropping the dirtiest electro-dancehall this side of Trinidad. If Major Lazer doesn’t get you out to MFNW, you probably shouldn’t even bother going.

Free Energy**: You should see Free Energy because they kick ass and just want to rock out until they are physically unable to anymore. Glamorously reminiscent of 70s garage rock, their jams are sheer summery bliss in the most badass way possible. Free Energy invites you to hoist up your beer and forget about responsibility for a while. Put on your favorite motorcycle boots and prepare to party like a real American motherfucker.

**Surfer Blood**: “Floating Vibes” was definitely the ultimate summer song for a lot of people this year, and with good reason – Surfer Blood has quickly shown itself to be not only a great band in the studio, but an amazing stage presence as well. Sure, there’s no beach around, but they bring coast indoors with their vibrant, catchy tunes.
