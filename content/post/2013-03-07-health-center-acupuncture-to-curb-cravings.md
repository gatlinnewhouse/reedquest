The Health and Counseling Center is now offering acupuncture for students who want to address their cravings. The treatments aim to reduce a wide array of issues, from substance addictions to compulsive internet usage.

No appointments are necessary for the acupuncture treatments, which are available at the Health and Counseling Center every Tuesday from 5-6 p.m. Annie Krueger, Reed’s acupuncturist, is excited about this new offering, but says “what’s really important is if it’s useful for students.”

For those skeptical of the practice, Kreuger says acupuncture serves a meditative purpose as well. “It’s a good half hour of thinking and getting in touch with your body. It brings you down from mental society,” Kreuger says. “The [acupuncture] space really transforms into a healing comforting space.”

During sessions, calming music is played in the background, the lights are dimmed, and one can simply relax in a reclining chair. The needles used are small, not hollow, and not noticeable once applied. During application, the pain is less than that of a pinch. However, Krueger says, “acupuncture is not for everyone,” and those with needle phobia should probably steer clear.

Krueger says acupuncture is especially beneficial for the academically focused Reed community. In Krueger’s view, Reedies work so hard that sometimes they forget how to relax and get back in touch with their bodies. “Sometimes, for you the transition is really hard.” According to Kreuger, acupuncture can make this transition easier. Additionally, Kreuger says holistic healthcare “increases recognition of the idea of balance.” She says it can remind Reed students that taking a break can aid in success.

Health and Counseling still offers their usual acupuncture, which focuses on stress reduction and health wellness. Thirty-minute appointments are available every Tuesday and Thursday from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. This resource is being well utilized—Krueger meets with 10-14 patients per day. Kate Smith, director of Health and Counseling, says, “If we had more money we’d have [Krueger] more.”

The cessation-benefit acupuncture has only been available for the past week, and only one session has taken place. Three acupuncture regulars attended and report enjoying their experience.

For Krueger, the important take-away is the experience, as well as developing the idea of self-care.
