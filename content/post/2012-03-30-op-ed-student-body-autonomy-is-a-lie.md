At Reed, we students are quite fortunate in that we are generally treated as adults, both by the faculty and by the administration. Our professors teach classes with zero “Scantrons” and with few multiple-choice tests, preferring to take the time to test our knowledge with more interesting and useful assignments. Even when the administration takes an action with which many students disagree, such as the arrests in mid-February, top-level administrators (Mike and Gary) came to an open Senate meeting to explain their actions to the extent that they could do so legally, and were markedly more respectful towards students than a number of students were towards them. Hell, even Commons lets us eat wherever we want and take the dishes with us, unlike Bon Appétit’s other college cafeterias.

It is a good thing that we students are generally treated as adults. However, some students seem to have gotten the idea that, not only should we be treated as adults, but also that we should not be subject to any laws at all. Even if this were a good idea, it would still be legally impossible for the administration to follow such a policy. Leaving the facts of the arrests to the side, the Senate meeting about the arrests and the ensuing discussion on The Quest’s website both showed that a number of students hold a strange belief in the “autonomy” of Reed’s student body. As I see it, this is closely connected to a seductive but fundamentally flawed understanding of the Honor Principle. This false version of the Honor Principle could be formulated as followed: “I have the right to do whatever I want as long as I’m not harming anyone.” In addition, the Honor Principle is seen as making federal, state, and local law irrelevant—since we have our own system of governance, no other institution has a right to interfere with us, right? These are the central parts of the myth of Reed’s student body “autonomy.”

It’s time to dispel this myth. For better or worse, the Honor Principle does not give anyone any rights. As Peter Steinberger has argued, the Honor Principle is a “doctrine of unfreedom.” At its barest form, it simply states that community members should be able to justify their actions as honorable, and must reflect on whether or not an action would be honorable before taking it.

Furthermore, the Honor Principle exists within students’ legal responsibilities under the laws of the U.S. Government, of the state of Oregon, and of the city of Portland, as well as under college policy. Even if everyone hypothetically agreed that a given action was honorable, that would be no “get out of jail free” card.

Reedies are intelligent enough to know that the law is not always just, but some students need to wrap their heads around the fact that we are not above the law. When we suffer from the enforcement of unjust laws, the proper response is to call for changes to the law rather than to argue for less enforcement. In fact, lax enforcement of unjust laws at Reed is arguably a bad thing: It encourages Reedies to ignore those unjust laws rather than being forced to fight against them. And if you think that you are somehow fighting the law by smoking pot in your room or on the front lawn, give me a break. If you’re serious about fighting laws against marijuana, get some placards and go smoke in front of Portland’s city hall with the intention of being arrested. Or at least join SSDP in their activism on the issue.

To be completely clear: I am not arguing that the law should be obeyed just because it is the law. What I am arguing is that, if you smoke pot or drink while underage, don’t deny that you are breaking the law or claim any special privileges to shield yourself from enforcement of the law.

While Reed has gotten more than its fair share of media coverage on the issue of drugs, ironically enough, Reed is just like most other colleges and universities in that our student body often breaks national and state drug and alcohol laws. What is, unfortunately, more unique about us is how certain students declare that they have a right to break the law because of their false understanding of the Honor Principle and belief in Reed’s autonomy. Fortunately, it seems to me that these students are a minority, albeit a loud one. I hope that those who believe in our “autonomy” will recognize their mistake, while the majority of the student body will not allow these voices to define our image in the eyes of Portland and the nation.
