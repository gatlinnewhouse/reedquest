Thad E. Hall of The University of Utah visited Reed on March 21st as part of the public policy lecture series. His main point was drawn and quartered somewhere between the effects of extremism in politics, trends in the two-party system, and the use of abortion as a polarizing issue. Though his main focus was Daily Show-esque mockery of the uneducated and the irrational people of this country, he also highlighted influences that shape the American political landscape.

Hall explained the general trend towards a more conservative Republican party as a function of the unified nature of the party. He quoted Will Rogers, saying “I don&#8217;t belong to an organized party, I&#8217;m a democrat!” According to Hall, Republicans blame their losses on being “Not enough of a true believer; not party enough.” In addition to their natural structure, there has also been backlash against the Bush era&#8217;s distinctly nonconservative fiscal stylings. He said that the Tea Party was less of a reaction against Obama than a reaction against Bush&#8217;s deficit-creating wars. Therefore, their logical aim is making the Republican party more conservative.

As Republicans become more conservative, Hall argued that Democrats responded by polarizing and acting as a more unified and opposing body. He said that political allegiance today is more about having your team win than being civically engaged. Hall said that twenty years ago the most liberal Republican was more liberal than the most conservative Democrat. But that overlap is now a thing of the past.

On a less visible level, he argued that interest groups not only influence nominations, but determine them. Though he didn&#8217;t present any data, he said that the candidate with the most endorsements, especially from reproductive rights (or lack thereof) lobbies, wins the nomination. The media&#8217;s inescapable influence was also touched on. Fox news watchers hear Fox News opinions, and NPR listeners hear NPR opinions and can be self-righteous about knowing more facts.

The abortion portion of his talk was two-pronged. First, he pointed out that it involved certain demographics on a game-changing level. Some deeply religious people are obviously very invested in the preservation of zygotes, but surprisingly, middle-class women are invested in their wombs. This sometimes apathetic demographic is passionately involved in this issue.

The result of the politicization of abortion is evident in the scandal about the Susan G. Komen Foundation&#8217;s attempt to cut off all funding to Planned Parenthood. Not only did Planned Parenthood raise more money in a week than they received from the Komen foundation, but the Komen foundation had to shut down their social media presence because of the backlash. They also rescinded their statement and will continue to fund breast exams. Hall argued that they should have removed a little bit of support at a time, because that would have gone unopposed. Similarly, cuts to welfare or additions to healthcare could easily pass through the legislative branch if there was not so much pressure to make every action extreme.
