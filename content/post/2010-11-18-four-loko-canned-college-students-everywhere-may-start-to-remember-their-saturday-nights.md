[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-498" style="margin: 7px;" title="Nestle_FourLoko_11-3_post" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Nestle_FourLoko_11-3_post.jpg?resize=216%2C144" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]Facing mounting pressure from the FDA, outspoken government representatives, and concerned citizens groups, makers of the popular malt beverage Four Loko announced on Tuesday that they will pull the caffeine from the convenience store staple.

The current formula for each standard can contains 12% alcohol, 660 calories, and a caffeine, guarana, and taurine stimulant cocktail equivalent to two cups of coffee. In flavors like blue raspberry and pink lemonade, each can only costs $2.50-$3.00.

“We are taking this step after trying — unsuccessfully — to navigate a difficult and politically-charged regulatory environment at both the state and federal levels,” said Phusion Projects on Tuesday.

The beverage has been blamed for increased hospitalization rates on college campuses across the country since the start of the 2010-2011 academic year, culminating in a number of undergraduate deaths linked to lethal levels of intoxication and drinking and driving accidents. Over two dozens colleges have launched focused anti-Four Loko campaigns, with some outright banning the drink.

Opponents say that the caffeine in the malt beverage often masks the depressive effects of the alcohol. Regular drinkers often assess their sobriety, or lack thereof, based on the degree of these effects, prompting Four Loko drinkers to drink more than they might otherwise. A study by the University of Florida published in February also found that people drinking alcoholic energy drinks are four times as likely to drink and drive as those drinking straight alcohol.

In response to these accusations, Phusion compared Four Loko to common bar drinks like ‘rum and colas’ and ‘Irish coffees’ which, they say, have been consumed for years without cause for concern.

Washington, Michigan, and Utah have already banned the beverage. Quickly following suit, New York State passed a referendum on Monday, November 16, to halt shipments after December 10th. Oklahoma halted shipment on November 3 but has not prohibited vendors from selling their remaining stock. However, the state’s Alcoholic Beverage Laws Enforcement Commission made it clear that they won’t be eulogizing the  ‘blackout in a can’ saying, “Once it’s gone, it’s gone.”

The Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission took a different approach that will avoid pulling Four Loko from the shelves. On Monday an ‘emergency regulation’ period will take effect in which alcoholic beverages containing caffeine, guarana, or other herbal or chemical stimulants will lose their classification as malt beverages for 90 days. As a result, new resealable packaging will contain warning labels and establishments with only beer and wine licenses will no longer be able to carry the canned drink. These measures will theoretically encourage consumers to drink slower and decrease availability by removing Four Loko from gas stations and convenience stores.

In an email statement ­­United Brands Co. Inc., maker of similar caffeinated malt beverage Joose, said they support further clarity in FDA oversight but “United Brands is not aware of a single incident of injury or other harm associated with its products.” In 2008 the Center for Science in the Public Interest sued MillerCoors after finding a hazardous level of caffeine in popular alcoholic drink Sparks, prompting the company to remove the stimulant entirely.
