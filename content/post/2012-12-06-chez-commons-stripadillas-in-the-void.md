Oh chicken strip quesadilla! Affectionately dubbed “stripadilla” by upper-middle-class Reed students from the white-washed flickering halls of Sullivan I to the hive–like conglomerations of cellular living units of FSM, this deep-fried bundle of carbohydrates is a paradox within itself. One teary-eyed senior, reflecting on his earlier years, recalled his first time ordering a stripadilla. “What the fuck, is that for real?” replied the grillmaster, “I’m not gonna make this to your specification… just order what’s on the fucking menu” (some paraphrasing). Ahh, those were different times, but not everyone has such fond memories. Unfortunately for this freshman author, the light at the end of the Reed academic tunnel is as pale and uninspiring as the halogen light under which I eat five commons ‘dillas a day. Is that bad? I feel like that’s bad. Not the thing about the academic tunnel, the thing about the stripadilla. Actually both are pretty unhealthy.

For many the “eating of the stripadilla” marks the student’s arrival at the final and lowest circle of existential crisis. Not unlike Tom Wingfield, the Reed student who eats the stripadilla desires to escape the world, a reality in the pleasant disguise of illusion. Perhaps this warm distraction will take our minds off the rivers of water flowing down Reed’s concrete paths. Perhaps it will keep our innermost insecurities and doubts at bay.

Oh stripadilla! How you deliver us from our mind-numbing gauntlet of problem sets, ego-crushing paper conferences, and endless pages of Herodotus’ musings. The world of academia is no benign reality. It comes with a labyrinth of academic pathways, relentless evaluations, and a heavy price tag. Today freshmen are freshmen, tomorrow they will be seniors, and Sunday they will be forced into a job market unflinchingly hostile to even the most prudent students. According to that timeline, sometime between the following Wednesday and Monday two weeks from now they’ll be dead. This is enough to make even the cheeriest of freshmen ponder the meaninglessness of our existence.

Oh stripadilla! Between the crispy leaves of your tortilla shell lies a cheesy retreat, a greasy fried paradise that outside viewers might find malign, even repulsive. They’ll say, “The cholesterol will harden your arteries.” “Too much cheese will make you fat.” “I heard on FOX News chicken causes cancer.” But that won’t matter. You’ll know deep down in your breaded poultry heart that your spotted pepper-jack cheese is the only color in an otherwise gray universe. The storm clouds of academic uncertainty loom ever-present, but Nowadays, the world is lit by lightning, but as the heat from the incandescent bulbs fades into the ether, the stripadilla will be all that remains.
