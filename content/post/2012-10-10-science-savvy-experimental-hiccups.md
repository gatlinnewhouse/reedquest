Science often appears to be a singular entity, united by a methodological paradigm and totally consistent in its depiction of reality. But science is an active process, full of hiccups. A diverse population of researchers and theorists collect data and construct models to weigh in on fundamental scientific questions. This means that while the methods employed to obtain data should in theory be equivalent, the interpretation of the data can vary dramatically between scientists.

One example of this in the field of developmental neurobiology: two different teams recently investigated how neurons form in the zebrafish retina. While they performed very similar experiments, they came to different conclusions.

A paper published by Neumann and Nuesslein-Volhard (_Science_ 2000) claims to have partially uncovered the mechanism underlying the specification of ganglion cells in zebrafish retinas. Using fluorescent staining techniques, DNA injection, chemical treatment of cells and mutant zebrafish, they determined that the _Sonic hedgehog_ gene (Shh) is crucial for the specification of retinal ganglion cells (RCGs) &#8211; cells that send visual information to the brain. Even more interesting, they found that cells expressing Shh would induce cells adjacent to them to also express Shh, resulting in a self-assembling gene expression wave across the eye, generating the right type of cells at the right time. This same process occurs during retinal development in fruit flies, using the same gene. That could mean that eye development works the same way in both vertebrates and invertebrates, despite wildly divergent eye morphology. Their interpretation of their data supports a model in which developing neurons rely heavily on extrinsic signals from neighboring neurons to determine their fate.

A more recent paper by Kay and colleagues (Development 2005) tested the intrinsic ability of cells in the embryonic eye to differentiate into retinal gangilion cells. By physically eliminating regions of the eye, moving cells from one region to another, and examining mutants lacking Shh (the gene shown to be essential in the 2000 study), they gathered data suggesting that cells can differentiate into RCGs all on their own without the presence of signals from surrounding tissues. They concluded that cells do not necessarily rely on a large-scale signaling wave to differentiate, complicating the question of how cells “know” when to develop and what to develop into. This is quite a different conclusion from Neumann and colleagues, who claim to show that extrinsic signalling is necessary for differentiation. Even though both studies employed the same experimental organism and similar methods, the different teams came up with different answers.

So, which model is true? Just as in most scientific domains, these models may not be mutually exclusive and elements of both are probably required to account for the phenomenon at hand. It is controversies such as these that drive scientific research and generate more nuanced and interesting questions to work on in the future.
