Dear President Kroger,

As representatives of the Student Body, we wish to express our frustration regarding your decision to cancel and alter several of the classes that were offered during the week of Paideia. While opinions vary among the senators, this letter reflects broadly the sentiments shared by a majority of the Student Body Senate.

Paideia is a student-driven and student-financed tradition devoted to the free exchange of ideas between students, alumni, faculty, staff, and other community members. The freedom of expression that Paideia exemplifies certainly has limits, and classes that represent a threat to the safety and wellbeing of any member or members of the Reed community should not be condoned. It is the opinion of the Senate that no class planned to take place during this year’s Paideia represented such a threat as to warrant sudden and non-negotiable alteration and cancelation.

Despite our confidence that your actions were born out of a concern for the health and safety of the Student Body, the unilateral manner by which your decisions were made undermines the spirit of willful communication that is inherent to the Honor Principle and proper to a community dedicated to the life of the mind. Administrative intervention into the affairs of the Student Body not preceded by conversations and the establishment of mutual understanding is harmful to a community whose norms and expectations promote responsible and honorable self-governance. In this case, we believe that your actions inhibited the free exchange of ideas and knowledge on which this community of scholars prides itself. As such, we believe that the recent alteration and cancelation of Paideia classes violates Article VI Section I of the Community Constitution<sup>1 </sup>and the First Principle of the Operating Principles of the College,<sup>2 </sup>both of which pertain to the intolerability of censorship within the Reed community.

Signed,

The Student Body Senate

**<sup>1</sup>****_ Community Constitution_**

_Article VI. Publications and Public Occasions of Expression_

 _Section 1. Publications, exhibitions, public lectures, and public performances under the sponsorship of the College or of recognized organizations within the Reed Community shall not be subject to institutional censorship. Publications supported wholly by Student Body funds, or by Student Body funds supplemented by revenues external to the College, shall not be subject to censorship or editorial control by the College, by the Student Body Senate, or by any member of the academic or administrative faculty. Official publications of the College, however, shall be subject to editorial control by appropriate institutional officers._

<sup><strong>2</strong> </sup>**_Operating Principles of Reed College_**

 _1. The educational mission of the College requires the freest exchange and open discussion of ideas. The use of censorship or intimidation is intolerable in such a community._
