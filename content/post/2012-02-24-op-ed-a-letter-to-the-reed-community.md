Dear Reed Community members,

I write to you today with one request for the sake of our entire community. By now, everyone knows that two students were arrested on the 13th. Because of the antagonistic manner of the media, information about what is affecting our campus right now is splattered across newspapers, with many details incorrect or exaggerated. It’s being connected to past heroin overdoses by Willamette Weekly and the Oregonian. It’s being sensationalized. It’s becoming a fucking mess.

Now, whether you fall on the side of the administration or on the side of Roland Shoemaker ’13 and Manny Abreu ’13, the individuals who were arrested, or if you’re generally apathetic, I have to ask you as a favor from one Reed community member to the community as a whole: _Please_ _stop spreading rumors_. Not everyone has the whole picture yet, and spreading falsehoods is not helping the students involved or the administration deal with this situation.

Why should you respect my request? Because the spreading of rumors is about as dishonorable as one can be. Spreading misinformation is lying, which is something that is specifically spelled out as a huge infraction in the Honor Principle: “The honor principle assumes that members of the community will be honest (not only in their academic work, but in all their behavior), will respect others&#8217; rights and persons, will take responsibility for the effect of their behavior on the college as a whole, and will engage in conscientious self-reflection about their words and deeds” (taken from the guidebook, “the essence of Reed Honor”). Let me give you a brief background as to why I am so invested in this whole situation, and why it is the responsibility of our community to deal with this:

I have known Roland and Manny since they got to Reed the year after I matriculated. We became friends, and they moved into my RCA complex this year. I spent a lot of my time at their apartment, and my roommate and I had them over for Thanksgiving dinner. They are really amazing people; they are hardworking, kind, and supportive of my academic, intellectual, and leisurely pursuits, as well as those of the rest of their friends. Roland passed his history qual, has done myriad independent projects, and has been a loyal employee of CUS for much of his time at Reed. Manny started a literary magazine and has been involved in creative events on campus, as well as working for the language lab. They are great students, respectful peers, and passionate humans. And they both mean the world to me.

Now, wherever you fall on how the arrests came to be and how the administration handled this, you have to understand that this situation is not just affecting Roland and Manny. This is about our community. These two individuals have a lot of friends and acquaintances at this school. This is about their classmates and professors and the staff who know them. Roland and Manny are not just two names. They are part of our community, whether you like it or not. And now that we have reporters infiltrating our campus and bothering students, it is important more than ever to band together as a community.

So, what does this have to do with not spreading rumors? Everything. The honorable thing to do is to not talk about this case if you do not have the full story. And I can tell you, as someone who has been supporting both Roland and Manny and has willingly taken on this living nightmare along with the rest of their friends, most of y’all do not have the full story. And legally, that’s how it has to be. So, seriously, _PLEASE STOP SPREADING RUMORS._ This is an extremely serious issue and by adding misinformation, you are not only hurting those who were arrested, but also those of us who have not turned our backs on our friends. Remember that Roland and Manny are still Reedies, and that, even more importantly, they are human beings. The law is already disciplining them, as is the school; it is not your place to abuse them with falsehoods.

For the sake of honor, Olde Reed, community, and camaraderie, please ask questions and don’t make assumptions. Otherwise, we’re just like every other school that throws our own to the wolves instead of trying to support them through compassion and respect, forgiveness and rehabilitation. We need to rise up as a community based on honor again. Stopping the gossip and rumors is a good first step.

Thank you,

Elizabeth Martin, Class of 2012
