The Undergraduate Research Committee has Initiative Grants available to assist student research and thesis activities. Some examples of eligible expenses include but are not limited to conference travel to present papers, equipment and supplies purchases, and travel to field sites and performances. Proposals are not to exceed five pages in length and should contain a budget. For application forms and further information, please check the web. The funding limit for Initiative Grants is $2,500.

The Committee also has funding for Opportunity Grants. These grants are intended to offset expenses associated with attendance at professional meetings, performances, exhibits, or classes, as well as other opportunities that may present themselves, not necessarily associated with a specific course. A description of the proposed activity, not to exceed one page in length, should be submitted along with a budget. For application forms and further information, please check the web. The funding limit for Opportunity Grants is $1,500. 

Initiative and Opportunity grant applications are accepted and funded on a rolling basis but the next deadline to assure consideration is October 14. Grant applications should be submitted electronically to Susan Buttrick, biology department assistant. If you have questions about either of these programs contact Steve Arch, biology professor and chair, Undergraduate Research Committee, or Susan Buttrick.
