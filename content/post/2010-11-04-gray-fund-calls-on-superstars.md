Reel Big Fish is just the beginning—Common, The Decemberists, Neil Patrick Harris, Modest Mouse are all proposed names for Gray Fund’s coming semesters.

“Every year we try to bring in big names. Relative to the other years, this year, especially with the big music acts, is definitely more of a pop culture type of thing,” says Gray Fund intern April Kaplowitz, in reference to previous guests like writer Sherman Alexie and activist Cleve Jones.

Reel Big Fish, who played at this year’s Harvest Ball, was no exception. “We thought it would be fun to have a throwback to the ska days. It’s something that was really big when I was in high school, and although I’m not that much older than you all, it’s funny to see people being nostalgic for those days,” says Kyle Webster, Assistance Director to Student Services.

For this year’s spring semester, many names have been put on the table. “We’ve been in touch with Common’s people… [he fits] within our budget and sounds like a cool idea,” Webster says. In response to a rumor that Nas is also in the works, Webster responded, “He’s a bit too expensive.”

The Decemberists, Modest Mouse and Neil Patrick Harris have been proposed for next year’s Centennial Celebration. The Gray Fund committee (composed of faculty, staff, students, and interns) is planning this two-hour variety show to be held at Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall next fall. Webster says, “ We’d like to just bus all the students downtown for one fun and memorable evening to celebrate 100 years of Reed and 20 years of Gray Fund.”

The committee’s $2 million endowment annually funds $87,000 for cultural activities and $30,000 towards outdoor trips.

“Betty Gray gave money to Reed to better the lives and create a healthier environment for Reed students. She saw that they needed this social type of environment to relieve some of the stress. I mean, we could use the money to build a new library, but would that really help?” says Kaplowitz. “I see it in myself. We all see it. Getting bogged down by the stress. It’s nice to see all these students crawling out of the library.”

“Gray Fund has very specific rules on how the money can be spent. So when students ask why that money doesn’t go towards scholarships&#8230; it can’t. I think it’s cool because most schools don’t have a large sum of money to getting students off campus and having fun,” Webster says. The Gray Fund mandates student input, and the committee considers suggestions vital. “This fund will exist as long as Reed College exists. So, if you have an idea, give it to us!”
