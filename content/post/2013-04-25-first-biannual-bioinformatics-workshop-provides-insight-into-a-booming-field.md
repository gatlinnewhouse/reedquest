The first biannual bioinformatics and genomics workshop took place at Reed from April 13 to 14. A slate of specialists was invited to lead modules on a wide-array of key topics in whole genome analysis. More than two dozen undergraduates from Reed and Lewis and Clark College had the opportunity to study bioinformatic and genomic analysis at the cutting edge of the field.Â  The workshop consisted of two nine-hour training days in bioinformatics and genomics tools, techniques, and analysis.

The workshop kicked off Friday evening, April 12, with a keynote address from Penn State&#8217;s Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Anton Nekrutenko. Nekrutenko is a pioneering bioinformaticist and talked about the importance of accessibility and reproducibility in scientific research, especially in the information age. His talk was free and open to the public, and over 100 people attended from institutions across the city of Portland and the state of Oregon.

The workshop was organized by Assistant Professor of Biology Sarah Schaack and was sponsored and funded by the Reed College Department of Biology, Lewis & Clark College, the National Science Foundation, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Workshops of this nature can cost participants many hundreds of dollars, but here participation was free. Undergraduates from Reed and Lewis & Clark College were given early registration access and all the spots were filled. In total, people from 11 institutions participated in the weekend, including students, recent grads, and faculty from five universities.

Bioinformatics in a relatively new field and rapid advances in technology means that there are very few texts to teach from. Pedagogically, bioinformatics must be learned through practice. &#8220;The workshop was a really great experience. The lectures and the modules were very interesting. We all left with many more practical skills relating to our shared interest, &#8221; says Joshua Gancher &#8217;16.
