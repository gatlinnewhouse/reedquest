Like countless other sports gatherings, the snacks were plentiful and the bros outnumbered the ladies. Armchair athletes weighed in on which team was favored and what strategies would carry them to victory. While the premise is so familiar, the sport on display, or eSport, as it’s known, was League of Legends.

League of Legends, or LoL is a free-to-play team-based game where players control a Champion. The goal is to destroy the other team’s Nexus located at the other side of an arena. The five champions from either side must navigate an arena riddled with turrets, minions, monsters and enemy champions. The champions grow in power as they fight, leveling up and buying items as they seek to overwhelm the opposing teams defenses.

At face value, it may seem incorrigibly nerdy to gather around to watch other people play video games on a Friday night, but the LoL finals showed off a new reality of entertainment. The finals weren’t held in your mother’s basement, but at the Staples Center, the biggest entertainment venue in Los Angeles. Legions of fans cheered an opening performance that featured Crystal Method, cellist Tina Luo dressed like the chick in bloodrayne, and Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland clad in a getup that was a mix between the phantom of the opera and glowing EDM battle armor.

The performance was over the top. “This is bizarre,” said someone to my left. “This is awesome,” said someone to my right. The two teams that would play the finals, SK Telecom from Korea and Royal Club from China were elevated up to the stage through a trapdoor amidst the mist of a fog machine. The half-capacity crowd in Psych 105 cheered and heckled as the matches got underway, with the video game projected across the wall.

The combat in LoL is typical fare only for those raised on a diet of Dragonball Z and Warcraft III. Spell-slinging babes clad in chain mail bikinis send lightning bolts at teleporting ninjas. Hulking, drunken brawlers lob exploding barrels at demonic spider thingies. A rabbit riding a steam punk hovercraft mows down streams of NPC minions. The announcers’ voices race to stay on top of the action à la any other professional sporting event. The scene is surprisingly riveting.

In recent years, video games have started getting mainstream respect in the entertainment industry. More and more people are making careers out of playing video games, many streaming their games live on Twitch, which builds a solid amount of income if enough viewers tune in. Riot Games, the parent company of League of Legends, had a 5 million dollar prize purse distributed across this year’s championship series. The winning team of the finals, SK Telecom, walked away with $200,000 apiece in prize money alone, which does not include sponsorship deals that they will likely receive from video game and hardware companies.

League of Legends is the worlds biggest eSport. According to data gathered by Riot Games, 32 million unique users play LoL every month. 12 million different people play LoL every single day. The player base is 90% male and 60% have attended or are attending college.

Still, in a world where our friends are found in online lists, the life of a video gamer can be one of loneliness. Though players are interacting with others online, they are often doing so while sitting alone at a computer. Sophomore Varchas Gopalaswamy, an irreverent Tir Na Nog inhabitant, took a stab at changing this. He moved his video game playing from his dorm room to the common room of Woodbridge, bringing an Ethernet splitter with him. Frequently there would be upwards of 8 people all playing LoL at the same time. Soon Alt The Dragon was born, an organized gathering that gets together to watch and play video games. “I don’t think playing video games is any different than any other hobby. It’s a fun social activity. It’s not for everyone, but if you put in the time, it’s just as entertaining as any other sport.” said Varchas.

Varchas also has ambitions for the future of LoL at Reed “I would ideally like to have a regular tournament for people here at Reed, but that completely depends on participation,” he said.

The finals ended in a clean sweep, the Korean team obliterating China three games to nil. The cheers that emanated from Psych 105 and from the Staples Center foretell an era when being the best player in the world at particular video game will lead to far more fame than it does in our present day.
