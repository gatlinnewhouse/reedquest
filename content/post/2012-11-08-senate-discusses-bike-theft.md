Junior Andrew Watson got a bike for his birthday last April—but he didn&#8217;t get to keep it long. He says the gift was recently stolen from behind Eliot Hall, where he had locked it. He is concerned that there is not enough to prevent thieves from stealing bikes on campus.

“There&#8217;s no actual impetus for someone on campus to not come and take my property right now,” he told Senate last week.

Director of Community Safety says it&#8217;s impossible to prevent bike theft, now that thieves can break through U-locks as easily as cable locks with a handheld drill and an attachment that can all fit in a backpack. Last academic year saw a 77% increase of bike thefts over the previous year, with a total of 55.

Granger told Senate there was no easy solution. An indoor bike storage area would require construction that would impact campus. When Senate recommended fake surveillance to deter potential thieves, Granger explained that the public safety profession had largely abandoned such measures as they gave community members a false sense of security that encouraged careless behavior.

There is not enough indoor bike storage for every student to keep their bike, Steve Yeadon, maintenance manager of Facilities Services, told _The Quest_ earlier this semester. “For our foreseeable future I don’t see a bunch of outdoor bike storage units popping up on campus,” he said.

Granger did point out that students living off campus have access to The Grove&#8217;s indoor bike-storage area, which Watson, who lives off campus, said he was not aware of. Increased awareness of such existing resources could help students avoid theft, said Granger.
