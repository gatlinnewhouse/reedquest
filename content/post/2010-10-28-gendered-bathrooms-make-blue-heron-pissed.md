We’re pissed.

How many times a day do you use a restroom in a public building on campus? Twice? Three times? Every time you do, you are forced to identify yourself as either male or female in order to take care of essential bodily functions. For most of us, this choice is easy, but for those of us who do not fall into either category of “male” or “female,” or who are not easily identified by others as clearly either gender, this can lead to harassment for making the “wrong” choice. Often, people are forced to walk across campus to get to a bathroom they feel safe and comfortable using. Defending heteronormative ideas of two distinct genders is harmful and oppressive because everyone is not accommodated by male and female restrooms.

We, the Blue Heron Collective, want a campus with one gender-neutral bathroom in every administrative, student, and academic space. Gender-neutral restrooms in dormitories are a start, and show that they work in our community. However, they are not enough. Nobody should have to leave the building they are in to use a restroom. The lack of gender-neutral restrooms in public spaces is not merely a matter of “political correctness” but of actual harm and human dignity. We are concerned that members of the Reed community and visitors to the campus may feel unwelcome and uneasy when forced to fit into a gender binary in order to do something as basic as urinate. How can the Reed student body call itself socially progressive when most of our public restrooms are gendered?

We recognize that women-only spaces like restrooms can function as default safe spaces, but there is not a zero-sum game between safe spaces for cis-women and dignity for gender non-conforming and trans people. There is no contradiction in fighting patriarchy, rape culture, and heteronormativity—the erroneous idea that there are two and only two genders with certain prescribed roles—simultaneously. To have buildings that only contain male and female restrooms is to reinforce gender essentialist ideas that support sexism.

We are not proposing that all bathrooms on campus become gender neutral. However, we are proposing that there be space for people of all genders to fulfill their basic needs in whatever building they find themselves in on campus. We must fight sexual assault on campus while rejecting sexist arguments against gender-inclusive spaces. The idea that men as a group will be unable to control their sexual urges, simply by virtue of being in a restroom with other genders in a public building, is obviously false. We place great importance on safety from sexual assault at Reed, but also understand that the absence of gender inclusive spaces is not a solution to this problem.

The Blue Heron Collective is undertaking this campaign as community members who are concerned about what we see as a significant injustice. By publishing this, we hope to open a community-wide conversation on a topic that ultimately affects all of us. We do not speak for trans or gender non-conforming people or for any other group or community. We only speak for ourselves.

That being said, we hope not to be the only voice in this conversation. We hope to bring a proposal in support of campus-wide gender-neutral restrooms Senate next week, but this is one very limited space for dialogue on this issue. In order for a change to occur, community norms and perceptions of gender will need to change. We encourage all community members to discuss this topic openly and hope that you will speak up and take action to create space that everyone will feel safe in, regardless of their adherence to a gender binary. We further hope that the community considers not just the specific issue of public restrooms at Reed, but also questions and assumptions about gender, sex, and the gender binary. For a significant period in Reed history, restrooms in public areas were gender neutral. We need to change them back and restore the freedom to name one’s own gender identity.
