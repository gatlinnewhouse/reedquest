Reed celebrates its centennial this weekend with multiple events around campus, including the dedication of the restored orchard, a student-body-initiated project that has been in the works for several years. President Diver will give a short speech and help plant a “centennial tree” at the event, which will also include a bluegrass band, tabling by student organizations, and a bicycle-powered cider press.

The orchard restoration, which has taken place over the course of the last year, was decided upon in 2008 as a project students could complete for the Centennial. Starting in October 2006, Student Activities director Kristin Holmberg began taking input from the student body on ideas for a project that would serve as a lasting contribution to the college. In January 2008, a town hall meeting on the Centennial celebration, which included continued discussion of the student project, took place. Holmberg then took a survey of the ideas generated there.

Canyon Guru Zac Perry notes that the project “has been a collaborative effort between many departments and student groups.” He foresees that the Orchard will come to serve many functions in the community, including as a space for lectures and informal meetings, as well as “a learning resource for those with an interest in small-scale farming and orchard management.” Perry ****hopes that student groups will take over future maintenance of the orchard and encourages both groups and individuals to contact him for training.

Perry supervised most of the restoration, which included Canyon Crew ****pruning the largely neglected trees already at the site, as well as students planting numerous young trees—including persimmon, fig, and several varieties of plum, pear, and apple—on Canyon Day in Spring 2011. According to Perry, species were selected based on the level of maintenance they will require and their suitability for Portland&#8217;s climate; peaches, for instance, were ruled out because they are prone to fungus problems in the valley&#8217;s wet spring season.

Other ideas at the time of the student survey included the institution of a new annual celebration, restoring the natural springs near the Grove, and, controversially, a renovation of the SU. ****The orchard restoration, however, emerged as the most popular idea, especially given that the community garden had just been removed to make room for the Grove.

Holmberg believes ****that the Orchard restoration has gone above and beyond what students voted for four years ago. Current students, she notes, are more in touch with ideas of home gardening and sustainable food, which she calls an “even more authentic reason” for the restoration than the initial frustration over the removal of the community gardens. “I do think it matches people&#8217;s expectations,” Holmberg says, for a natural, productive space that can be used for informal gatherings or quiet contemplation. From the initial vote on the project, to the restoration, to the planning of the dedication itself, she concludes, “it&#8217;s truly a student project.”
