  <em>Students listen to The Flaming Lips&#8217; </em>Zaireeka<em> in the Student Union.</em>
</p>

Things got loud this weekend when two of indie rock’s biggest and most-loved bands descended upon the Student Union—in recording, that is. First, on Friday night, students had the opportunity to dance themselves clean at _This Is Happening_, a dance to LCD Soundsystem’s last concert. Then, at the opposite end of the weekend, a group of students put on a listening party for the Flaming Lips’ 1997 4-disc experimental album _Zaireeka_.

_This Is Happening_, taking its name from LCD Soundsystem’s final album, is a first-time event organized by Darci Kovacs and Michael Zhao that took form after making Top 40. The event was possible after the summer release of the documentary Shut Up and Play the Hits, which chronicled LCD Soundsystem’s final concert and how James Murphy, the mastermind behind the band, dealt with breaking up the group on his own terms. Even more importantly, the DVD release of the movie included the three-and-a-half hour long concert in its entirety, which lends itself perfectly to, say, a Friday night dance in the Student Union.

The event itself began slow, with a scantily-attended showing of the documentary. However, people began pouring in as soon as the actual concert film began. By the time that hits like &#8220;All My Friends&#8221; and &#8220;Daft Punk is Playing at My House&#8221; were being blasted onto all four walls of the SU, the building was a steamy, sweaty full house. The real spectacle began, though, when LCD Soundsystem’s arguably biggest hit, ‘Dance Yourself Clean’ came on. As the musical drop edged closer and closer, dancers looked up, knowing what would happen: The balloon drop. When those white balloons finally fell, the crowd erupted into a cheer that seemed to signal one thing: _This Is Happening_ might just stick around and happen again.

**Flaming Lips rage on four disks**

“I really want people who complain about the loss of Olde Reed to take their frustration and channel it into the creation of a freakier, more radical institution,” says Jordan Horowitz, who organized the _Zaireeka_ listening party last Sunday. “It might be futile in the end but as Dylan Thomas said, it&#8217;s better to ‘rage, rage against the dying of the light.’”

Horowitz reports that he had been harboring the idea of having the listening party since 2008, and that he had planned for it to take place during Renn Fayre. It was not until a few weeks ago that Horowitz attempted to revive the idea by putting a listing in an SB Info email to gauge interest. After receiving emails that expressed enthusiasm for the _Zaireeka_ event, Horowitz began planning the Oct. 28 event. The date of the event coincided with the 15th anniversary of its release in 1997.

_Zaireeka_ was released by The Flaming Lips as four separate CDs that are meant to be played simultaneously. Each of the album’s eight songs exist on four tracks. These tracks harmonize and interact with each other to create a record encompassing the subject matter of “metamorphosing baby bugs, the metaphysics of menstruation and a symphony played by the universe itself,” according to Horowitz. For this reason, the listening party required a very specific set-up. Four stereo systems were placed in the four corners of the Student Union, manned by members of the Sound Kollectiv. After a countdown in order to synchronize the discs, the album began.

The record was accompanied by a light show, glow sticks, and bubbles. Approximately 40 people were in attendance, lying on couches, sprawled across the floor, and circling the room. Jade Novarino, who calls this her “fourth _Zaireeka_,” aided Horowitz in organizing last Sunday’s listening party. Novarino compared the event to rereading a book, stating that “every time is really different.” She says that watching people listen to the record is her favorite part of the event. “As much as we were all in the same space, we were all in really different spaces,” which Novarino could see as she watched the listeners engage with the record. Novarino also says that she hopes and intends for _Zaireeka_ to become a Reed tradition.
