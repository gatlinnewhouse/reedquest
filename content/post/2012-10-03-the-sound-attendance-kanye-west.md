**Kanye West**: _Good Music Cruel Summer_ G.O.O.D. Music Label [COLLAB-O-RAP]

If you’re in need of a conversation starter this week, you’re in luck because a new Kanye West release just came out. You can pretty much guarantee that that information will find eager ears, and will grant you the power to make anyone with in shouting distance go reaching for their headphones. The album, West’s seventh studio attempt, is a screwdriver full of collaborations with the royal haunches of Pusha T, Common, John Legend, Big Sean, and Raekwon, all signed to his record label G.O.O.D. Music since its 2004 inauguration. _Good Music Cruel Summer_ is filled with classic Kanye West beats that are steamy and perfectly textured like a of bowl of mashed potatoes waiting for their lyrical gravy. West put the best songs first on the album, with “To the World” providing an uplifting opening, followed by the innuendo gold-medalist “Clique.” “Mercy” swings with the slickest beats for bumping in your ride, while “New God Flow” rings with the most vengeful, activating lyrics. The last three songs on the album are less appealing from most angles, but still perfectionistic bastions of texture and lyrics. While the label’s pretty ponies dominate the album, it’s a sweet payoff to hear West’s addition to each song. On some he ascends into only a few verses, though they are usually among the best on the track. Looks like West has bestowed America with another hype-worthy album, and further evidence of his prowess as a label suit.
