**Announcements**

A total of ten applications were received for the position of Student Sustainability Coordinator, from which Dove Henry ’14 was chosen. The position of editor for the senior yearbook, the Griffin, was given to Natasha Lelchuk ’15.

Student Body Vice President Paul Messick reported that the SIN code is still in the process of being rewritten. As a result, paper ballots will be used once again in the upcoming student body election instead of electronic voting. Messick did not express concern: “Turnout was pretty fly last time.”

According to Student Body President Ari Galper, the Paideia survey he sent out last weekend received about 250 student responses, which he said is “pretty solid.” The survey is still open, and will aid the ad hoc Paideia committee in their discussion on the future of Paideia.

Senator Alden Jones reported that there are more Renn Fayre structures in the process of being made than there were last year.

Three new murals will decorate campus within the next year, with the goal of being completed over the summer. Tessa Hulls&#8217;s &#8217;07 mural in the upper GCC will be replaced by the work of Santiago Leyba, a senior art major, and the mural depicting Contras killing victim [Ben Linder][1], in the lower GCC will be replaced with a mural by Maria Maita-Keppeler. For the first time, Café Paradiso will be decorated with a mural, which will be done by Austen Weymueller.

**Smoking Citations**

After the Multnomah County health inspector returned to campus this past week, Reed was cited for violating state smoking laws. Director of Student Activities Kristin Holmberg said that the case is going to the state, after which it will be clear whether or not Reed will be fined. Still, Holmberg said that the inspector “loved” the new look of the Pool Hall, thanks to the cleaning led by Pool Hall manager Molly Kimball. Holmberg also reported that the inspector considers the breezeway between the Biology Building and the Library as a non-smoking space, because it has three walls and a ceiling. The area under the dome is also considered a non-smoking space.

**Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy**

Dean of Student Services Mike Brody said a new draft of the Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy would be sent to Senate this weekend. Brody asked Senate to vote on the policy no later than April 19.

Senator David Azrael said that, before Senate votes, “it is important to give it to our constituency. It would be nice to have people potentially look at it.”

**Roll Over in Student Body Funds**

When student groups do not use all of the money allocated to them for a particular purpose, their money rolls over to the next semester. Senator Paul Messick made a general proposal to change this policy, so that unused funds would not roll over between spring and fall semesters, unless for a specific circumstance. Instead, unused money would go back into the general Student Body Fund at the end of each spring semester.

Messick cited this proposed change as a way to, “better use the money we have.” The purpose of the change in policy would be to keep Student Body Funds available for use.

“There is one purpose for Student Body Funds, and that is to spend them,” Azrael said.

Senator Annam Swanson added that student groups could ask for funds again.

**Student Body Endowment**

Helen Spencer-Wallace inquired on behalf of Greenboard where Reed’s student body endowment is invested. She reported that Vice President and Treasurer Ed McFarlane said investment is confidential. She also asked, citing a Student Body Handbook reference on the issue, if the student body has full control over its endowment.

Galper replied that the student body does not have control over its endowment, but that it is handled in the same way as the college’s endowment.

“It is in the same pot. We just keep track of what our part is,” Galper said.

Azrael said that Greenboard should have specific suggestions as to where the endowment should be invested instead if divestment were to happen.
