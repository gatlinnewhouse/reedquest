    Francois Vigneault&#8217;s &#8217;13 thesis: “Wow! That’s the Stuff Comics Are Made of”: Traditional Comic Book Structures in Jaime Hernandez’s Locas.

_Editor&#8217;s note: This article was originally published with Francois&#8217; previous name Francois Paultre, but has been updated to reflect his new name. _

Two bisexual Latina girls, named Maggie and Hopey, lie together in bed. It&#8217;s 1982, and the two eighteen-year-old girls are part of the California punk-rock scene. Suddenly, Maggie needs to leave for her job repairing rocket ships.

This is the first strip of Jaime Hernandez&#8217;s comic series _Locas_, which details the relationship of Maggie, Hopey, and their constellation of friends and acquaintances. Thirty years later, Hernandez still publishes _Locas_ (which is Spanish for &#8220;crazy women&#8221;) in the serial comic book _Love and Rockets_, which he puts out independently with his brothers, Mario and Gilbert. Unlike most comics, however, the main characters don&#8217;t exist in a timeless world of eternal youth; they have grown in real time, but their forty-eight-year lives, riddled with questions about punk rock music, Mexican-American identity, and bisexuality, are still intertwined.

Hernandez&#8217;s thirty-year comic strip is the subject of Francois Vigneault&#8217;s &#8217;13 English thesis, which he is working on with his advisor, Professor Gail Sherman. Vigneault, of San Francisco, California, started reading the comic around 1993, when he was a teenager. After almost twenty years, Vigneault still reads the comic book, but now he reads it through a more analytical lens. For his thesis, Vigneault is examining how elements of _Locas_ are shared with traditional comics, like _X-Men_. He says that the cumulative, continuous stream of _Locas_ is reminiscent of superhero comics, whose individual strips gain importance from &#8220;the memories of what you&#8217;ve read before.&#8221;

For instance, Vigneault explains that the comic series starts out with science fiction elements (like Maggie&#8217;s occupation repairing pro-solar rockets) but gradually loses all mention of science fiction. Lately, however, the science fiction elements have resurfaced. &#8220;Imagine if there were sci-fi elements at the beginning of &#8216;The Sopranos,&#8217; then they were gone for twenty seasons, and then the sci-fi elements came back. There&#8217;s a lot of weird recurrence,&#8221; explains Vigneault.

&#8220;[Hernandez&#8217;s] are the same stories over time, for 30 years, over thousands of pages. That&#8217;s a traditional comic book structure.&#8221;

Vigneault chose to write about _Locas_ after considering writing about traditional literature, like that of James Joyce. &#8220;Originally, I wasn&#8217;t going to write about a comic at all,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;but some other students planted that seed in my mind&#8211;that I could write about a comic book.&#8221; Vigneault, who is a comic book artist himself, says he chose to study Hernandez&#8217;s Locas series because of its originality and personal appeal. Explains Vigneault: “[Hernandez] had a huge influence on my work–both my style of writing and my style of art. He&#8217;s also not written about from an academic perspective.”
