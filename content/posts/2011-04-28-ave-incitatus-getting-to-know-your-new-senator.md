You may have noticed in this semester’s election results that the new senators include an individual of a curiously equine complexion: “Incitatus.”  Who, you may ask, is this dark horse candidate that has so brilliantly triumphed? Rumor has it that Incitatus is actually Francis Dieterle, but this is false.  Mr. Dieterle is merely Incitatus’s servant and spokesman.  The truth is to be found in one of Incitatus’s campaign posters: You can’t beat a dead horse.

Some historical background is in order.  Incitatus was the favorite horse of Emperor Caligula of Rome, whom you may remember from Hum 110.  Perhaps to display his contempt for the Senators, or perhaps because of his own doubtful mental faculties, Caligula made Incitatus a member of the Roman Senate.  He kept Incitatus in a luxurious stable made of marble, surrounded by servants, and had gold mixed into Incitatus’s feed.  Some say that Caligula planned to make Incitatus a consul.

But, you may ask, what inspired Incitatus to run in Reed’s student body election? What made him attempt to win, by merit, an office that he had previously held by appointment? Surely there is no precedent for such a campaign by an ungulate-American?

In fact, Incitatus was inspired by an election in recent American history: the presidential election of 1968.  In this election, the Yippie Party nominated Pigasus, the first porcine candidate for president, with the slogan: “They nominate a president and he eats the people.  We nominate a president and the people eat him.”  Although Pigasus went down in defeat to Richard Nixon, his groundbreaking candidacy galvanized Incitatus to consider entering electoral politics.

Incitatus was easily able to gather the signatures necessary for ballot placement in less than half an hour.

However, at elections assembly on Thursday the 14th, Incitatus was unable to deliver an oration, due to his fright of the small door to the Student Union.  Instead, Mr. Dieterle spoke on his behalf, reading Cicero’s brilliant “First Oration against Catiline.”  All present were electrified by the hard-hitting rhetoric denouncing senatorial corruption, which Dieterle delivered in passionate oratory style, and the crowd rose to a standing ovation at the end.  After this wildly successful speech, many foresaw Incitatus’s election to the student senate.

Although Incitatus has decided to start small, his ambitions are by no means limited to Reed’s student senate.  He envisions the conquest of Greater Eastmoreland, upon which he will impose a “burdensome grain tax” to fill Reed’s coffers and enrich the student body.  He also plans the creation of a new aqueduct, to be accomplished with the aid of DxOxTxUx and to be constructed out of couches.  As for the Praetorian Guard, Incitatus has pledged to ensure that they cease interrupting student revelry.

Besides these small projects, Incitatus plans to reform the Reed student body’s system of government.

Gladiatorial combat is widely recognized as the most appropriate means of solving disputes, Incitatus argues, and he promises to work to bring Reed College into the modern age.  He told the Quest that he believes the Honor Process should be overhauled to mandate, in place of formal mediation, fights between gladiators hired by the disputants.  This will require the construction of a ring for gladiatorial combat in front of Eliot Hall, as well as the transformation of Honor Council into a resource to help students hire the gladiators that are right for them.  Commenting on Incitatus’s plan, Honor Council member Brian Moore stated, “We on Honor Council are excited to work with Incitatus to bridge the duality between the discursive and physical spheres within the Honor Process.”

In the longer term, Incitatus expresses a hope for the institution of a permanent senatorial class, as well as a hope that student body voting will be restricted to the election of two student tribunes with limited veto power.  He points out that this would not be a very major change, seeing as only about 30% of the student body voted in the most recent elections.  The Reed Empire might eventually expand to include the wealthy kingdom of Hawthorne or barbarian lands such as Lewis and Clark.

In closing, Incitatus requests that you order your servant to pour you another glass of wine, so that you may toast: Senatus Populusque Reedianus!
