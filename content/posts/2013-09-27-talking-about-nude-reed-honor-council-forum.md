A multitude of individuals from all corners of the Reed community converged in Vollum Lounge last Thursday, Sept. 19, to engage in a discussion sponsored by Honor Council on Nudity, Tradition, and Title IX. This was the first time that the entire community has had an opportunity to ask their questions, voice their opinions, and air their grievances about the recent events leading up to and resulting from the Title IX complaint in a public forum. As to be expected from the Reed public, plenty of strong thoughts and mindful observations were shared. Perhaps the biggest news to come out of the forum, though, were the changes already being made to certain Reed traditions, like the Hum 110 Pantheon and Humplay.

The meeting started with some introductory remarks by Honor Council member Roman Garcia, and Mike Brody, Dean of Students, followed with some statements on how the community should be handling the Title IX complaint. “I’ve heard people saying that, by making a Title IX complaint, this person is making an affront to the Honor Principle,” Brody said. “It would be totally consistent with the Honor Principle to offer venues of comfort and healing outside of confronting the offender… Title IX is an outgrowth of the Honor Principle.”

With this established, the conversation turned from questioning the validity of the Title IX complaint, which Honor Council made clear is not the purpose of the discussion, to the other end of the issue, the so called “gesticulators.”

The first person to voice his opinion was Dean Schmeltz, who is a former HumPlay director and who was involved in the organization of the Pantheon the previous two years. “I walked by as the Pantheon was going on,” Schmeltz said, “I don’t think it was a good showing this year… It should be a welcoming, not a harmful, greeting to Reed.”

A bit later, Mike Sommer, current HumPlay director and involved in this year’s Pantheon, answered by saying, “We are working on measures to stop aggressive behaviors.” As the meeting went on, details on these “measures” began coming out. One of these is the reinvention of the HumPlay Handbook, which previously only contained previous years’ scripts. In the new HumPlay Handbook, created by HumPlay directors and actors past and present, guidelines for conduct will be detailed for the numerous events that HumPlay is involved with, such as the Pantheon, Noize Parade, and, of course, HumPlay. These guidelines will be written in hope that future organizers will know the general boundaries that they should follow during these events.

The greatest bombshell had not been dropped yet, though. Elaine Andersen, another current HumPlay director, said, “We are already planning that no one will be nude in next year’s Pantheon.”

Interspersed with this discussion was another impassioned conversation on whether nudity is really the issue at the center of the forum. Junior Ariana Remmel provided the account of a nudist, saying, “Nudity has already been described at this forum as a momentary freedom. For some people, it is not a momentary freedom, but a lifestyle. The naked people on campus come to Reed to feel safe and at home.” Many people voiced similar opinions, concerned that nudity would be equated with negative behavior, even harassment.

One of the most interesting voices during the discussion was Alex ’07, who distinguished himself as the writer of the “Amanda Reed Must Die!” script, used at Noize Parade for years since. He outlined a timeline of his involvement in welcoming activities, Noize Parade in particular, saying that the first year that he did Noize Parade in 2005, many of the people acting out the skit were naked, and that scared away many freshmen. The next year, he made the artistic choice for the actors to wear underwear, in order to be inclusive of more people. “Any tradition that makes people uncomfortable,” he said, “shouldn’t be a tradition at all.”

While no distinct conclusions were reached during the Honor Council Forum, many left Vollum Lounge feeling more informed and enlightened to a variety of viewpoints on nudity, sexual harassment, and the nature of tradition. Like many controversies that have rocked the Reed community, this is not something that can be solved in a single two-hour session. It is apparent, however, that these sessions are beneficial in the way that they disseminate information, allow a public outlet for honorable discussion, and give us Nü (and Nude) Reedies a contact point with the opinions and viewpoints of Olde(r) Reed.
