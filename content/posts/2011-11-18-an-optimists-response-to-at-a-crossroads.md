I know this is a little late in the semester, and that the article that prompted this unfortunately belated response may have already faded totally from our collective consciousness, but I felt that Lev Navarre&#8217;s [piece in the October 6 issue of The Quest][1] was one of the more deeply troubling things I&#8217;ve read in our glorious student newspaper over the past three years. Because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone, I thought it would be worth beginning a conversation about some of the ideas presented in his article as fact—namely, that it seems as though Mr. Navarre&#8217;s piece proceeds from the premise that sexual assault is inextricably linked to certain basic facts of human sexuality. With this concept fixed in place, but conveniently never directly addressed, the article seems to imply that the issue at hand isn&#8217;t that we should work to deter sexual assault, it&#8217;s that people at Reed just don&#8217;t really understand what sexual assault is or isn&#8217;t—or who should be held accountable for it.

Through his problematization of the idea that there is someone to blame for cases of sexual assault, Mr. Lavarre reaffirms the myth that a sexual assault survivor should somehow share the blame for his or her assault, which is both harmful and insulting to our intelligent and caring community. I&#8217;m not sure that there is ever a &#8220;simple&#8221; sexual assault case at Reed, where an assignation of guilt and sanctions will be reached context-free and without the input of the survivor, so it&#8217;s hard to know what to make of Mr. Navarre&#8217;s assertion that an approach that doesn&#8217;t treat a survivor as partially guilty somehow &#8220;fails&#8221; them.

The alternative, bizarrely presented as almost the only alternative, and an &#8220;organic&#8221; rather than &#8220;systemic&#8221; solution, is apparently &#8220;changing our sexual norms in an honest way.&#8221; I&#8217;m not entirely sure what this is supposed to mean (I would be interested in clarification), but the idea that sexual assault is unfortunate but inevitable is totally unacceptable to me. Sexual assault is a systemic problem, so why is it inappropriate to respond to it systemically?

By asserting that &#8220;grappling with the idea of consent and being okay with undefined yet communicable standards—that&#8217;s something I think our community can do,&#8221; I think Mr. Navarre grossly undersells the capacity and the capability of this student body. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a place for discussion in sexuality, but rather that it should precede sex, instead of following it. Furthermore, I would argue that defining consent on an &#8220;I know it when I see it&#8221; basis only puts more people in danger, as an individual committing an assault unintentionally is still a danger to our community until their behavior has been addressed. Also, I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable with the idea of re-integrating a sex offender into our community, and I&#8217;m damn sure that if that happens, its priority should be below that of the survivor&#8217;s comfort.

My final objection, and perhaps my most stringent: Mr. Navarre, as males, neither you nor I face the kind of immediate danger that confronts female-identifying people, and statistically, we are much less likely to be raped. As men, I feel as though our position, and our comfort, isn&#8217;t what this system should be primarily designed to address.

What do I want this article to achieve? Honestly, more than anything, I&#8217;d like to find out I&#8217;m wrong in my interpretation of your article. I&#8217;d like for the intention of the article not to have been to perpetuate these shitty standards of rapist reprieve, and that the nuance of the argument was omitted due to space or time limitations. However, I&#8217;ll settle for making sure that you&#8217;re questioning your assertions about this important topic more carefully the next time you publish them.
