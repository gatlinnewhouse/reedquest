Last week’s issue of the Quest showed images from two hundred volumes of Reed College’s free press. If anything, the image spread demonstrates that the Quest has always been there—always—to highlight stories, present perspectives, and propagate information in a fair and creative way.

However, the spread also demonstrated a legacy of imperfection that holds true for the current Quest Board. We have certainly made mistakes; sometimes content falls through at 2am on production night, and we decide to print a stupid coloring sheet in a scramble to fill two pages worth of content. Yes, we fuck up. What we do not do, though, is censor the voice of the student body.

Since the Quest’s inception, the means for news distribution has expanded. No longer can a weekly newspaper quench a community’s desire for information, especially a community as passionate and often controversial as Reed. Hoping to accomplish this, last semester’s Board—of which your three current Queditors were a part—launched ReedQuest.org: a place where editorial can be accessed immediately, but more importantly, a place where dialogue can occur in real-time and be viewed by the community at large.

In creating a website, we sought to create a forum for dialogue. This led us to believe that the best way to present long-form opinion pieces—especially on an issue as pressing and controversial as sexual assault—was in online form. Under this model of publishing, opinion would still be present in print, but in the form of news, so as to not give one single voice the commodity that is print space. The Quest firmly believes that a newspaper is most effective if it presents stories that reveal all layers of a story and all sides of the information. With this in mind, our primary goal in making the decision not to publish long-form editorials, indeed, make like a newspaper and attempt to present pressing issues in the form of news.

Recent controversy over our publishing guidelines has proven that the internet can be a very effective medium for dialogue within the student body. But despite our intentions, there has been some controversy surrounding our decision to place Alex Cherin’s editorial, “On Sexual Assault and Alcohol Consumption,” on our website without including it in the print edition. We stand by this decision, but regret not communicating our policy more effectively to the student body and running an announcement in print encouraging people to join the debate.

However, the idea that placing an article online is some sort of de facto censorship is absurd. Being online makes the article available to an infinitely larger audience. As to why Alex’s editorial couldn’t have run in print in addition to being featured on the website: the piece did not adhere to our print guidelines. Why have such print guidelines? We strongly believe that the website is a better medium for these pieces. Though we have made a number of exceptions to these guidelines in the past – Isabel Manley’s resignation letter and Miles Jochem’s “Heroin, Honor & Reed’s Relationship with Portland” come to mind – we felt that these editorials both had qualities meriting such an exception. And that cannot be considered anything but an editorial decision.

We were democratically elected to edit a newspaper; this entails using our discretion and making editorial decisions about what to and not to print each week. If there are serious concerns about our decision making process, please email us* or stop by our office on Tuesday nights. If we’re unable to quell your concerns, then maybe a recall is in order.

Moving into the future, it is important to clear up misconceptions about our policy regarding editorials. It is not the case that all any and all op-eds regarding sexual assault will be published solely on our website – this was a matter of miscommunication within the Quest Board. In the future, though, we will reserve editorial space for well-written pieces within the prescribed word limit or those exceptional pieces that merit an exception. As always, all submissions will be made available at ReedQuest.org pending the author’s permission.

Ultimately, we believe news reporting is the best way to consolidate and present both the facts of the situation and the opinions of Reed community members. We apologize for the delay in such coverage, but urge you to read what we’ve put together pertaining to the debate on pages two and six.

*With respect to allegations that we don’t check the Quest inbox, allow me to say this: the Quest inbox does get spammed pretty heavily and sometimes we do accidentally overlook messages. We apologize about this.
