Peter Steinberger discussed his understanding of the Honor Principle last Wednesday as part of a series of talks sponsored by the Honor Council. Steinberger’s grim phrasing gave the discussion an absolutist flavor that is often absent in discussions about the Honor Principle. He was comfortable defining the Honor Principle, which some consider too subjective for definition. But Steinberger also asserted that the questions of whether Reed should have an Honor Principle and how it should be applied were both too subjective for analysis.

Steinberger described the Honor Principle as a “doctrine of un-freedom” under which its adherents have no freedoms and no rights. In what seemed to be purposeful abuse of homonyms, he contrasted having rights with doing what is right. Steinberger claimed that Reedies sacrifice the former to strive for the latter. Everything, he said, must be subject to judgment within a “system of virtue ethics” that is defined not by precedent, but by a communal attitude. According to Steinberger, because this system is fragile, the Honor Principle “presupposes a community inclined to honorable behavior” and “interested in self-restraint and self-legislation.”

Steinberger’s claim, “an excess of judgment is the death of the Honor Principle, and a deficiency of judgment is the death of the Honor Principle,” prompted discourse on how to make confrontations about the Honor Principle a more natural choice in difficult situations. Steinberger called maintenance of the Honor Principle a “Sisyphean effort” in which all Reed community members are obligated to participate. Many students agreed that discussing the Honor Principle is the best way to encourage its application.

During a discussion period, some students suggested a hidden role of the Honor Principle. They proposed that the honor process was a way for the school’s administration to control policies while maintaining a semblance of student self-government. Few present at the talk seemed interested in this interpretation, but Steinberger drew that suggestion back to one of his arguments. According to Steinberger, Reedies are bound by state and federal laws under the Honor Principle. He used the newest iteration of the AOD policy as an example. Steinberger also countered the suggestion that student government at Reed is a tool of the administration, asserting that the AOD policy at Reed “would not have been what Colin Diver would have written on his own,” and emphasized student involvement in its creation.

The honor talk generated discourse about the Honor Principle, and the Honor Council hopes that their monthly talks will continue to do so. Steinberger said of the Honor Principle that “the whole thing relies on an ethos of moral analysis,” which honor talks nurture. He claimed that the Honor Principle presupposes that humans strive to do good, and that it obligates the community to have “the capacity and inclination for conversations about honor.”
