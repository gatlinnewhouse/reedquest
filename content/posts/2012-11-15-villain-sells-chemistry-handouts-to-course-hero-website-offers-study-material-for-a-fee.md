Members of the Chemistry department discovered early September that their class materials were being offered for sale on the academic assistance website Course Hero. These materials, which consisted primarily of course handouts and lecture slides, had been distributed to students enrolled in chemistry courses or posted to the Reed Chemistry webpage for download. Course Hero, a clearinghouse of study documents, made these resources available to students who pay for access to the website.

Since the course materials were publicly available on Reed’s Chemistry webpage, unknown individuals were able to repost them for sale on Course Hero without the consent of the professors who created the materials in the first place. However, most of the material found on Course Hero was outdated, making the material’s value to Reed students questionable. “I did find some of my Chemistry 391 materials there, lifted from the Fall 2007 edition of the course,” says Arthur Glasfeld, professor of biochemistry. He expressed doubt that anyone but a past Reed student could have uploaded the course information.

“I can&#8217;t believe that the 2007 edition of the course is up there simply as a coincidence, or that a current Reed student would prioritize that year&#8217;s material over more recent editions that have been freely available on campus,” Glasfield says.

Glasfeld was not the only one to find course material uploaded to the website without consent. Margaret Geselbracht, professor of inorganic chemistry, found some of her course material taken from an old website hosted on the Reed server.

“I too discovered in the first week of September that some old course materials of mine were on Course Hero due to the fact that I did not remove them from an old website. My response to that discovery was to request that CUS remove my old course websites from the Reed server,” Geselbracht explains.

As of the writing of this article, all of the outdated course material has been removed from school servers to avoid further reposting of course material to Course Hero. It remains unclear what will be done about the materials that have already been uploaded to the website. It is clear, however, that Couse Hero stands to gain from any course material that can be taken from Reed professors.
