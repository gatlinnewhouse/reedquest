_Blue Heron to Take Issue to Phys Plant, Community_

Student Senate voted Tuesday, Nov. 2 to support the addition of gender-neutral bathrooms on campus. Emily Due, Andrew Barney, and James Shelstad, members of the Blue Heron Infoshop, brought the issue to Senate as part of their initiative to designate gender-neutral bathrooms in all buildings on campus in order to protect those members of the community that uncomfortable or unsafe using male/female restrooms.

“There are people who use those buildings every day that have to go to buildings where they feel safe,” Barney said.

The group plans to bring the issue up with Towny Angell, director of facilities operations, as well as other administrators. Currently there are gender-neutral bathrooms in the sports center, student center, and health and counseling center, said Student Senator Zach Levin.

Student Senator Sarah Carlisle suggested that the group hold a Reed union, a panel forum open to the entire college community. The last involved sustainability and took place a couple of years ago, said Austin Campbell, vice president of the student body.

“I want to make sure that the community is in on the conversation, including faculty and staff,” Campbell said.

President Celia Hassan urged the group to begin a community discussion and to put together a poll or referendum for the student body. A non-binding referendum would be placed on the upcoming election ballot, and would require that the group acquire signatures from 20 percent of the student body, Hassan said.

“In principle I very much support this,” said Mike Brody, dean of student services.

Due, Shalstad, and Barney emphasized that the Grey Campus Center, Educational Technology Center and Vollum College Center were their top priorities.

“Our current proposal would leave one gender-segregated bathroom in each building,” Due said.

Student Senator Zach Levin voiced concern that the gender-neutral bathrooms may alienate visitors to the college.

“I think that it’s important that they feel comfortable when they’re here, and I don’t think [gender-neutral bathrooms are] non-trivial for the outside community,” he said.
