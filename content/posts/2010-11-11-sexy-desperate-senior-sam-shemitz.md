**Age:** 22 and ticking

**Hometown:** Santa Cruz, CA

**Major:** Linguistics

**Looking for [sexual preference]:** Women

**Looking for [relationship/casual encounter/etc.]:** Dates, testing the waters of a relationship.

**Your Halloween costume. What inspired it?** I dressed as a Chippendale stripper to challenge my femininity, because it’s much easier to act slinky than musclebound.

**What makes you SDS of the Week?** Well, how many other people were sexy enough to make money at Harvest Ball?

**What’s your daily hair routine?** After each shower, I’ve been whipping my hair around since before Willow Smith was born. That stuff gotta get dry!

**Musical artist of choice for those romantic moments?** Some nice Belle & Sebastian, or else a blockbuster soundtrack

**Favorite feature in a girl/guy?** Computer skills and a passion for adventure

**Pet peeve(s)?** Cyclists on sidewalks or without helmets; renaming 39th to Cesar Chavez Boulevard; the Greengrocer’s Apostrophe

**Is the ex-Gentle Giant a gentle lover, or into edgier stuff?** There’s nothing wrong with some private LARPing, but if you want to get hurt you will have to teach me how.
