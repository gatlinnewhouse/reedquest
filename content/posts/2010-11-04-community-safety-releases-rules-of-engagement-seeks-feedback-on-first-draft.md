It seems two documents, the Alcohol and Drug Policy and its implementation plan, are not enough to guide the treatment of drugs at Reed.

A draft of Rules of Engagement for community safety officers dealing with drug and alcohol violations have been released by Gary Granger, director of community safety, in order to draw comments from the community.

“The AOD implementation plan does not have specific guidelines for how individual community safety officers do work in the field,” Granger said. “The departmental directive guide is designed to allow us to train the officer on how to act in the field so that all officers approach it in the same way.”

The document has been presented as a draft in order to create discussion and debate, said Mike Brody, dean of student services.

Many instances of reported or observed behavior justify the engagement of individuals by community safety officers, according to the Rules. These include disruptive behavior, intoxication, attempts to conceal alcohol, and personal knowledge that an individual is under 21. Officers shall also verify the age of those that distribute alcohol from a container that “a reasonable officer would conclude contains more than an individual could safely consume in a single sitting.”

Other rules include possession of more alcohol than one could safely consume in a single seating, a first-hand report that an individual is under 21, and whenever an officer “establishes a reasonable concern that an individual’s behavior involving alcohol presents a safety risk, is disruptive, or otherwise violates Reed policy or the law.”

“We want students to understand we’re paying attention,” Brody said. “No one’s getting bonuses for writing up the most students.”

The document also states that community safety officers will assume that individuals with alcohol are complying with the honor principle and policy unless they have a reasonable concern that the individual is violating policy, the law, or that alcohol use has created an unsafe situation.

Community safety officers will confiscate all illegal drugs, as well as alcohol in the possession of minors, according to the implementation plan. All alcohol confiscated from minors will be destroyed, Granger said. An appeals process may be developed in the future for those that feel their alcohol was wrongly confiscated.

Reports of alcohol and drug violations are forwarded to the student services office, which maintains a record of each individual’s violation, according to the implementation plan. Letters from Dean of Student Services Mike Brody may be issued to violators describing the consequences of the violation.

This departmental directive does not need to be approved by President Colin Diver, Granger said.

The document has been released to the public in order to receive feedback before it is officially put in place.

The directives (included on page 6) may be accessed online by members of the community via Granger’s Community Safety Blog, and comments should be directed to Granger at [&#x67;&#x72;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x65;&#x72;&#x67;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1] or 503-777-7379.
