Winter in Portland can make the entire campus feel like a monochromatic haze. But Jay Ewing, who is a Physics Department associate, uses a D.I.Y. full-spectrum lighting fixture to combat the malaise of the darker months. All intro physics students pass through Ewing&#8217;s lab, and many leave with a greater and more practical understanding of the physical world.

As a staff member at Reed, one of Ewing&#8217;s main roles is to supervise the TAs of Physics 101 and 102. He describes part of his job as fostering a good employer-employee relationship with students. “I feel like what I try to impart to TAs is to teach them how to be good employees. It&#8217;s something most people don&#8217;t learn until their first real job.&#8221; Ewing runs a tight ship and is very impressed with the quality of work the TAs do. &#8220;They definitely have a sense of ownership of how 100 is run. There are TAs that have been with the lab for three years.&#8221;

After graduating Reed and receiving a masters in physics from Harvard, Ewing taught machining courses at Mt. Hood Community College and an electronics summer course at Harvard. He worked for E Ink, the company that invented the type of electronic paper used in e-readers, when they were a small start-up. Now that digital readers have become ubiquitous, Ewing looks back fondly at his old job. “It&#8217;s fun to see a product out there that you helped work on,&#8221; he says. His spirit of invention still lives on today. Ewing creates and builds LED flashlights with customized spectra that he sells to employees of Physical Plant.

In past years, Physics 102 only had one lab assignment on electronics. Ewing talks about why he advocated for electronics to have a more prominent role in Physics 102: &#8220;In mechanics, 30 percent error is really not that bad, but the nice thing about electronics is that it works really well in lab. It&#8217;s really accessible for first year students.&#8221; His love of machining lead Ewing to become good friends with Reed&#8217;s machinist Greg Eibel. Ewing wrote his thesis under Professor Mary James and he studied microwave photonic crystals. These structures manipulate the motion of photons. When he needed to build microwave horns to direct the microwaves, he built them with Greg. Upon returning to Reed, Ewing reunited with his friend: &#8220;He&#8217;s been a great mentor. It&#8217;s hard to image Reed without him.&#8221; Students who visit his office can still see the copper horns overlooking his desk.

Ewing lives on a farm outside Portland. He has two cats named Bandit and Smokey, &#8220;one real fat and the other real skinny.&#8221; In his spare time, he runs the website for Master Gardeners, a volunteer program associated with land-grant universities that provides gardening and horticultural resources for the public. Ewing is an avid gardener and his favorite vegetables to grow are hot weather crops like hot peppers and okra. Oregon has a difficult climate for this and Ewing says, “It&#8217;s always a challenge.&#8221; However, the reward of fried okra makes him up for the challenge.

When Ewing wanted to fish in Costa Rica for a year, he shipped his boat from Boston to the Gulf. For the American fisherman, the Atlantic bluefin tuna is a good catch. The fish is highly prized in Japan, which makes it hard to find in American markets. After catching a 500-pound marlin, Ewing finally caught his meal. He reminisced about the beauty of the catch: &#8220;It was good eating, can&#8217;t even eat them in the U.S.&#8221;

Ewing believes that his diverse life experience can help students approach learning from a different perspective. &#8220;Everyone has their role to play and it&#8217;s all about what you can bring to the table.&#8221; Theoretical knowledge should be in balance with practical knowledge. A poster of the internet meme called the Done Manifesto hangs on his wall. He points to his favorite line: &#8220;People without dirty hands are wrong.&#8221;
