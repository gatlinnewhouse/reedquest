_Oregon Experience: Reed_, the latest episode in Oregon Public Broadcasting’s historical series, proceeds from the turn of the century, when Reed was just a glimmer in Amanda and Simeon Reed’s eyes, through two world wars, twelve amendments to the Constitution, and recurring internal disputes, to Paul Bragdon’s presidency in the seventies and eighties. The documentary, which can be viewed online at www.opb.org, focuses on controversies whose outcomes define Reed as we know it today. Like other public broadcasting documentaries, this one suffers from an overabundance of narration over stills of historical photographs, though not to the detriment of the documentary’s vision. President William Trufant Foster’s hope that “Reed College will continue to stand staunchly, and if necessary stand alone, for whatever Reed College considered right,” is enough to inspire all but the most apathetic Reedie.

Even before Reed was established, intellectuals debated its goals and practices. Amanda Reed, whose husband, Simeon Reed, was a wealthy transportation tycoon in Portland, requested in her will that the college be dedicated to “literature, science, and the arts” in one section and to “practical knowledge” and the “manual training” of its students in others. After a lengthy legal battle, the ideals that would, in the words of President Diver, define Reed as “an intellectual hothouse” emerged victorious.

Foster, the first president of Reed, was described in a letter to a Portland newspaper as one of many “socialist sowers of class hatred and the secret champions of Germany,” after he expressed pacifist opinions during World War One. Though Foster later helped establish the precursor to the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, allowed barracks to be built on campus, and organized a battlefield medicine training program at Reed for women, Reed would still be remembered by the local community as a “hotbed of socialism.”

The second president of Reed, Richard F. Scholz, took over after Foster resigned in 1919. Scholz introduced core curriculum requirements, an emphasis on humanities, and conference-style learning. He also introduced enough new, ideologically-aligned faculty members to create a schism amongst the faculty. The apparent discrepancies between Foster’s idealist pursuit of “the Dream” and Scholz’s more structured approach were not reconciled until Reed’s third president, Norman Coleman, took office. Coleman  blended the two philosophies into a synergy that came to be called “a life of the mind.”

_Oregon Experience: Reed_ then follows Reed through World War Two, the highly contested firing of Professor Stanley Moore by President Duncan Ballantine during the McCarthy era, the age of art history professor Lloyd Reynolds, the Civil Rights Movement, and multiple financial difficulties. The documentary gives the evolution of Reed culture, like Renn Fayre and the Honor Principle, far less attention.  Reed’s history after Bragdon put the college on stable financial ground is also largely ignored. Nevertheless, _Oregon Experience: Reed_ offers an insightful synopsis of the transformation of the college over the past century.
