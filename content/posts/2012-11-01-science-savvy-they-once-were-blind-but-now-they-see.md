_**By Anna Henkin **_

Nearly 10% of United States citizens over the age of 65 are legally blind. They suffer from a disease called age-related macular degeneration. This debilitating disease is caused when the light sensing cells (photoreceptors) in the center of the retina die. At first only mild vision loss occurs, eventually replaced by total blindness.

When I was six years old, my grandfather would expertly drive me to and from school, but now he can’t even steer himself around chairs in a dimly lit restaurant. He has age-related macular degeneration. Currently no treatments can restore his vision, but the results of a recent study indicate that this dismal prognosis may change.

A group of scientists, led by Rachael Pearson at the University College London, injected stem cells primed to become rod photoreceptors into the retinas of blind mice, restoring their low-light vision. Rod photoreceptors are light sensing cells that endow us with low-light vision. Although the idea of using stem cells to replace and regrow damaged tissues is not new, the results of this recent study raise exciting possibilities for treating blindness, like that caused by macular degeneration.

The researchers first engineered a mutant mouse that lacked functional rod photoreceptors. These mice can see under bright light (comparable to daylight) but are blind under low light (comparable to a cloudy night or a lecture hall when the lights are off). These mutant mice that lack rod photoreceptors are essentially night blind. To test if their night vision could be restored, Pearson and her colleagues injected stem cells that were primed to become rod photoreceptors into the eyes of the mutant mice.

With a series of careful experiments, the authors first showed that the transplanted rod precursor cells formed appropriate connections with neighboring cells and triggered activity in the visual cortex, a region of the brain that receives information from the eye. Then the researchers tested for visual behaviors, using a swimming maze test. Normal (wild-type), mutant, and treated mice were taught to swim through a T-maze toward a striped pattern under bright-light conditions.

The researchers next turned the lights off and illuminated the maze with dim light. As expected, the wild-type mice easily picked out the striped side and quickly exited the maze. The untreated mutant mice, which are night-blind, couldn’t differentiate between the exit and the dead end. Mutant mice that had received stem cell injections navigated the maze under low light conditions. Miraculously, their “night vision” was restored. Movies of these maze-navigation experiments can be found [online][1].

Despite the promise of this study, many obstacles remain before stem cell injection can be implemented in humans. The biggest problem is the source of the required cells. To restore sight in a single eye of a blind mouse, the researchers had to harvest rod precursor cells from several retinas of newborn mice. Many newborn mice had to be sacrificed. One way to overcome the ethical issues surrounding such procedures in humans would be to grow retinal stem cells and/or whole retinas in dishes in the laboratory. In fact, an earlier Science Savvy, “Eye’ll be Back”, discussed the work of a Japanese group performing such procedures. Although a cure won’t arrive in time for my grandfather, I’m hoping that my generation will witness the power of stem cells for vision restoration in humans.
