I come in at 12:05, the taste of Reds still hanging at the back of my throat, and she’s there, lying on the table waiting for me. She’s pale, almost white, and the computer modern font meanders over her body. She’s taunting me – her pages are split at the staple, spread wide open to Chapter 5: Empirical Results. This has happened before, too many times. She just stares at me, waiting. The Big T.

“Look,” I say, putting down my bag “we’ve talked about this.”

But she doesn’t seem to hear. She just stares back at me, doesn’t say a word.

“I have a job now, I’m working.”

Nothing.

“I can’t spend all my time with you like I used to. I need to have a life.”

Still, there’s no bargaining with her. She knows all too well that my protests are in vain. We’re both aware I can’t stay away. After all: I have a deadline. In three weeks, she’s got to be done.

So I do the only thing I can do, I pull out the scotch and pour myself a glass.

“Alright,” I mutter under my breath, “let’s do this.”

When I wake up the next morning, the last thing I remember from that night is the taste of smoke from the whiskey and the pattering of keys on my laptop. She’s sprawled out on my bed, almost ripped apart from last night. Two pizza boxes lie on the floor. There are clothes everywhere. My boxers are hanging from the bookshelf. I take stock.

“We can’t do this anymore,” I say.

She doesn’t say a thing. She just stares at me again, waiting.
