What&#8217;s up, readers? Thanks for electing us to be your Quest editors again. We&#8217;ll bring you quality news reporting, interesting features, and opinion from relevant members of the community. Our mission is to bring you the best paper we can this coming semester—but we&#8217;ll need your help.

We know we&#8217;ve not been perfect last semester. We labelled some opinion articles as news, we messed up some quotes, and we missed some facts. No one&#8217;s perfect—we&#8217;re sure it&#8217;ll happen again at least once this semester. However, we&#8217;ll strive to improve everything we can, and feedback from the community is crucial.

If you think something could improve, tell us. Think an article was unfair? Miss a classic feature? (Did someone say Lutz Report?) We have open meetings every week, tentatively scheduled next semester for Wednesday nights at nine. You can also email us at [_&#x71;&#x75;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;_][1] with any comments and recommendations.

If you have an opinion to share, send it to us. Especially if you occupy a particular position of authority on campus, we&#8217;d love to publish your moderately toned and well-reasoned perspectives.

And finally, if you really want to make a contribution, become a reporter for us. We&#8217;re always looking for new talent, and it&#8217;s never been easier to get involved. Just come to a weekly meeting, with or without a story idea, and we&#8217;ll give you something to write about for the next issue.

We promise to bring you quality news reporting, to give voice to relevant opinions, and to refrain from channelling our sexual frustrations into mediocre comedy (hey, student body, I think The Pamphlette could use your help too—maybe if someone finally slept with one of them, they&#8217;d stop fantasizing about being secretly desired by Quest editors). So keep on reading, keep on criticizing, and start talking to us.
