Upon hearing the announcement that the performing arts building was a go, President Colin Diver was so elated that “he was practically levitating,” said a member present at the meeting. 

Last Saturday, the Reed College board of trustees gave final approval for the construction of a new performing arts building. Part of a list of twelve goals the college hopes to achieve as a part of its Centennial campaign, the new building would serve as a center to house the dance, theater, and music departments. Plans for this new state-of-the-art facility include multiple theaters, studios, practice rooms, faculty offices, dressing rooms, a scene studio, a costume studio, and a “winter garden” atrium. Building will be conducted in two parts – split into two phases – with the projected completion date for phase one to be the summer of 2013. Phase two, a proscenium theater seating 450, will begin once sufficient funds to finance it have been secured. Phase one will begin immediately, in August 2011.

As of right now, $28 million have been allocated to the building of phase one. This figure is less than the initially requested $35 million, but will still provide Reed with the beginnings of the long-asked for integrated arts center. The building will stand southwest of Kaul Auditorium, in the west parking lot. The tennis courts will be relocated to north campus, and offices and rooms from Prexy and Eliot will be relocated to the new building. 

Though initially met with resistance by those who felt funds would be better utilized for other needs the college has, feedback has generally been positive.

“I’m very excited to be connected with the rest of the campus,” commented Denise VanLeuven, Director of Musical Instruction. “Prexy is out on the fringe. Some students don’t even know it’s here. They could take years just to find it!”

Reed has a relatively active performing arts scene for a liberal arts school, says VanLeuven, and she looks forward to seeing an even greater increase in participation with the construction of new facilities. “Though I don’t know about expanding the actual department, I think participation will rise. Ten percent of students participate already [in Reed’s music program], and that’s a high percentage for a small liberal arts college. This will hopefully make performing arts more visible.” VanLeuven also shared her excitement over the prospect of soundproof rooms.

“We’ve been hoping for this for years,” enthused Kathleen Worely, a professor in the theater department. Echoing VanLeuven’s optimism that performing arts will become an even larger presence on campus. “We’re very excited. We’re looking forward to a really exciting place and hope this will draw people to the dramatic process of creating stuff.”

The main goal of the building is to integrate the different departments on campus that fall under the umbrella of performing arts. Faculty and students alike are eager to see what new and fantastic projects will result from this amalgamation. 

“We’re looking forward to more collaboration with other departments. As of right now, we’re very spread out,” said VanLeuven.

“Reed is a great place for this to happen because there’s such a strong connection between the liberal arts and the fine arts, but we haven’t been able to fully explore it for so long,” said Worely. “Now we’ll get to find out what it’s like to really make connections. We’re all for it!”
