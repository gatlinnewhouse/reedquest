The restoration process that transformed the Reed Canyon from a mess of invasive plants and disconnected waterways into the present ecologically stable and pleasantly walkable space will continue this semester with a host of new endeavors by the Canyon Crew. Under Canyon Specialist Zac Perry’s direction, the crew plans to install a second fish ladder camera, build a new trail that connects the Farm House to the existing system, and maintain the trails and ecological balance they have already established.

The new camera will be planted in the creek near the Farm House and will join its predecessor in the mission of determining the species and numbers of salmonids (salmon-like fish) that travel up Crystal Springs Creek into Reed Lake. According to a 2009 environmental economics study conducted by Reed students, the Canyon features “the only naturally occurring lake remaining in the inner city of Portland” and, as part of the Crystal Creek watershed, “some of the purest water in Portland.” Threatened Coho salmon, steelhead, and many other fish species rely on the waterway, though the extent of this reliance is not know. Zac Perry confirmed that the new camera, at “the front door of the creek,” will aid in this investigation.

The blazing of the new trail leading to the Farm House will be accompanied by constant upkeep and renewal of the existing Canyon trails. Some parts of the trails have been only marginally upheld since they were built over ten years ago, when Perry first arrived at Reed, and are thus on the verge of collapse. He has plans to “modernize” the system. The failing sections will be reinforced and mulched in the same way that all the Crew’s tasks are achieved: by hand.

With regard to the constant succession of tasks that the Canyon supplies, Perry sagely remarks that “its one of those jobs you can’t turn your back on. It doesn’t take much more than a bird pooping out blackberry seeds to restart the invasive plant cycle.” Anyone who ripped up blackberry vines at this year’s Canyon Day will know that fighting invasive plant species like Himalayan blackberry and English ivy is another primary concern of the Crew. Perry described Canyon Crew’s regular routine as “weeding and planting interchangeably.” The Canyon Crew’s planting is entirely vegetative, which means that new native species are planted from trimmings of the mature plants that were already in the Canyon when the restoration began. Nowhere are any pesticides used.

While there are indeed large projects afoot, the process of Canyon restoration remains fundamentally the same. The Canyon was full of litter when Perry arrived and still, he says “there are always beer cans and always cigarette butts.” Canyon Day, occuring on March 31<sup>st</sup> from 9 A.M. To 3 P.M., will enlist the Student Body’s help to maintain Canyon health. “The Canyon’s beauty,” Perry concluded, “is a reflection of the work students have put into it. Without this work it wouldn’t be a fun place to walk and hang out… Be nice to the Canyon Crew.” And, as an addendum, he added that employment is available for this summer and for next year.
