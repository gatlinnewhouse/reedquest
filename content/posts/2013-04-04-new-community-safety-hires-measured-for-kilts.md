Community Safety recently hired a number of new part time and on-call CSOs. Director of Community Safety Gary Granger’s standard of excellence? “Whether or not they’ll wear a kilt to Renn Fayre.” On-call CSOs are on staff in order to cover the occasional vacant shift.

Granger says that what he looks for in new hires is not necessarily experience, but attitude. Tall Pawl, Granger points out, had no experience coming into the job. Jess Dimicelli, on the other hand, worked as a police officer for a correctional facility. “Some things [about Reed] really aren’t going to work for some people,” Granger says, citing the naked tree and student propensity to ask “why” when it comes to AODs as instances that could make a prospective CSO uncomfortable. Granger says that he’s looking for people who are not only going to tolerate these situations, but enjoy them – someone who enjoys a good argument. “We don’t enforce the law here, we engage students,” Granger says.

New hires with a background in security often have to unlearn what they’ve learned at other jobs. Granger, who worked in a large retail store prior to his time at Reed says that security there and security here are wildly different jobs. Retail includes a lot of sneaking around, suspicion, and trying to catch people stealing – a skillset not needed on the Reed campus.

New hires are paired with a trained CSO officer for six weeks to trail them and learn how they deal with various situations they could encounter on campus. According to Granger, the first challenge for new officers is learning the geography and terminology of the school. “GCC” and “fire alarm panel” are mystery locations for the first few days. The second challenge is learning how to interact with students according to Community Safety standards. Granger points out that it’s strange for people who have worked in law enforcement to approach students holding a bong, and start by saying, “Hi! I’m Gary.”

In addition to the new officers, Community Safety hired a new assistant director. Asked what the job of the assistant director is, Granger replies “we’re working it out.”

A few of the new Community Safety Officers have been fitted for kilts.
