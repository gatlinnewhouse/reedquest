In some of my recent encounters with upperclassmen, I’ve realized we all could learn a little about freshman-upperclassmen etiquette.

I’ll try not to be too harsh in my advice since I understand how embarrassing it would be to let a freshman make you cry.

Don’t call us weird names. We don’t appreciate being called things like “freshling” or “baby Reedie.”  We served our time as propsies and now we’re just plain old Reedies.

Don’t bemoan the fall of Olde Reed.  We get it that there’s a new Hum curriculum, so we’re the first class not read the Iliad.  Except that we’re not because—and I’ll be honest with you here—Reed hasn’t always had the same Hum curriculum.  And if you think CSOs writing kids up in Sallyport is the end of the world, maybe you should think about why you so desperately want to prop yourself up against a Gothic brick building in your Docs drinking illicit Four Lokos.  Or at least think about why you consider this the essence of Reed.

Remember you were once in our shoes.  Granted, they were slightly less hipster shoes (unless you too pulled off the granny boots as a mere frosh), but you also probably didn’t like it when upperclassmen condescended to you.  Chances are, since we all got into Reed, we’re probably just as quirky and lovable as you are.

On a last note, we really do appreciate all the beer fairies of O-week and otherwise generous upperclassmen.

Don’t think this a generalization of either you or us.  We’re not a perfect class—if you see a freshman scrounging or drinking out of a can in front of Commons, slap his or her hand and remind everyone what mugs are for.

Don’t be jerks,
