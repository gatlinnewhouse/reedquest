Last Thursday evening, as light darkened beyond the windows of Eliot Chapel, Carl Phillips, described in the New Yorker as, “a candidate for the most interesting contemporary English sentences,” presented an audience with a selection of his compelling poems. Over the past twenty-one years, Phillips has authored twelve books of poetry, including most recently _Silverchest_ and _Double Shadow._ His works have garnered him copious awards, including fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Library of Congress, and the Academy of American Poets, to which he was also appointed Chancellor in 2006.

Despite his renown as a poet, Phillips is not content with riding his past successes. “I don’t quite think,” joked Creative Writing Professor Samiya Bashir, “Carl just sits in his garden and collects awards.” On top of writing poetry, Phillips also translates Classical works by the likes of Sophocles, sits as a judge for the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, and teaches at Washington University in St. Louis.

Drawing from his most recent collection, _Silverchest,_ the poet began his reading with “Just the Wind for a Sound, Softly”, before making his way through several more of his chilling, complex works. As the evening progressed, the audience got a taste of a Phillip’s self-deprecating charm. “I won’t say a lot between poems. I’ll try to, but generally when I do it comes out stupid.”

Placed in conjunction with his poems, the combination of Phillip’s humorous anecdotes and serious, sparse lines painted a portrait of a complex man. In poems such as “Bluegrass”, inspired by one of his father’s dreams involving two fighting dogs, Phillips demonstrated his ability to turn a simple image into something both strange and beautiful. In the barren imagery and bleak rhetoric of “Surrounded as We Are, Unlit, Unshadowed”, the audience discovered a man plagued by questions concerning love and fear. Phillips quickly dulled the poem’s serious edge with an answer to a question posed at the end of “Unlit, Unshadowed”, which asks, “’why do we love, at all?’ I was thinking about that question as I was writing the poem…because it’s fun is why.”

Offering a glimpse into his process, Phillips offered up a few explanations for some of the titles of his poems. While a few titles borrowed lines from the works of Henry David Thoreau and Hart Crane, others drew from more contemporary sources, such as the lyrics of indie rock band Gossip.

After his last poem of the evening, “Silverchest”, Phillips took the opportunity to step out from behind the podium and field some questions regarding his work. When asked about his writing process and whether or not he has a fixed routine, Phillips touched upon the limits of his schedule, as well as how writing poetry fits into his relatively average lifestyle. “I walk my dog a lot,” explained Phillips, “and I think during that time I chew on different phrases.”

Phillips responded to a question regarding a controversial anthology in which a few of his poems were included. Despite minor concerns that the selected poems weren’t representative of his work as a whole, he touched upon the overall positive nature of his inclusion in the book.“You should be grateful to be included in an anthology because it’s a way for someone to discover your poems.”

Humble through and through, Phillips continued to thoughtfully answer questions before wrapping up his evening in Eliot Hall Chapel and signing books for both old and new admirers of his poetry.
