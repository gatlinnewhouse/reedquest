On Tuesday, President Colin Diver sent an open letter to the Reed community broadly outlining steps the college will take toward reforming its institutional approach to sexual assault. In the past semester, Reed’s sexual assault policy has been criticized for insufficiently addressing the needs of victims and inadequacy in its adjudication process.

The letter, distributed in the form of a campus-wide e-mail, comes in response to mounting pressure from various members of the Reed community advocating for reform of the college’s sexual assault policies. Specifically, the letter cites two petitions created by faculty and students calling for reform.

“I take with utmost seriousness the petitioners’ calls for reform and increased resources for the prevention and of sexual assault cases,” said Diver in his letter. Additionally, his letter describes a “thorough policy review” of the college’s compliance with Title IX, FERPA, and the Clery Act; federal laws that concern academic-institutional response to crime and sexual assault.

The first petition began circulating on April 18 and was created Students for Sexual Assault Support Services, an informal student advocacy group. Alongside the petition, SSASS organized last Thursday’s “Take Back the Night” vigil, as well as signage advocating sexual assault awareness across campus. According to SSASS, the petition called for “specific and immediate changes to the current sexual assault policy and practices.”

“This petition was in circulation for 100 hours and gained 847 signatures of support, 58% of the student body,” SSASS stated in a press release to the Quest last week. “We see the overwhelming success of this petition as a clear expression of the gravity of this issue and our collective commitment…to improve the current procedures used by the college to prevent and respond to sexual assault.”

The faculty petition was inspired by the petition circulated by SSASS and was submitted to the president late last week. Jackie Dirks, professor of history, and Alex Montgomery-Amo, professor of political science, were allegedly responsible for circulating the petition among faculty members.

“We feel that these policies and procedures harm the victims of sexual assault they are designed to help,” stated the faculty petition. “We are also concerned about a lack of due process and confidentiality for those students who are accused of assault.” Additionally, the petition stated that “[the undersigned] support the students in their calls for reform.”

While Diver’s letter does not specifically respond to any of these calls, it anticipates “a constructive conversation about the [recommended] changes as well as those to be recommended in the forthcoming report of the Ad-Hoc Committee on Sexual Assault.” The committee, comprised of ten faculty members, staff and student members, sent out a community-wide e-mail stating that it would submit its recommendations sometime this week.

No timetable was given for any policy reform, but is expected that if Diver chooses to take action, he will do so after receiving the committee’s recommendations and discussing the issue at Wednesday’s town hall meeting. However, some students remain skeptical that anything will come from these calls for reform.

“Changing the sexual assault policy was never on Colin’s agenda when he was appointed as president,” said a member of the sexual assault task force and sexual assault survivor who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

“[Wednesday’s] town hall meeting is no exception. It gives him a chance to survey the opinions and concerns the Reed community has and do as much damage control as he can, but I doubt there will be any legal restructuring to our sexual assault policy.”

**Update:** On Wednesday, the Ad-Hoc Committee on Sexual Assault released their recommendations to the Reed community, which can be read [here][1]. President Diver also stated on Wednesday that it had been found that Reed&#8217;s judicial process was out of compliance with Title IX, FERPA, and the Clery Act; and that effective immediately, the judicial process will comply with federal law. Lastly, we have also been informed that &#8220;Take Back the Night&#8221; was organized by Reed&#8217;s Feminist Student Union, _not_ SSASS.
