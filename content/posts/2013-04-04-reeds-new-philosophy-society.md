On March 28, approximately 15 students—along with Philosophy Professor Troy Cross—gathered for the first meeting of Reed’s Philosophy Society. The intimate confines of Winch provided the perfect setting for the passionate intellectual conversation that lasted far longer than the presentation itself, and the first gathering of this new society took on the feeling of a long-standing Reed tradition. Sanjeev Verma presented on “Agency: Killing and Letting Die,” a defense of British philosopher Philippa Foot’s distinction between the two, in light of later criticisms put forth by American philosopher Jeff McMahan. Verma plans on giving the presentation at Pacific University’s Undergraduate Philosophy Conference taking place on April 19 and 20. He saw this as an opportunity to practice delivering the presentation and to get suggestions for improvement during the question and answer session.

The format of a 15-20 minute talk followed by a much longer question and answer session appeared to work well, as students asked for elaborations, argued points, and presented new scenarios in which to apply Foot’s model for nearly an hour following the presentation. Verma was quick on his feet, answering to a wide variety of questions and dilemmas, diligently explaining some of the more difficult points and constantly taking into account how he might be able to use the suggestions to strengthen his argument. Elise Woodard ’15, who organized the meeting, stated that the setting of the set-up of the Philosophy Society provides a good opportunity for making presentations like this in a more informal setting.

Woodard, who transferred to Reed from SUNY-Stonybrook at the beginning of the year, is trying to create a similar forum to one that was present there. “[Stonybrook] has a continental philosophy program,” she explained, “which allowed for discussion as diverse as feminism, political philosophy, and transhumanism to be brought up at Philosophy Society meetings there.” With the specialization of Reed’s philosophy program in analytic philosophy, the group might “provide an opportunity to have conversations that take place in other philosophy programs” covering a diverse range of topics in philosophy. The time and structure of future meetings has yet to be determined, but after the success of the first presentation a similar format might be pursued in the future.

The next meeting will take place on Wednesday, April 10 at 7:30 p.m. in Winch, with Woodard presenting on the topic of food ethics.
