At one and a half, a child has a clear notion of what is stereotypically gender normal. At three years old, a child knows its gender. At four, a child’s toy preference is based off gender symbolism: pink for girls and blue for boys. Surprisingly, sex and gender are more prominent in the early stages of a child’s life than previously assumed. On Thursday, in Vollum Lecture Hall, Anne Fausto-Sterling, the Biology and Gender Studies Professor at Brown University, led Reed’s very first gender and sexuality symposium on this topic.

Fausto-Sterling has spent eight years studying this developmental aspect of gender and sexuality studies, and her work is just now starting to make a large impact on the field. Unlike most gender and sexuality studies conducted before her, Fausto-Sterling views sex and gender as a process she calls the principles of development as opposed to viewing them as a mere trait of personality. Instead of reducing sex and gender to a trait, Fausto-Sterling focuses on sex and gender in the neurological development of infants from zero to thirty six months, the primary age of development. While some may think the ultimate goal of this research is to decode gender, in a way that would allow parents to manipulate their children into the gender they want, Fausto-Sterling disagrees, saying that her research is aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of gender and sexuality.

Fausto-Sterling started by discussing some of the neonatal traits that differentiate sexes at birth, including head circumference, weight, and health. Males infants tend to have a bigger head circumference and weigh more than female infants, but female infants tend to be healthier. While these are biological aspects that set the sexes apart immediately at birth, factors like infant irritability, the amount of sleep parents get, infant alertness, and the bonding between an infant and its parent are influential on a child’s gender and sexuality development.

Anne Fausto-Sterling spent much of the first part of her lecture explaining her ideas with statistics and abstract concepts, but she began to clarify herself when she explained the concept that gender is a pre-symbolic code, meaning gender is not a pre- established symbol in the child’s mind, and begins developing in the womb and is highly influenced by exposure post-birth. The most common example of gender as a pre- symbolic code is the sex differentiation in toy preference. A parent of a female infant is more likely to expose their child to stereotypical girl things, such as the color pink, tiaras, cooking sets, etc. The same is expected of a parent of a male infant, although with stereotypical boy things, such as the color blue, sports, and construction tools. In addition, the tone of excitement from a parent seeing their child drawn to a certain object reinforces the child’s gender preference.

Much of this exposure comes from a parent’s verbal encouragement. Fausto- Sterling showed two videos, one of a mother playing with her son and another of a mother playing with her daughter. The mother kept calling her son “tough” and “strong” and asked “are you going to play football like Daddy?” The mother with her daughter, however, asked things like “how will you get it?” when her daughter dropped a toy.

The pre-symbolic gender formation occurs from zero to eighteen months and then transitions to the symbolic gender formation, which occurs from eighteen to thirty months. When the symbolic gender forms, children begin to get the ideas of objects being gendered. Fausto-Sterling spoke of an experiment performed on a toddler where the proctor held up a picture of an object and the child would say whether it was a boy object or a girl object. By one and a half years old, if a child sees a man putting on makeup or a woman doing construction work, the child will become confused and show a disconcerting look on their face.

Fausto-Sterling summed up the symposium by highlighting that infants experience gender via minutiae of everyday care, then develop gender recognition skills, and then gender performance skills and preferences are developed during the second year.

Overall, Fausto-Sterling’s symposium was more biology-and neurology-focused than most students expected. Despite Fausto-Sterling being a Biology professor, students who attended were hoping for her to teach a more psychological approach to the way in which gender and sexuality develops in children as opposed to neurological development. Caitlin O’Shea ‘17, said “I thought it was an interesting subject, one that raised a lot of different questions for me. However, I think it would have been more interesting if she had discussed the politics surrounding the issue as well as the science.”

Timmy Brandow ‘15, said the following: “I found it a little underwhelming. I was personally expecting something groundbreaking that would change how I perceived gender and sex development; I didn&#8217;t get that. It seemed like much of her presentation was just setting up red herring statistics of sorts that she didn&#8217;t even particularly provide any weight in her conclusions and her sense of the implications of her research.”

Despite Fausto-Sterling’s symposium being somewhat of a let down to students, many students who attended look forward to Reed having more sexuality and gender symposiums in the future.
