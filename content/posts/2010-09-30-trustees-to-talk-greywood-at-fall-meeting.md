The Reed Board of Trustees will convene for their first meeting of the 2010-11 fiscal year on Friday, October 1. The trustees will spend Friday afternoon in committee meetings, followed by dinner with Reed administrators and the student body president and vice president. On Saturday they will come together for a series of formal plenary sessions.

Foremost on the agenda for Saturday are the proposed construction plans and budget for the new Greywood building. Once completed, the new building will house the Admissions office, Print Shop, and a number of faculty offices and classrooms.

While faculty expressed concerns about the impact of the project on the timeline for the new performing arts center, to be located on the West Lawn beside Kaul Auditorium, at the faculty meeting on September 20, approval from the trustees will allow construction to begin as soon as Spring 2011. The plans include the construction of a courtyard between the ETC and the new Greywood building similar to the International Plaza, and the closing of Eliot Drive to prevent parking between Woodstock Blvd. and Eliot Circle.

President Colin Diver will also present on the wellbeing of the college and Dean of Student Services Mike Brody will deliver a general update on the current projects being overseen by his office. Issues of investment, academic affairs, and the extension of the fish ladder currently under construction on 28 St. will also merit attention, though primarily in committee.

In response to a specific request from the Board, Brody will also hold a plenary session dedicated to the issue of alcohol and other drugs on campus. Head of Community Safety Gary Granger will also be present to answer questions directly related to CSO protocol.

The Board consists of thirty-two members, twenty-three of whom are Reed graduates. According to the Reed Institute bylaws, President Colin Diver also serves as a member of the Board as “the chief executive officer of the corporation and of the College.” Beside the president of the college, each trustee typically serves for six years. Four trustees serve for four years each and have been selected in such a way that one term expires every year. This mixes up the composition of the Board and allows for the inclusion of new perspectives.

Dr. Michael Mercy, class of 1987, currently serves as the trustee liaison to the student body. The Chairman and Medical Director of Emergency Medicine of Idaho, located in Boise, Dr. Mercy has attended a number of student senate meetings in past years and met with student leaders to facilitate communication and connection between the two groups.

The Board typically holds three meetings per year in October, February, and April. During lunch Saturday a number of the trustees will join other alumni in the annual Reed Alumni Volunteer Weekend for “Schmoozing Is Good for Your Brain,” a networking event sponsored by Career Services in Kaul from 12:00pm-1:30pm.
