**CW: Sexual assault mentions**

The Judicial Board adjudicated a complaint brought against a student alleged to have committed plagiarism on their Junior Qualifying Exam. The Board found that the student had violated the Academic Conduct Policy and Honor Principle by purposefully using prohibited sources to complete their exam and by plagiarizing substantial portions of their exam from outside sources. The Board also found that the student acted less than honorably by being dishonest when confronted by faculty with the accusations. The student had previously been sanctioned for an Academic Conduct Policy violation.

The Board recommended that the respondent be expelled from the college effective immediately, and that information pertaining to the case not be made available to inquiring third-party institutions. The President upheld the Board’s findings and sanctions, with the exception that information from this case can be shared with third-party institutions with the written consent of the respondent. 

The Judicial Board received a complaint filed by a student against several other students alleged to have violated the Honor Principle by spreading rumors about the complainant. The Judicial Board reviewed the complaint and determined mediation might be more appropriate for this case. The Judicial Board requested the complainant attempt mediation and referred them to the Honor Council. In cases where mediation fails or is refused, the Judicial Board will take up the case.  This case was not brought back to the Judicial Board. 

The Judicial Board adjudicated a complaint brought by a Reed College staff member against a student alleged to have violated the Honor Principle by using abusive and sexist speech during a public lecture. The Board found that the student did violate the Honor Principle by using misogynistic language in a hostile and intimidating context.

The Board recommended that the student perform community service, and suggested, but did not require, the student write a public letter of apology to the community. The Board also recommended, but did not require, the student write a statement about their specific grievances with the lecture and share it with the lecture organizers. The President’s Designee upheld the Board’s findings, but changed the Board’s sanctions to require a written public apology to the community, with community service and a statement outlining grievances recommended, but not required.

The Judicial Board adjudicated a complaint brought by a Reed College staff member alleging a student violated Reed’s Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct (DHSM) policy and the Honor Principle by physically harassing and threatening two Community Safety Officers (CSOs). In addition, the respondent allegedly violated Reed College’s Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) policy by becoming severely intoxicated and attempting to drive their vehicle on campus. The Judicial Board found the respondent had violated the Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy by physically and verbally threatening a Community Safety Officer. The Board also found that the respondent violated the Honor Principle by attempting to drive while intoxicated, putting fellow community members in a position where they had to prevent the respondent from driving intoxicated for an extended time, and physically and verbally threatening a CSO.

The Board recommended the following sanctions:

* Write a reflective essay about how their behavior impacted their fellow community members.
* Meet with a Health and Counseling professional (or off-campus equivalent) to receive an assessment of their substance use.
* Participate in a meeting mediated by the Honor Council with the community members impacted by their actions (CSOs and students).
* The respondent was prohibited from living on-campus for their remaining time at Reed.
* The respondent was prohibited from attending Renn Fayre 2017, all future pool hall formals, and all future Beer Nation events.
* Disciplinary probation.

The President’s Designee upheld the Board’s findings and recommendations. 

The Judicial Board adjudicated a complaint brought by a faculty member alleging a violation of the Academic Conduct Policy. The student allegedly accessed course materials during an exam. The Board found the respondent had violated the Academic Misconduct Policy.  The Board also found that the respondent acted less than honorably by not voluntarily coming forward when the course instructors sent a request to the entire class asking any student who used prohibited resources on the exam to talk to them.

The Board recommended the respondent be placed on disciplinary probation for the remainder of their time at Reed. The President’s designee upheld the Board’s findings and recommendations. 

A Temporary Hearing Board adjudicated a complaint filed by a staff member against a student for repeated AOD Policy violations. The Board found that the student had violated the Honor Principle by repeatedly violating the AOD policy.

The Board recommended that the student be placed on disciplinary probation for the remainder of their time at Reed and banned from living in the residence halls for the academic year. Further violations of the AOD policy would result in a permanent ban from living in or visiting Reed College-owned housing. In addition, the Board recommended that the student meet with a designated staff member to discuss the impact of their actions on the community. The President’s Designee upheld the Board’s recommendation with the additional stipulation that the student must also see a medical professional for an alcohol and drug use evaluation.

The Title IX Board heard a complaint filed by a student against another student for repeated sexual assault, stalking, violation of Campus Exclusion, and violation of a No Contact Order. The board was unable to determine if there was a violation of the DHSM policy. The Board found no dishonorable violation of Campus Exclusion, but maintained the No Contact Order between the two students.  

The Board found that sanctions would be appropriate, but recommended no further sanctions for the respondent as they could not impose any meaningful sanctions on top of the respondent’s permanent Campus Exclusion.
