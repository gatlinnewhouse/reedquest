Ah, the first week of spring semester. The sweet memory of Paideia classes I meant to go to and sleeping ‘til noon is still crisp on the pillowy surface of my conscious; my bike’s flat tire is freshly fixed and my closet is full of new sweaters purchased from my favorite San Diego thrift store. Classes are still exciting and I don’t scoff internally at the delusional idea that this will be the best semester yet and I’ll never get burnt-out ever. I’ve been to every senate meeting and have yet to skip the reading for any of my classes. Life is good.

For now, at least. It’s a straight shot from here to Spring Break and I’m sure at some point over the next seven weeks disillusionment will start setting in. I’m fairly positive I’ll start putting less effort into understanding my French reading assignments, begin deciding that 60 percent comprehension is probably good enough, and stop printing out the linguistics reading assignments altogether. Before long, a semi-permanent scowl will take residence on my face and I’ll start justifying liquid lunches (hey, Don Draper, hey).

I’m really hoping this won’t happen, though, so I’ve decided to take active steps to prevent the typical mid-semester meltdown. I’m going to distill this feeling of doe-eyed enthusiasm and keep it in a little bottle tucked safely in my room. If I get too stressed or tired or depressed, I’ll grab that little bottle and take a swig à la Felix Felicis.

“Oh. Haha, tee-hee, ho-ho, giggle-snort,” I hear you say, “He’ll never do it. We’re Reedies; being jaded is our thing. It’s like pederasty for the Greeks or anarchism for Noam Chomsky. Being jaded is our thing in the same way taking showers isn’t.”

Well, hyperbolically-clichéd Reedie/rhetorical straw man, I will do it.
  
There’s enough negativity on this campus that my small contribution won’t be missed. People will still complain about how much fucking work they have to do (#ughfml) instead of actually sitting down and doing it (#lolwut), dance parties and library crushes will still be sexual stalemates, and the collective (kollective?) vitamin D deficiency will still be a bummer.

But it doesn’t have to be this way! If I may wax Knudson-esque for a moment: Get up and reclaim your happiness, Reedies. Throw off the shackles of scholastic solemnity and smile. Smile, goddamn it, smile! We are a community – a family – and we can’t allow ourselves to be composed entirely of angsty, Hawthorne-Heights-listening, frowny teens.

So I challenge you, Reedies, join me in my lofty pursuit. Let’s smile more, let’s stop complaining, and let’s get shit done. Let’s thrive.
