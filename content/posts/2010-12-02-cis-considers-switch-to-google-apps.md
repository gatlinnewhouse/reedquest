Reed’s Computing and Informational Services department is in talks with Google to implement Google Apps for Education on campus, with the focus currently on Google Calendar and Google Docs.

The transaction between the schools and Google involves much legal review, which is underway.

Along with other colleges with similar concerns, and their attorneys, the language in the standard contract is being altered to strengthen the language.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, requires educational institutions to protect the privacy of students. “We want to bind them, require them to exercise as much diligence with data, and provide the security against hacking that we provide on this campus,” says Marty Ringle, Chief Technology Officer at the CIS department.

The current software is expensive and can be accessed only by administrators, whereas faculty and students would be able to use Google Calendar to schedule appointments. Ringle points out that the more people that are using the software, the more efficient it is.

Google Docs, a service that many students already use, would also be more user-friendly and protected under this contractual agreement. Kerberos credentials would apply, removing the hazard of data mining. Also, the shared domain would make it easy to search for and communicate with other Reed students, faculty, and staff.

Ringle noted the unease with implementing GMail expressed by many in the campus-wide CIS survey conducted mid-October. “Usually stemming from faculty and staff, concerns over privacy were also voiced by students. Regardless of age differences, people trust Reed and CIS to Google for processing and holding their mail.”

“We have to be mindful of everyone’s views, we can’t just take a majority vote. [&#8230;] To the extent that we can reassure people with concerns, we will take the technological and legal approaches.” Ringle cited easy and reliable encryption as an option to accommodate those with privacy concerns.

CIS expects Google Calendar and Google Docs to be available starting January 2011.
