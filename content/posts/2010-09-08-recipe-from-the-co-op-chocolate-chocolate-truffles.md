Chocolate is one of the main food groups, along with garlic, olive oil, and red wine. The friend who taught me this recipe (which I then forgot to write down and made up again later for a friend’s birthday) insisted that it ought to be done only with Hershey’s chocolate. I like to use the pound-plus bars from Trader Joe’s because they’re pleasantly inexpensive and very good quality, in my opinion. Also, since the recipe calls for a pound of chocolate, you get the extra ounce and a bit to tide yourself over while they set.

Yield: Enough to share!

1 lb. chocolate (dark, milk, whatever your preference)
  
1 tsp. vanilla
  
1 whole egg
  
4-5 egg yolks (save the whites for meringue or a protein-        filled scramble)
  
1/4-1/2 stick butter (or margarine)
  
Cocoa powder for rolling (you can also use ground nuts or         shredded coconut)

  1. Melt chocolate in a double boiler.
  2. Transfer to bowl. If you have a stand mixer, it’s very helpful because this is a bitch to stir, though according to the originator of this recipe, they come out best if stirred by hand with a wooden spoon in a copper bowl.
  3. Add vanilla.
  4. Mix in eggs, not all at once.
  5. Add butter and stir until it absorbs.
  6. Let the chocolate goo sit in the fridge for an hour or so. It will be fairly solid and workable when it’s ready. Shape into balls and roll in cocoa powder.
