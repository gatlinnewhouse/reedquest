Unlike Olde Reed, KRRC is not dead. Open your computers and turn to KRRCfm.com. Reed has a student radio station and it’s streaming online, said station signators Alexa Ross and Jack Diboise.

Yet not all is rosy with KRRC; though the station is professionally equipped and has more than seventy shows scheduled, station managers found out last fall that KRNQ, a rock station in Eugene owned by Cumulus Media, may move onto KRRC’s 97.9 FM frequency at any time.

No frequencies are currently available in Portland, but Gray Haertig ‘73, an alumnus of the engineering firm Gray Fierson Haertig & Associates, is working pro bono to find a space while KRNQ is held up in a legal challenge.

“The short answers is we don’t know,” Haertig said.

KRRC’s 10-watt signal could find a new home between two frequencies if it can get permission from both stations, Haertig said. He is currently inquiring with KUFO, 101.1 FM, and KINK, 101.9 FM, because they are owned by the same company.

This will be the station’s fourth frequency, Haertig said. When the broadcasting license came up for renewal in 2005 KRRC’s signator tossed out the Federal Communications Commission notice, said Kristin Holmberg, Director of Student Activities. The renewal was filed at the last minute with Haertig’s help.

“He’s saved us multiple times,” Holmberg said.

If KNRQ moves in before a new frequency is found, KRRC will lose its license, Diboise said.

“We’ll go web-only, but it’s important that we stay on the air as long as possible,” Diboise said.

The station has also received a lot of attention recently for drug violations.

Community Safety Officers often smell pot when walking by and find drug paraphernalia, said Gary Granger, Director of Community Safety. Thought eleven violations have occurred there so far this semester, no violations have occurred there in the last week.

“It has more of our attention now,” Granger said.

KRRC’s signators actively fight smoking in the station, Ross and Diboise said.

Signators sign a contract stating that they will respect the space and may lose their use privileges if they create problems, Diboise said. No students have lost access this year.

“One of the reasons I came to Reed was because it had a good student-run radio station. I disagree [that students just do drugs there],” Ross said.

Student DJs can now access the station at any time. Access could be restricted to specific hours, but the stations signators have opted against it.

“We try to keep the space as open as possible, but with freedom comes the power to make poor choices,” Diboise said.
