_Note: Because this week’s Senate meeting took place during Xeno’s memorial, this beat is based off of notes provided by the lovely Senate Secretary, Martha Janicki._ 

The meeting opened with the President’s message and the on to Committee Reports!
  
Basically, no one had anything to report. We didn’t get an update on what the Trustees talked about while on campus this weekend because Senator Levin resigned (due, according to his facespace status, to time constraints. Playin’ the T-card, eh?). Maybe he’ll email senate his meeting notes and we’ll find out next week&#8230;plz?

Senator Carlisle had big AOD Committee (alcohol and other drugs) news! There will be an external review of Reed’s alky and drug policies, enforcement, and the whatnot. The AOD Comm. will be putting together a team of notable alcohol and drug researchers who will come to campus sometime nearer the end of the semester. Mike Brody suggested April 20th or Renn Fayre as a good time for them to review our policies. Lolz. You forgot Nitrogen Day, Brody!

Carlisle also wants you to apply for J-Board, Appeals Board, Nitrogen Day Czar, and Diversity Committee. all of ‘em.

Mz. Nora met with Colin and some trustees. I think they talked about Reed Unions, which haven’t happened in forever but are a cool concept. Basically, you get the whole Reed community to come together and talk about some cool issue. \*shrug\*

Mr. Gester read off preliminary finance committee allocations where they zero funded Fire on the Quad. WHHHHHY!?

JC Dubs talked about HA and theme dorm deadlines that will have passed by the time you read this so I hope that you got your shit in on time if that’s what you want to do with your life. She also apparently mentioned something about new HA protocol concerning smoking in the dorms. QUE?! Tell me more!!!

Shawn Flanigan, SU asst. manager extrodinair, presented SU Committee’s plans to build an awning over the SU porch! This is motivated from a lot of the discussions about cutting down on smoking (pot/weed) in the SU. Doubly nice because now we’ll all have more shelter from the rain during bad songs at SU dance parties! And in previous discussions the possibility of heaters have been brought up to encourage people to actually go outside and smoke under the awning instead of the SU. Someone was also confused as to whether it actually was illegal to smoke in the SU&#8230; yes, it is actually illegal to smoke in the SU.

Finally, a couple of kids showed up to ask senate for permission to advertise off campus.
  
Which brings me to the most exciting news from this senate meeting: The Foundation is returning to Reed!!!!!!! For all of you who don’t know what this is, get stoked. For one night, our SU turns into something like the biggest b-boy battle in the NW. IM. SO. STOKED.
