In a significant decision Saturday October 2, the Reed Board of Trustees approved the college’s first official Statement of Diversity at their annual fall summit.

The positive vote from the trustees heralded the final hurdle for a document nearly two years in the making. While the Statement underwent a number of revisions before finally reaching the trustees, Kathy Rose, Executive Assistant to the President, confirmed that “the board approved the Statement as passed by the Faculty and Student Senate.”

Mike Brody, Dean of Student Services, was present during the session and described the general response to the language of the Statement as “unobjectionable.”

The birth of the Statement speaks highly of the power of student initiative at Reed.

Prompted by the discovery of racist graffiti in a bathroom in the Naito/Sullivan dorms in early February 2009, Zoe Kipping ’11 organized a discussion around bigotry, the Honor Principle, and the limitations of free speech at Reed for the following week. To her surprise, more than sixty students crowded into Winch/Capehart on a cold and dark Wednesday night to discuss their reactions to the incident.

Eighteen students returned the following Wednesday to begin the arduous process of drafting a Statement of Commitment to Diversity and a complementary long-term “Diversity Action Plan” for measuring this commitment in concrete terms over the next ten years.

Adriel Hsu-Flanders ’12 emphasized the role of discussion and comparison in the early steps of the process. “We looked around at our peer institutions and the types of statements they had on their websites and as part of their mission statements. From there we talked about the ways to put the things that we hoped to see espoused by our school into one document.”

An email list was set up under the generic title “Coalition” and versions of the documents flew back and forth throughout February and March. “It was a really painful process,” laughed Hsu-Flanders, “you never know how difficult some wording can be.”

While the action plan lost its momentum after a series of informal revisions, the group was ready to present a draft of the Statement to the Student Senate at an open meeting on April 13, 2009.

After two weeks of debate, Senate passed a revised version of the Statement of Diversity in an 8-1 vote, ratifying it as a governing document of the student body on April 21, 2009. By December, it had been reviewed by the Community Affairs Committee and the Reed faculty and, with minor edits, returned to Senate for final approval.

While the mere necessity of such a statement became of a subject of serious debate within the student body, discussion amongst the faculty and staff of the college was markedly different.

Brody explained that, while some students argued that the Honor Principle already implied the sentiments covered by the Statement, “in this day and age, the vast majority of grown-ups take it for granted. If anything, the question was ‘why don’t we already have one?’”

Ratification by the Board of Trustees places the Statement on par with the Community Constitution and the Reed Institute Bylaws.

Hsu-Flanders hopes the Statement will be made as accessible as possible to both current and future students.

“I know as a student of color and someone who’s interested in these sorts of issues, it was one of the first things I looked for on a school’s website. In this day and age if its not there it comes across as a major lack,” he said.

In light of the Statement’s adoption, Brody feels confident about the college’s future commitment to issues of inclusion.

“The nature of the conversation has only grown more serious and substantive about how the college is going to engage with issues of diversity,” he said.

The President’s Office is working with the faculty Diversity Committee on further methods of distributing the document. It will be added faculty handbook and available on the Reed website in the near future.
