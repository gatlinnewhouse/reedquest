To the Editors:

I found much to admire in Miles Jochem’s thoughtful piece about heroin at Reed, especially his belief that heroin use is intrinsically dishonorable.
  
But I disagree with one important point. Citing statistics about heroin use in Portland, Miles states that heroin is inevitable and that we should therefore focus our energy on mitigating its horrible effects.

I think there’s a whiff of complacency about that approach. I see no reason why we should accept heroin use at Reed, any more than we would accept rabies, polio, tuberculosis, or cholera—diseases that were once the scourge of Portland but are now reduced to asterisks because the city was determined to stamp them out.

Of course we should mitigate the effects of heroin. Of course we should help users get treatment. But fundamentally, as a community of honor, we should do everything in our power to \*prevent\* one other from succumbing to the nightmare of addiction in the first place. You don’t fight cholera with gatorade and a shrug. You fight it with soap, sewers, and a conviction that the epidemic can be stopped.

&#8220;Diversity at Reed: The Quotes That Didn&#8217;t Make it Online&#8221;

If you didn&#8217;t read SBInfo, Reed has launched a new diversity ad campaign website. The following are quotes that didn&#8217;t make it online:

&#8220;What diversity at Reed means to me: &#8216;I don&#8217;t give a crap who is sitting next to me at the library, so long as they are quiet'&#8221;

&#8220;At Reed, diversity means not judging you by the color of your skin or your religion &#8230; it means judging you based on how dumb your comments are in conference&#8221;

&#8220;If I&#8217;m drunk enough, I&#8217;ll sleep with just about anyone&#8221;

&#8220;Reedies like to think post-economic status, so a lot of us don&#8217;t shower or do laundry to feel in touch with the common man&#8221;

&#8220;The only label that matters is Pabst Blue Ribbon&#8221;

And at least one faculty provided the following insight:

&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be at a place where all the students treat their peers equally. By which I mean they all assume they know more than everyone else.&#8221;

Thought Exercise

1) Think of the reaction most Reedies have when you mention a (hypothetical) puppy being kicked.

2) Think of the reaction most people have when you mention a (hypothetical) person being sexually assaulted.

3) Consider that, at Reed, we are far more likely to know a womyn who&#8217;s been raped than a puppy who&#8217;s been kicked.

Dear Freshmen,

It&#8217;s the time of year when your board plans are fat and the scrounge is thin. We ask for this: a cheese quesadilla, a plate of mac and cheese, and maybe some fries. Maybe we&#8217;ll even buy you beer.

P.S. None of that vegan shit.
