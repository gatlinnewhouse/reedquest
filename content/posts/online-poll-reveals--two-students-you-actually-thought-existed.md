Recently, overwhelming evidence has called into question the existence of two so-called “Reed students,” Ben Read and Ted Hume. “Ben Read?” said someone who I can’t quite remember but I’m pretty sure had red hair. “The name’s just so average he can’t possibly be a real person.” 

“Oh, I know of Ted Hume,” said another. "Or, at least I know of someone who knows of him, I can’t quite recall … come to think of it, I don’t know anyone who’s ever actually interacted with him.”

An anonymous online poll addressed the sweeping calls for investigation into the corporeality of these enigmatically average students. Results are as follows:

To the question, “Who is Ted Hume?” 37% claimed the name referred to an “umbrella brand”, 39% responded “Ghost of Herodotus’ son who haunts Vollum Lecture Hall,” 21% responded “other,” and only 3% answered “Reed Student.”

For a similar survey published about Ben Read, 52% answered “My second cousin’s brother-in-law who I supposedly met at my cousin Mary’s wedding but just can’t quite call to mind,” 22.1% thought he was a “permanent fixture in the Admissions Office,” 15.6% responded “John Kroger’s pen name,” and only 0.3% considered him an actual Reed student. 

Reed College classics professor Wally Englert commented, “As far as I know there’s always been a Ted Hume at Reed. It would just feel wrong if there wasn’t one.” Some students reported seeing Ben Read’s name on several student publications, but Claire Pask, active in the _Quest,_ the _Grail_, and the _Creative Review_ cleared up this mystery as well. “Ben Read is just a by-line we use when no one else wants to accept responsibility for an article,” she admitted.

Not one person interviewed could name a time they’d actually interacted with either Ben Read or Ted Hume. When searching “Ted Hume” on the campus directory, all that came up was a flashing troll face on the screen. “Ben Read” produced no results at all.

Considering the data, it is clear these two bland-named phantasms are in fact _not_ real students. Any students who find themself under the misguided assumption they are actually interacting with them should double-check they are not in fact being targeted by Kroger propaganda or being haunted by the ghost of Herodotus’ son.
