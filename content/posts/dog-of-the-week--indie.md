This week’s featured doggo is Indie: an 80 pound hug machine. Indie is a giant blue poodle and is taken care of by his human, Corrina del Valle ’20. Both Corrina and Indie spent their summer near campus, and they can often be seen walking near the rugby field. Indie has one baby brother, an Aussie labradoodle named Logan who lives with the rest of the del Valle family. 

Indie is very, very good at receiving hugs. His favorite things to do include playing in water and solving his puzzle toys. He is a very smart doggo, so smart that he might even get to go to class with all of us this year! His human is hoping to get permission from Disability Support Services to bring Indie to lectures. This would also allow Indie and Corrina to spend more time together. Indie loves Corrina so much that he gets nervous without her. “He can’t ever be alone. He loves people too much,” says del Valle. “Indie is the most high-strung, stressed out ball of fluff ever, but when he is here, he is just so much calmer. We can be stressed balls of fluff together, and it balances out because we both have someone to kinda mitigate that.” Hopefully, we will get to see Indie and Corrina in class together this semester. He is so excited to come learn with us!
