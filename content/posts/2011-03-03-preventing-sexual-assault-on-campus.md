_Feminist Student Union and The Sexual Assault Taskforce Provide Some Tips_

Reed culture takes pride in being unique. It’s not like other colleges, and that makes it more difficult to pinpoint aspects of rape culture. We don’t have boisterous frat parties with kegs and red plastic cups. Our atmosphere is more or less communal and comfortable, but there is danger in that, too—a lack of awareness.

Any person (any gender) can be sexually assaulted.  Any person (any gender) can commit sexual assault.  It involves violating someone’s boundaries, intentionally or unintentionally.

The most direct way to prevent sexual assault in your own interactions is to actively use consent.  In the broadest sense, consent is communication with your partner about your boundaries.  It can be practiced through heartfelt discussions, or straightforward questions in the heat of the moment.  “No” can be said in many ways; wait for an uninhibited “yes!”

The act of sexual assault does not necessarily imply the use physical force, (though very violent sexual assault is a reality, even at Reed).  It can come from poor communication, crossed boundaries, a lack of consent—from ignorance.  As Reed community members, it is our responsibility to confront that ignorance.  By being conscious of our own actions and the actions of those around us, we can prevent sexual assault.

I do not want to discount the impact of sexual assault as a violent action; it is a traumatic experience, regardless of intent or use of force.  The idea that sexual assault is always an attack perpetrated by a person with violent intentions can erase or invalidate the experiences of survivors of less overtly violent forms of sexual assault. The premise that sexual assault always hinges on physical violence allows us to push it away as something foreign, something that doesn’t happen here.

Most people can now reject the stereotype of the armed rapist lurking in the bushes, waiting to prey on the next woman who jogs past. We can accept that the perpetrator is usually a person the survivor knows, but it is still often assumed to be someone with malicious intent, a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

A survivor of sexual assault has experienced something confusing and traumatizing. The act may have been committed by someone the survivor loves or cares for, a friend or an acquaintance; someone who wasn’t fully conscious of the boundaries they crossed.  It can be dangerous to presume that all those who have committed sexual assault are villains. This is not to say that they should not be prosecuted or held accountable for their actions, but this label can hinder a survivor’s ability to recognize what happened to them as sexual assault. In the face of villainizing another person, survivors often blame themselves.

The most important way you can support survivors is to validate them.  If a friend comes to you with a questionable sexual encounter, listen to them!  We live in a relentlessly victim-blaming culture. They may be swimming through waves of their own self-doubt. They had the courage to speak, and the first response they hear should be confirmation. Tell them to trust their instincts; try and give them a sense of control. If someone feels as though they have been violated, then they have been violated. This is not something that you can intellectualize.

Reedies, please open your eyes. This happens here. Talk about it. Care for one another. Think with your hearts.
