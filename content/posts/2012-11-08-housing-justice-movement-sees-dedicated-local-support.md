Reedies, high school students, and other citizens of Portland were recently pepper-sprayed in two different protests addressing flaws in the US economic system. The students asked not to be named, due to potential legal action from the law enforcement. According to the press releases from the Multnomah County Sheriff&#8217;s Office, in both instances the police were threatened and pushed with signs. A Reedie present at both protests said that the police were never in physical danger from the protesters.

On Nov. 3, a march in NE Portland gathered support against austerity measures. The protesters rejected the idea that funding for basic services should be cut while military funding continues to increase, and corporations are given increased subsidies. These cuts to services that affect people’s day to day survival are clearly visible in the problem of housing justice. Andrew Barney ’13 explained that banks see “houses not as things people should live in, but things to make money off of.” There, again,  he says, there is a conflict between the interests of human services and the interests of the financial system.

The goal of the action according to Milo Duë ‘13 is “to change what people consider to be the moral emergency.” Barney explained that people equate a debt to the bank to a personal debt, which if left unpaid leave a moral and economic void for someone else to fill. Barney expressed that instead of a system of losing money, this unpaid debt is an opportunity for the banks to make money.

The banks profit from the start, as homeowners pay interest on their mortgage. They profit again when they sell the mortgage to another financial institution. Finally, when the house is foreclosed, they make a profit evicting the inhabitants.

One case is Patricia Williams. She was forced to take a medical retirement, at which point she submitted the paperwork to modify her mortgage based on her reduced income. After a year of unreturned communication, the bank reported that they lost the paperwork, and Williams resubmitted it. In that time, the mortgage was sold to another company, who began foreclosure procedures and moved them out of their house with little warning. Williams and her husband challenged the eviction in court, but that didn’t help. Eventually, they moved back into their house against the ruling, but with the support of the neighborhood.

The situation is turned around by the moral climate of the country, where people are accused of asking for handouts when they run into trouble. Barney said, “most people are only a few paychecks away from the same situation.” Axcelle Bell ’13 spoke about how real and close the problems become when employing direct action against them. “I think it’s important because it’s directly helping people who are affected,” said Bell, “It helps you get clarity on the problem.”

The housing justice movement has been gaining traction in Chicago, the Bay Area, Atlanta, and Portland as well. Barney said that it had absorbed “a lot of the energy that has come out of the occupy movement.” 5 houses were re-inhabited by the families that owned them in Portland, though two were forcibly evicted with the help of law enforcement in the last few weeks.

In one case, the police arrived at a house while a man was walking his daughter to the bus stop, and evicted them that day. The other eviction occurred on Oct 30, when Patricia Williams and her husband were evicted from their house by the police. Williams had enough time to call for people to resist their forcible eviction. The police did not allow protesters into the house, though an attempted entry resulted in the use of pepper spray and the arrest of a protester.

We Are Oregon, a nonprofit organization, created the rapid response phone network that Williams used to bring immediate support when there was a threat of eviction. In other cases, people have occupied the house and camped in the yard in solidarity with the family. Duë said that she saw “people who aren’t in the activist circuit being involved for the first time.”

Students who want to join the Rapid Response Network that We Are Oregon uses to alert people when a family is threatened with eviction can text @ploc-openrrn to 23559. People on the RRN will be told an address to go to, and a group will amass to try to keep the families in their homes. Though protesters have been pepper sprayed and one has been arrested in the course of these actions, it is also easy to bear witness without any risk to one’s body or freedom, say members of the RRN.
