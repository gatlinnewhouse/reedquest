The current Quest editors (who were won that position in an uncontested election) have made a decision about what kind of newspaper they want to run.  They want the Quest to be taken seriously; they want it to be viewed as a legitimate source of news.  This is no doubt a respectable and well-intentioned goal.  But they have committed themselves to these ends so fully that they have failed to recognize the essential inappropriateness of this goal.

You may wonder why this is an inappropriate goal for the school newspaper to have.  The answer is that Reed College is very different from the United States of America.  Obviously we are part of the U.S.A., but we are also distinct in a very important way. This is a community governed by the Honor Principle, which means that by entering this community we have all consented to relinquish certain freedoms that are guaranteed to us by our country’s constitution.

It may seem counter intuitive or hard to swallow, but the Honor Principle is a doctrine of unfreedom. (Here I’m paraphrasing a Peter Steinberger article “What is an Honor Principle?” If you haven’t read this I implore you to track it down and do so.)

In this community, we don’t have the freedom to say or write whatever we want.

On the contrary, we have to exercise considerable restraint in our daily lives to ensure that we are not causing undue harm to our community.  A newspaper that indiscriminately reports on the news is necessarily not showing considerable restraint.

What happens when reporting on the news indiscriminately could potentially hurt the community?  There are wonderful and positive things about Reed that need to stay hidden from the outside world in order to be able to continue to exist.

Furthermore, some things need to stay hidden from the administration so that liability concerns do not force them to intervene.  (Liability concerns will ruin this college as they will ruin just about everything else in the world.  Our trigger-happy propensity to sue has made this a country hostile to having institutions that are fun.) But I digress.

The point is, there will be times when reporting on “the news” could hurt this community.  To not cover these stories would undermine the legitimacy of the Quest as a newspaper.  To go ahead and report anyway would undermine the Quest as a community entity bound by the honor principle.  A serious dilemma indeed!

What will the Quest decide to do in these situations?  What if they allow their goal of becoming a legitimate newspaper to obstruct their ability to adequately consider the potential future consequences to the community? What if they decide to report?

To make matters worse, there are no institutional mechanisms for preemptively
  
challenging that decision and thereby preventing the publication of an
  
article.  The Honor Council and J-Board can only react after the damage has
  
been done. So then what mechanisms do we, as a community, have for checking
  
the Quest editors decisions in these types of situations?

You may object that what I’m looking for is a mechanism for censorship.  I will happily cede that point &#8211; censorship is exactly what I am advocating.  But the Honor Principle requires nothing less than this.  We all must remain open to censoring ourselves for the good of the community.

The Quest editors, more than the average Reedie, must be prepared to censor themselves in these kinds of situations. They must try to anticipate any and all potential consequences to the community that could arise down the line due to the publication of an article.  This situation is exasperated by the recent decision of the Quest to go online with their publication.  Given this recent change it is all the more necessary for the Quest to actively work with this community to determine what is, and what is not, acceptable for publication.

To conclude, the Quest editors are committed to the goal of being a legitimate source of news and thus have committed to reporting indiscriminately on the happenings of the community. I think their intentions are good, and I think it is good for the community to have a legitimate source of news.

However, in situations where their duties as journalists come into conflict with their duties as community members bound by the Honor Principle, the Honor Principle must remain foremost if it is to remain at all.  If this means occasionally having to refrain from publishing certain articles to be honorably cautious at the expense of being a “legitimate” newspaper then so be it.  The good of the community demands nothing less.
