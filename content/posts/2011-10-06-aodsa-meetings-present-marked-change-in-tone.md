“Since the beginning of the school year, three freshmen have been found alone and severely intoxicated,” said Community Safety Director Gary Granger. “One of them was found in the canyon.”

The room fell silent. And then, questions. “Three?” “Really?” “Are you joking?” To quote Mike Brody, students were “viscerally dismayed” that Reedies had been left alone while dangerously intoxicated.  Some Reedies are clearly disheartened by the fact that there have been seven medical transports this year (compared to one last year), as well as five reported sexual assaults (compared to one last year). However, all present, students and administrators, noted that they weren&#8217;t sure about the causes of the increase in reported incidents. It could be due to better reporting of AOD-related emergencies (due to the Medical Amnesty Policy) and the better system in place for reporting of sexual assaults.

The discussion that followed Granger’s statement covered the role of the Honor Principle in dealing with community members in danger, as well as in everyday actions such as “not playing your music too loud.” Students discussed ways to emphasize that the Honor Principle was meant to encourage positive relations with community members, not just as a barrier to personal responsibility. It was generally agreed upon that leaving severely intoxicated Reedies alone was not only wrong, but something that shouldn&#8217;t ever happen.

The most striking thing about this meeting was the marked change in tone from meetings about AOD and sexual assault last year. The students spoke with the administration more as ones speaking to peers and less as enraged outsiders speaking to a distant administration. The administration responded in kind. ****Brody noted that, “This meeting is entirely different. Some of the meetings last year were very, very contentious, although not universally so.” The meetings were even different in subject matter: rather than outlining the problems with Reed policy, the meetings this year have focused on constructive ways to apply the Honor Principle to our everyday lives.

There are two visible reasons for this. The first is that the administration, having learned from some of their mistakes, have taken an approach that seems to be more about dialoging and working with students than trying to control what they do. Granger himself spoke about wanting to write an op-ed for the Quest encouraging students to take better care of each other, but didn&#8217;t want to come off as “scolding.” The medical amnesty policy, which has been invoked ten times so far this year, also seems to have built better relations between Community Safety and the students.

The students also were more interested in constructive measures than destructive ones. Rather than talking about getting rid of the AOD policy or “resisting” the CSOs, there was talk of trying to find ways to encourage Reedies to see the positive part of the Honor Principle. The emphasis on the Honor Principle as a call to acting better, rather than as a way to eschew personal responsibility, was notable.

The tone of this meeting, which emphasized healthy relationships between students, was significantly more constructive than that of the meetings in the last year. Brody said, “If the Honor Principle is purely reactive its just another way of solving problems. The Honor Principle is instead about treating others well.” Hopefully, the outcome of this recent spike in medical transports will be a returned emphasis to the most important part of the Honor Principle in our everyday lives.
