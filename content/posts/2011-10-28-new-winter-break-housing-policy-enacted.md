Residence Life is now allowing any and all students to say over winter break for a price of $250. In the past, only students who lived outside the United States have been able to stay at Reed over winter break. This policy left domestic students who could not afford to go home or who had problems at home without anywhere to live. For some students, this price is a relief compared to the price of a plane ticket. But for others, its a burden that used to be nonexistent.

Assistant Dean of Residence Life David Rivera emphasized that the primary reason for the change was equity. &#8220;We realized that many domestic students did not have the means to go home over break.&#8221; The fee was added because students would claim that they were planning on staying over break and back out at the last minute. Residence Life felt that people would be more careful about their decision to stay over break if there was a fee associated with their housing.

Certain students have expressed concerns about the housing fee. Housing Director Amy Shuckman and Rivera made it clear that they understood students concerns, but thought the price change was necessary. &#8220;People are understandably upset when something that used to be free costs money,&#8221; said Rivera. Rivera stated that the $250 cost was deliberate: they wanted it to be cheaper than a plane ticket home, and an amount that a student who was working over break could conceivably pay. For students without a source of income, emergency loans are available from the financial aid office.
  
The added funds and the (possibly) increased number of students will make living on campus over break easier than in the past. More buildings will be open, an HA will be present over break, facilities will have extra staff – they may even add a student employee. However, food options will be still be extremely limited on campus.

However, it seems the price has cut down the number of applicants. Only one student attended the information sessions about winter housing. Residence life received only twenty-four applications, which is an decrease from the number in past years, which Shuckman said was in the &#8220;lower 30s” &#8211; and that was when only international students could apply. However, a full one third of this years&#8217; winter housing applicants were domestic students, showing that the program has filled a definite need for some students.
  
As this is the first year of the new housing system, Rivera and Shuckman were unsure about what to expect. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to create [policy] structures that make sense,&#8221; said Rivera.  Shuckman added, &#8220;This is the first year we&#8217;re doing this, and we want to hear suggestions on how to improve.&#8221;
