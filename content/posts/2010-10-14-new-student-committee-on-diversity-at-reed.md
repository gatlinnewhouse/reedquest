_Senate Formally Addresses Issues_

Student Senate unanimously voted to create a student diversity committee at a meeting Tuesday, October 12. The ten-student committee will present issues pertaining to diversity and inclusion to Student Senate, and will write a report on the state of diversity at the college every semester.

“The committee should be charged with making sure that diverse opinions aren’t stifled, that student groups are coming together, and that students who are working on diversity issues on campus are supported,” said Austin Campbell, vice president of the student body.

Officially, the committee will present issues pertaining to diversity and inclusion to Senate, foster initiatives on diversity issues, and act as a liaison between the MRC, diversity-related student groups, the faculty diversity committee, and Student Senate.

Though the committee was voted into existence last spring, Senate deemed its language and structure inappropriate. The committee would be composed of two senators and eight students, appointed through appointments committee. The diversity committee will meet with the faculty diversity committee once a semester to discuss issues affecting both communities.

“The fact is that Reed is becoming more and more diverse and that creates pressures and conflicts. I think it would be nice that the student body had a group devoting time to mediating and diminishing those conflicts,” said Luca Provenzano, student senator.

The diversity commitee will meet at least once every two weeks and be open to the whole Reed community.

Language regarding the committee will be codified in the bylaws, said Senator Nina Showell.

“Historically bigger student committees are codified in the bylaws,” she said.

Appointments will be open later this semester. Students will hold one-year terms and be staggered so that four new students are appointed each semester.
