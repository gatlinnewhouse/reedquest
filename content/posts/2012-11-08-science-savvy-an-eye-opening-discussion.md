This is a story of two scientists, Vincent and Samantha, who were wrapped up in controversy over whether stem cells exist in adult human eyes. In 2000, a high profile paper identified stem cells in a specific part of the eye called the pigmented ciliary margin (PCM), which encircles the outermost edge of the retina. Stem cells are cells with “blank slates.” They self-renew and have the potential to produce many different types of cells. If there are indeed stem cells hidden in the PCM, they could be stimulated to repair damaged eyes and possibly cure blindness! Nine years and millions of research dollars later, a very careful study demonstrated that the cells identified nine years ago were not stem cells. We imagine that if the two authors of these opposing studies were ever to meet, they might have a conversation like the one below:

    Two distinct models for how to make cells that could repair damaged eyes. A: Tropepe’s model in which retinal stem cells from the PCM multiply to form colonies and then mature into specialized retinal cells. B: Cicero’s model in which the cells that Tropepe believed were stem cells are actually the adult pigmented cells that make up the PCM. As recent research has shown, these cells are capable of multiplying and “transdifferentiating” into specialized retinal cells, but only in the right conditions.

**Samantha Cicero (author of 2009 paper):** Vincent, you told us all that you found stem cells in the eye. I’ve wasted many years trying to turn your cells into retinal cells that would help restore vision. I can’t do it. I’ve tried everything! Now I know why. The cells you thought were stem cells are no such thing. They’re simply the normal pigmented cells found in PCM. What do you have to say for yourself?

**Vincent Tropepe (author of the 2000 paper):** Sammy, I isolated cells from the PCM and watched them self-renew. I saw it with my own two eyes! This is exactly what stem cells do. These _are_ stem cells.

**SC:** But stem cells are not the only type of cell that can make copies of themselves.

**VT:** I know, but my cells even had the chemical characteristics of stem cells!

**SC:** Like the stem cell-associated molecule nestin? It’s true, your cells have nestin, but nestin is an unreliable stem cell marker. I showed that the appearance of nestin can be triggered by the solution you grew the cells in and that nestin-positive cells make normal pigmented cells. What’s more, your “stem cells” had the chemical and physical characteristics of normal pigmented cells, never really changing their appearance.

**VT:** Lies! Some of the progeny of the original cells I isolated _looked_ like retinal cells and expressed the some of the genes expressed by retinal neurons. Only stem cells could generate such diversity.

**SC**: I repeated your experiment, and it was very rare that I saw any cells that looked like anything but normal pigmented cells. If you had taken a closer look, you would have noticed that the elongated cells you saw didn’t even have nuclei. What you thought were photoreceptors was often simply cellular “garbage” – little bits of membrane. So none of the offspring were actual retinal cells. Even if they were, every cell was pigmented, making them useless for mammalian retinas. Pigmented cells block light, not let it in!

**VT:** Your results are pretty convincing&#8230; I see now that I should have approached my experiment more carefully and performed better controls. I’m sorry for sending you on a wild goose-eye chase over the last nine years. I just wanted to fit in with the other eye scientists.

**SC:** I forgive you. You’ve taught the world an important lesson: one must always set up necessary _controls_, like I did when I checked for pigmented cell markers in the offspring that you thought were photoreceptors. Sometimes, when scientists really want something to be true, they forget to cover all their bases. Live and learn!
