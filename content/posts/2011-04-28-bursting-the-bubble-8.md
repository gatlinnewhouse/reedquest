**Statue of Turkey-Armenia Friendship Being Demolished**

In an act akin to politically slapping someone in the face with a glove full of bricks, the Turkish government has begun to demolish a statue of two figures extending their hand to one another.  The so-called Statue of Humanity, commissioned in 2006 to symbolize the gradual warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia, could take as long as a week to demolish.  The sculptor, Mehmet Askoy, said that he is “sorry on behalf of Turkey,” and that while “They can demolish it, we will re-make it.”  This comes after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Ergodan’s January visit to the sculpture, during which he called the monument a “monstrosity,” and “weird.” For the uneducated, relations between Turkey and Armenia have been rather strained since WWI, when up to 1.5 million Armenians were systematically killed by various types of massacre and deportation; Turkey has opposed the label “genocide” since the country’s inception, arguing that considerable losses occurred on both sides of the conflict.

**Belgium Passes Their One-Year Anniversary of Having No Government**

Great news!  As of April 26th, 2010, Belgium has had no federal government.  Basically, the last political party to be in charge of government resigned after one of its coalition members pulled out, and the subsequent election resulted in no party having majority in the cabinet.  The largest political parties within the cabinet, also the largest parties from Belgium’s two regions, Flanders and Wallonia, are at odds due to Flanders wanting to secede.  European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has called the situation “extremely pitiful.”  Belgium will have to form a complete government within three months to create a long-term economic plan in order to accord with EU regulations.

**Money For Nothing**

According to a new report by the Congressional Research Service, as requested by Bernie Sanders (I-VT), big banks took out government loans at extremely low interest rates and then used that money to buy government debt at significantly higher interest rates.  In other words, the banks made a lot of money for doing nothing productive.  The Fed has set low interest rates to encourage banks to make loans to businesses and consumers, in order to promote economic growth during this period of difficulty for the economy; however, lending to households and small businesses actually decreased by over $500 billion in 2009.  Angry yet?

**Atlas Stumbled**

Box-office sales of the first installment of the film adaptation of Atlas Shrugged  dropped 47% this week, down from a respectable limited release profit of $1.7 million.  The film, dubbed “the most anticlimactic non-event since Geraldo Rivera broke into Al Capone’s vault” by Roger Ebert, also tanked critically, earning a mere 7% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  The film’s critical and financial failure prompted writer and producer John Aglialoro to announce having “deep second thoughts” on the production of parts 2 and 3.  Aglialoro spent 18 years and approximately $15 million on the project.

**How Do You Say “Great Escape” In Dari?**

Taliban insurgents succeeded in tunneling into an Afghan prison Sunday after more than five months of digging.  More than 480 prisoners ultimately escaped through the 1050 foot tunnel, which bypassed watch towers, security guards, and concrete walls.

Afghan Justice Minister Habibullah Ghaleb blamed Afghan security forces, who had searched the house containing the tunnel entrance 2 months before but failed to notice anything amiss.  “Earth or soil dug out of the tunnel must have been moved and should not have been missed by the eyes of the security forces,” said Ghaleb in a report to President Hamid Karzai.

**Trail Blazers Title**

In game four of the playoffs between the Portland Trail Blazers at the Dallas Mavericks, the Blazers managed a comeback from twenty-three points behind to win the game.  Not so in the fifth game, which also saw the Blazers going into the fourth quarter far behind the Mavericks. This time, the Mavericks’ best defense proved to be an incompetent offense, as the Trail Blazers missed ten shots in a row. This puts the series at 3-2 for the Mavericks, who need just one more win to triumph overall. On behalf of our city, we would like to wish our first professional sports team good luck, and express our sincere hope that they don’t screw up again.

**Those Old People, They Sure Love Their Health Care**

Don’t try to take away old people’s health care! They get super mad, as Republican members of Congress found out this week. The fortunately named Representative Daniel Webster from central Florida found himself being called a “liar” as audience members shouted at both him and each other at a town hall on Tuesday.  The uproar stems from general unrest regarding Paul Ryan’s proposed budget overhaul.  In fact, so many people were yelling at the town hall that a police officer intervened and said, “It’s not going to be solved by yelling and screaming and hollering. Let’s conduct ourselves like grown people.”  Mister police officer, you do know that Florida has a higher percentage of old-timers than any other state, right?

**14 Year Old Boy Shot at Lloyd Center Mall**

Maranatha Church in Northeast Portland overflowed with mourners Tuesday attending the funeral of 14 year old Shiloh Hampton, who was fatally shot outside of Lloyd Center on Wednesday April 18th.  Police believe the shooting was gang-related, although are unsure whether he was the intended target.  Pastor Joe Mullen, who spoke at the funeral, proclaimed “It’s time for the violence to end… God is not pleased with what’s going on.”  Police are still searching for the killers, who drove a lowered white Mercedes sedan from the late 80s, with tinted windows and chrome rims.  Exercise vigilance, dear Reedies.
