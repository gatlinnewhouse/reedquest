To determine the effect of prohibition upon the former patrons of saloons, five Reed College students, clad in the garments of laboring en, have been mingling for the past two weeks with the denizens of the North End, eating in the cheap Burnside street restaurants, and gambling for lunch checks with the &#8220;regular patrons&#8221; of the soft-drink cafes. The results of their investigation have just been made public.

Liquor, according to psychologists, is beneficial because it provides an outlet for emotions that are harmful is suppressed. The purpose of the student investigators was to find out what, if anything, is taking the place of liquor. Their answer is, &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;

Near beer and loganberry juice are not taking the place of alcohol in the hearts and stomachs of Burnside street society. The men interviewed by Alvin Shagren (and he specialized in this branch of the work) all said that they drank for effect, not for taste, and without the effect there was no drinking.

George Buland discovered that the sale of soft drinks has increased slightly since the state went dry, but that the increase in not great enough to be of importance. Neil Malarkey found that attendance at motion picture theatres has not increased except at one place on Burnside Street. North End pool halls investigated by Carl Rochet showed an increase in afternoon business, but a decrease in the evening. The total profits of these places have changed little since the coming of prohibition. Horace Miller discovered that restaurants have gained a very slight increase in business.

The drink dispensaries, though deprived of their former glory and the odor of spilt beer, seem to be as popular for loafing places as in the days of the flowing bowl, though they have been driven nearly to the wall by a lack of business. The dry cafe is a good place to sit and smoke and meet one&#8217;s friends on a cold, wet evening, but spending money for a drink without a &#8220;punch&#8221; seems to have little appeal. Proprietors of the largest saloons in the North End say that if it were not for the small traddic in lunch checks, they would be forced to close their doors.

The recent proposal of the city administration to stop the gambling for food checks in the dry cafes stirred the Reed College sociology department to action for this reason. If the gambling were stoped, it would mean the closing of places where men congregate. This action, it is believed, would be harmful to the men turn upon the street and to society in general.

The investigators encountered a number of obstacles in the way of accurate results. In the first place, prohibition has not been in effect long enough for resulting business conditions to become completely adjusted. Many men, too, have left town because of work which has started. Businessmen have not had time to determine the real eddects of the change, and the bad weather has also had its effect upon all business.

A thesis is to be written soon by George Buland upon the results of this investigation and it will be made public as soon as completed. The work done upon the problem of the effects of prohibition this winter is not meant to be final, but is the best that could be accomplished under existing conditions. It is expected that other students will continue to work with investigations and reports from time to time until the true effects of prohibition are known.

The chief result of the present investigation has been to determine that the men who formerly spent large sums for liquor are saving their money. Motion pictures and soft drinks are being substituted for intoxicants to a very slight extent, but for the most part the money formerly spent for liquor is now going for the necessities of life and support of families.
