**Candidate: John Iselin<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/iselin_pres_-2012/" rel="attachment wp-att-1882"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1882" title="John Iselin" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Iselin_Pres_-2012-225x300.jpeg?resize=225%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>**
  
**Position: President**

Ever since arriving in Portland two and a half years ago, I have been both excited and motivated by the community of scholars, activists, and thoughtful, engaged citizens that is Reed College. I firmly believe that I have the ability, experience, and resolve to give back to this campus through service as President of the Student Body. My experience &#8211; gained over my year as a student senator and my work in the Reed community &#8211; has prepared me for the three main tasks of the student body president. First, the president must, in the broadest sense, serve as senate’s moderator. Second, the president should be a resource for students with questions, comments, concerns or ideas about how to make the campus a better place. Third, the president is the primary representative of the student body in conversations with the administration. I have served the student body in a number of roles, including Senator, Appointments Committee Chair, signator of Queer Alliance, and manager of the US presidential election events that have taken place on campus over the last year. Each of these positions has given me a great deal of experience working with engaged and motivated students, faculty, and staff members in a number of roles. I feel comfortable both working in a community of equals and acting as a facilitator and moderator for the student body and senate.

I have always strive to uphold the honor principle and actively participate in our community while holding to the high academic standard that Reed College requires. I have the ability and motivation to perform the roles of the president with devotion and skill. My previous experience has prepared me well to focus on the issues that we will face as a community over the next year. I will do my best to serve the student body with diligence and honor.

**Candidate: Paul Messick**<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1885" title="Paul Messick" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paulie_m-300x200.jpeg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" />**
  
Position: Vice President**

****In the run-up to this election, many people have asked me &#8220;what the fuck does the Vice President actually do?&#8221; If you are asking yourself that question right now, I don&#8217;t blame you. Many of the formal duties assigned to the VP (as outlined in the senate bylaws available on SIN) are extremely arcane. They include presenting a budget &#8220;outlining the expected payroll and administrative expenses the Senate will incur that semester&#8221; (Section 2 D ii), charing finance committee (Section 2 E ii), and overseeing the treasury (Section 6 C). As one of your treasurers for the past two semesters, I understand the way student body funds are allocated and distributed at Reed. I&#8217;ve worked to ensure your student body fees are well utilized, helped construct institutional memory within the treasury, and helped prevent _The Quest_ from being hounded by creditors. If elected, I would continue to refine the mundane aspects of the financial side of Senate by looking for ways to make it as easy as possible for you to request money for your badass project or club, get funded, and get disbursed.

**Candidate: Mirell Cohen<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/dscn1936-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1890"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1890" title="Mirell Cohen" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSCN19361-300x241.jpeg?resize=300%2C241" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Position: Senator**

Hi, I&#8217;m Mirell Cohen, a sophomore philosophy major. I&#8217;m a candidate for the senate. These are some initiatives I&#8217;d like to achieve to help improve student life here at Reed.

1. More wages for student body workers: Right now the amount of pay is simply not comparable to any real part time job. Broken down by hours, the stipends allotted to most student body workers are below minimum wage. These include such valued members of the community such as Honor council members and J-board members. By such low wages we are either forcing low income students to take another job to supplement their income or not get involved and work for the student body at all. I can&#8217;t see how this can be looked at as a good state of affairs.

2. End the vanity elections: Many reedies (myself included) are tired of having to sort between meaningful things to vote on (such as senatorial elections or constitutional amendments) and joke positions for which there is only one candidate and the position is some inside joke such as &#8220;dad of the year&#8221; to use an example from last year. If we wish to present ourselves as serious and committed to making the electoral process as simple as possible, these do not help us at all. In addition they really aren&#8217;t that funny.

3. Increase awareness about the senate and its role: I&#8217;d promote an article in the quest at the beginning of each semester laying out the roles of each position of student government. At the very least provide a link in the quest for those who want to know more. To find out the actual responsibilities of a senator, I had to go searching. Many students I&#8217;ve talked to still have no idea what the senate actually does. This situation is fairly easy to fix, and after all, an informed electorate is a good electorate!

4. Promote Diversity: Let&#8217;s face it, Reed is a very homogeneous place. Coming from a school that was less than half white people to Reed was quite an eye-opening experience, and not in a good way. As someone who believes heavily in the positive value of diversity, I don&#8217;t think that Reed is currently doing enough to encourage people of color to come to our school. I will attempt to promote diversity in any way I can.

5. Build Smoking Gazebos: Smokers should be able to smoke and also abide by the Oregon law that neccesitates them being 10 feet or more away from a building. Smoking gazebos solve the problem quite handily and I&#8217;m honestly surprised they haven&#8217;t been built yet.

My Qualifications: I have professional experience and firsthand knowledge regarding both the issues of drug use (I was the intern at a drug rehab facility) and Sexual assault prevention and response (I&#8217;m currently working for Jyl Shaffer as a peer sex educator). Considering that the spring crisis last year regarded the former issue, and the latter issue has been ever present on college campuses since their inception, I believe these experiences can and will be relevant.

Endorsements: I have been endorsed by Tamara Metz and Peter Steinberger, the two cutest Political Science professors!

**Candidate: Maya Frodeman<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/mayafrodeman/" rel="attachment wp-att-1881"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1881" title="Maya Frodeman" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mayafrodeman-191x300.jpg?resize=191%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Position: Senator**

Hello friends at Reed! For those of you who already know me, you have an idea of the energy that I will bring to senate. But for those of you for whom I&#8217;m simply ‘that girl who you have seen around but don’t know her name’ this paragraph is a shout out to you! Like you, I am crazed—especially since it is the end of the semester. I want to bring that crazed Reed energy into Senate discussions to highlight issues often hidden. Some claim that old Reed is dead. But when I look into the history of Reed, I see a periodic rebirth of the Reed spirit. The fact that there still is a senate is proof of this. We still have the foundation of the Socratic education that all of us Reedies seek; however this could easily disappear. There needs to be an active voice in the student government that will focus on reiterating the ideals and morals of this old Reed spirit. On Senate I will be the voice of this older spirit. I will challenge the norms that are now established and work to secure an image of Reed that you will be proud of.

Candidate: Ben Goggin
  
Position: Senator**

HELLO CONSTITUENTS OF REEEEEED. I’m a Junior Political Science major (ex-Bio Major) running for Senate. Here are some reasons why you should vote for me:

  * I’m good at navigating bureaucracy/administrative bodies and getting stuff done – I created, got funding for, and organized the absentee voting drive on-campus in less than two months.
  * I’m real yo’ – I love talking to Reed Students and listening to everyone’s viewpoint, and I’m still willing to fight for what is right. Earlier this semester I kept it righteous when I advocated for and secured freedom from censorship of FB events by the administration.
  * I have experience with Student Government &#8211; I was on a committee my freshman year, have had many dealings with the treasurers/senate through my student organization, and talk regularly with members of the SB government. Also high school, lol.
  * I love my people (that’s you) – I’m a Karma Patrol alum and Night Owl.

Ideas for the future:

  * Increase access to Senate and Student Government through the INTERWEBZ, creating a more democratic Senate.
  * Maintain autonomy of the Student Body in the face of increasing numbers of administrators and bureaucrats.

Hit me up if you have questions/love letters: MS 497, [&#x62;&#x67;&#x6f;&#x67;&#x67;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][3].

**Candidate:** **Justin Haddock<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/justinbig/" rel="attachment wp-att-1883"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1883" title="Justin Haddock" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/justinbig-300x225.jpeg?resize=300%2C225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>**
  
**Position: Senator**

Reed is an important place. We are privileged to attend a school that still harbors the fading dream of a liberal arts education. We benefit from a community in which artists, scientists and academics of every description rub shoulders. We receive both breadth and depth. Diverse experience and a disparate set of skill make up the foundation of the adaptable mind.

And yet apathy spreads like a plague across the campus, threatening to to destroy the vision that students here have held for over a century. We willingly trade chaos for comfort. Depth for ease. Passion for peace of mind. Great things die by degrees, and Reed is no exception.

As a Reed senator I hope to protect the Reed that students know and to move towards the Reed that students want. I will do my utmost to navigate contentious issues without cutting away at the things that define Reed. Together, we can drive back the gathering dark.

**Candidate: Mat Olson<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/mat/" rel="attachment wp-att-1884"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1884" title="Mat Olson" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mat-200x300.jpeg?resize=200%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>**
  
**Position: Senator**

Senate needs people. People who will take time out of their busy schedules to address everything Reed can throw at them. I propose two ways to fulfill this need: 1. We create an automaton that can do it for us. It’d be quick to answer emails, show up to meetings, and participate in discussions. The robot would have to be capable of intelligently examining budgets during Funding Hell—something I’m sure we can write an algorithm for. Something harder: it’d have to be able to work cooperatively with others to come up with responses to the turmoil that sometimes upsets student life. The robot would need to be a good communicator and an especially good listener, as Senate cannot function to the benefit of Reed if it can’t listen to and engage with students, faculty, the administration, and itself. How could we imbue such an automaton with a vision of the school that it would work to refine, defend, and support with zeal? Option 2. We elect me or any other student to the position of Senator. I care about this place a hell of a lot more than a robot would, and I’d work twice as hard as one.

**Candidate: Andrew Watson<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/senator-photo/" rel="attachment wp-att-1886"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1886" title="Andrew Watson" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Senator-photo-224x300.jpeg?resize=224%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Position: Senator**

Every week when I read the CSO Blotter in _The Quest_, I see another Reedie’s bike stolen. When I talk to students about what they’re concerned about on campus, they tell me that they wish someone would address the epidemic of bike theft. I brought my concerns to Senate and was met with the obstacle of bureaucracy preventing the change we need: accessible, secure bike storage on campus.

I want to be your Senator because I want to bring about the changes you ask for. I will fight to implement changes that the student body demands, and I will not give up when I am faced with opposition from the bureaucracy or otherwise.

What’s most important to me is not making Reed the place I want it to be, but making it the place we all want it to be. My starting point is with the issue of bike theft, but I believe that Reedies will feel comfortable approaching me with the issues that matter the most to them. And that is what I stand for: meaningful changes that matter to you.

Candidate: August Wissmath<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/12/meet-your-candidates/augustw/" rel="attachment wp-att-1892"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1892" title="August Wissmath" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/augustw-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>
  
Position: Senator**

August Wissmath is a Reed Sophomore running for the position of Senator. His previous experience in political arenas include active high school involvement in policy debate and moot court, which both simulate settings of legitimate political and legal discourse.

August is passionate about Reed’s tradition of student autonomy and initiative, and would describe student autonomy at Reed as the “mitochondria” of the cultural organism that is Reed College. In particular, August envisions senate that can revitalize student initiative, and serve as a more authentic mediator between student and administration disputes.

He describes his basic platform in three basic points:

First, on the level of the everyday lives of the student body I&#8217;m making it my top priority to open up serious and accessible discussions about student stress cultures.

Second, on the level of bureaucratic policy, I get the sense that senate needs a more effective process of oversight, when handling, distributing and managing your money in student body funds.

Lastly, I want to make senate not only feel but become an effective institution, which stands for student initiative and autonomy and campus. Lately, Administrative procedures seem to be restricting student run projects, and it almost seems as if student autonomy might disappear into the mythic past, which we call &#8220;Olde Reed.&#8221; My vision for both senate and the student body is a renaissance of student initiative. That means more student run projects, more efficacy towards bad ass student groups like Weapons of Mass Distraction or Defenders of the Universe, and more senate support for Reed traditions like Paideia.

Position: _Quest _Board**

We&#8217;ve been your Queditors this fall. We&#8217;ve brought you coverage of campus conversations about** **graffiti, smoking, bike theft, and other controversies, and even pictures of kittens. Our mid-semester move to rolling online publication made the information you wanted available the moment we were ready to report it; no more waiting for Friday mornings to read Monday&#8217;s news. Our strong online presence has made _The Quest_ available to as wide an audience as ever—more students are engaged, and alumni from around the world are tuning in to keep up with their alma mater.

All the while, we&#8217;ve been working with the next generation of Queditors—our writers—who have dedicated their time and effort to becoming a troop of high-caliber reporters. They&#8217;re already helping us design layout, manage our social media, and wrangle advertisers. This injection of new blood not only keeps _The Quest_ fresh and ensures quality reporting, it also guarantees that the editorial board that succeeds us will not be a failure.

For the first time in recent memory, individual issues of _The Quest _have actually generated profits on advertising—all without sacrificing the coverage the student body wants and needs—which means more Student Body Funds are available for student groups to bring in bands or bake pies. This, in combination with our plan for succession, our experience, and our dedication, leaves _The Quest _with a solid foundation as it enters its hundredth year of existence.
