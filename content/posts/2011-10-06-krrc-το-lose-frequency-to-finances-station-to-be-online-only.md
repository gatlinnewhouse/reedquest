According to Alexa Ross, signator for KRRC, Reed’s student-run radio station will transition from terrestrial broadcasting to online-only because of lack of funds to maintain equipment and keep the station’s frequency, 97.9 FM. Two years ago, the station nearly lost its frequency to the interests of commercial station KNRQ-FM.

Ross identified rising legal costs, day-to-day maintenance of station equipment, and lack of student funds as contributing factors to the station’s decision to move permanently to an online-only format. The funds that KRRC draws from the student body are insufficient to update its aging broadcasting equipment and to continue paying its lawyers to ensure that the station complies with FCC regulations. “Because of the license we have, we would have to pay a lot of money to stay terrestrial, and the college isn’t able to afford that,” said Ross.

Currently, Ross is looking to make a senate proposal to move the station entirely online, arguing that this will protect the station from FCC fines and cut out large chunks of dead space in programming schedules. According to Ross, Kristen Holmberg, director of student activities, noted that Reed alumni might not respond well to an online KRRC. However, Ross points out that “going online is, honestly, better for the station because it will save us money and time, and will keep us from having dead space at 3 in the morning.” Both agree that KRRC must make the transition, though. Ms. Holmberg says “It would in fact be easier and cheaper because the FCC wouldn’t be involved.”

KRRC nearly lost its frequency two years ago to KNRQ-FM, a commercial station based in Aloha, OR. “Those above us on the ‘ladder’ of licenses can bump people below them,” said Holmberg. The station’s educational license makes it possible for larger stations to take its frequency if they wish. In the end, though, the station did not acquire the frequency. Ms. Ross suspects that this was due to finances.

Since the Reed Radio Club first began broadcasting at 660 KRCB-AM in October 1955, Reed College students have been on and off the air for a number of reasons related to limitations of both equipment and licensing. However, in the last decade of KRRC’s existence, the station has had to deal with these obstacles as well as the fact that Portland’s airwaves have grown more crowded over the years. As recently as 2002, the station lost its previous frequency, 104.1 FM, to KFIS-FM, a Christian radio station from Tillamook.

Though KRRC currently boasts an eclectic mixture of rap, R&B, and rock among other things, Reed’s first station focused primarily on classical music, mixing in student news, poetry readings, panel discussions, jazz, and student-led variety shows. Throughout its 50-year history, the station has produced mainstays in both Reed culture and in national radio, such as Barry Hansen ’63, better known as Dr. Demento. Moreover, the station has had its small share of near-brushes with fame, such as the live, on-campus recording of the Kinks in 1968.
