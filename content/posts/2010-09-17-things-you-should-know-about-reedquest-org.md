Hey guys,

Given the level of controversy this site has inspired, I thought it might be good to make some clarifications.

1. If you submit an op-ed to the _Quest_, you have the right to choose whether or not your article is published publicly on the webpage. We want the _Quest_ to remain a safe space for students to write about personal issues/things they don&#8217;t want the whole world reading. A submission form should be up on the site within the next couple of days. When you submit your article, all you have to do is check the box indicating that you want it to be private, and it will not appear on the main page. Until we have the permission system set up, all op-eds will be made private by default.

2. Posts that are made private are only visible to registered users. How do you register? Click the link on the top of the page and sign up with your Reed email. The administrator will then check to make sure your Reed email is valid, and approve your membership. After this, you&#8217;ll have access to 100% of _Quest_ articles. Private articles do not show up on the main site, archive pages, or RSS feed.

3. What&#8217;s currently considered &#8216;sensitive&#8217;, and therefore private? The CSO blotter, as well as any op-eds designated for private posting. Hard news will remain public.

If you have problems with our system, suggestions for how to improve the site, etc. we would love to hear what you have to say. Comment here, or shoot an email to [&#x6c;&#x62;&#x75;&#x74;&#x63;&#x68;&#x65;&#x72;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1] or any of the other email addresses listed on the Contact page. The site is still in development (and just wait &#8212; we have some really nifty things in the works) so your help is appreciated!

**UPDATE:**

You can now easily submit articles, photos, corrections, suggestions, etc. through the form on our contact page. [Check it out!][2]
