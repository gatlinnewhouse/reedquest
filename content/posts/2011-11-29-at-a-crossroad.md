Last week, Reed community members interviewed candidates for the position of Assistant Dean of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.  The creation of this position is the primary administrative response to both internal and external pressures to change the way that Reed treats the idea of sexual assault.  In a larger sense, it represents a formalized decision by our school to deliberately shift our community norms regarding sexuality as a whole.  It is therefore highly significant that the two final candidates for this position bring to the table significantly disparate approaches to this deeply moral and increasingly politicized issue.

One increasingly popular and politically correct method of addressing sexual assault is quite straightforward.  It relies upon strict sets of adversarial procedures which label a “survivor” and a “perpetrator,” and its language places total responsibility for the events which lead to a report of sexual assault on the latter.  Such an approach projects a predatory nature onto respondents even before the process has begun; suspension and expulsion are mandated for the sake of deterrence .  Although a balanced judicial system should deploy severe sanctions in the case of proven and deliberate transgressions, the broad application of punishment regardless of case details not only is fundamentally unjust, but also undermines the concept of “consequences” in general.  This black-and-white approach also fails complainants by treating them as victims devoid of agency, regardless of the complainants’ desire (or lack thereof) to be labeled as such.  It is a one-size-fits-all approach to sexual assault, which bypasses critical thinking in the name of action.  Because it is adversarial and directed from without, it has a polarizing and divisive effect, forcing community members to choose sides.

Reed also has another option, which is less of a systemic method and more of an organic approach.  A lecturer defining “consent” to an audience of 200 isn’t effective, because consent and refusal take infinite forms.  However, grappling with the idea of consent and being okay with undefined yet communicable standards – that’s something I think our community can do.  The primary goal of this approach is therefore to encourage us to address these issues in a way that fosters thoughtful attention to sexual communication and expectations.  This type of dialogue ultimately serves to increase awareness from within, changing our sexual norms in an honest way.  When a case does move forward, it is administered in a non-adversarial way, with restorative justice in mind: the goal of the process is to re-integrate both complainant and respondent into the community in a healthy manner.

With its upcoming decision of candidate, our administration will reveal its decision to advance one of these approaches over the other.  Of the two presented above, I certainly hope that the latter is chosen.  Reed is a place of inquiry, and it is my fervent desire that we respond to the cry “sexual assault continues to occur!” not with witch hunts, but with thoughtful action driven by the following questions: How do we understand sexual assault, and how do we prevent it before it occurs?  When it does occur, how do we address it in a manner that both facilitates a return to health and also provides lessons for future prevention?  There may be no easy answers to these questions, but I have confidence that our unique community is well-equipped to wrestle with them – if we are given a dean who can guide us.
