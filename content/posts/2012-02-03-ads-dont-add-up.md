Comrades of The Quest,

Not many people like ads. Ads are the 30 second long annoyances that interrupt your Jersey Shore marathon, they are the pop-up ads that litter your computer screen, and they are the awkward Cialis commercials during the nightly news. Besides the multi-million dollar ads that run in the Superbowl or the occasional clever ad that goes viral on the web, there’s little incentive to pay attention to an ad. Why, then, do ads saturate virtually every facet of media? Well, because they make money. In the US alone, the sale of ads in 2010 generated (by conservative estimates) roughly 160 billion dollars. That money goes to support an ocean of businesses from massive media conglomerates like News Corp. to small campus newspapers like _The Quest_. Thanks to advertisers, _The Quest_ was able to recoup roughly 40% of its printing costs. However, not all is well in ad land.

_The Quest_ is what seems to be the exception to the rule when it comes to newspapers and ads. Traditionally, a newspaper will fund the entirety of its business with ad revenue or subscriptions or both. _The Quest_, however, is supported by Student Body Funds, which are allotted to us to cover our printing costs. _The Quest_ would be able to suspend all of its ad business and still be able to put out a paper each week thanks to the support from Student Body Funds. What then is the purpose of ads in _The Quest_? The answer is two-fold. One, _The Quest_ is able to repay its loan to the Student Body allowing other student groups a greater share of Student Body Funds. Two, _The Quest_ is able to operate under the guise of being a free and independent newspaper by limiting its dependence on Student Body funds.

_The Quest_ is divided. Do we continue in the ad business to help provide funds for the student body? Is that even our job? Are we willing to sacrifice our independence in order to avoid the ad business? One thing we all agree on is that ads in their current form do nothing but detract from _The Quest_. They provide no value to _The Quest_ or to our readers.

Some of our editors have suggested that _The Quest_ receive some portion of the ad revenue which would be earmarked for things like cameras, recording equipment, improving our website, adding color to a few pages of the print edition of _The Quest_, or other things that would ultimately enhance the quality of _The Quest_ and provide readers with a better experience. Additionally, this would give _The Quest_ an incentive to pursue advertisers. We would, however, be compromising on our independence by only paying a portion of the loan back to the student body.

Others have suggested that we increase our ad revenue so we can fully pay back our loan to Student Body Funds enabling us to be truly independent. Independence means that _Quest_ writers will be able to cover controversial issues without worrying about losing funding from Senate. Obviously this would require a significant increase in the amount of time put into our ad business and additional stress placed on the ad manager, which is already a demanding job.

And there is always the option of abandoning advertising altogether. Pursuing clients to advertise with _The Quest_ and securing payment for the ads they place is a time consuming job. Although technically the ad business is the ad manager’s responsibility, there is always some portion of the work that lands in the hands of the editors. Bowing out of the ad business would give _Quest_ editors more time to focus on creating better content. This would also give readers more time to critique the quality of our articles and less time to lament the large Pizza Hut ad on page four.

Once again we find ourselves looking to our readers to break the internal deadlock. Should we continue placing ads in _The Quest_ with the goal of repaying our loan from the student body? Should we abandon the ad business entirely? Or should we ask for a cut of our ad revenue to help improve our content?
