The Multicultural Resource Center (MRC) has allocated $2,000 for ‘New Voices’ grants. MRC interns Andrew Barney ’13 and Lily Garcia ’13 hope that the New Voices grants will empower students to develop their own projects relating to identity, diversity and social justice. As the name suggests, New Voices is designed to help students who may not have previously been involved in student projects realize their plans with the funding and the resources of the MRC, including assistance from the interns themselves.

According to Barney, any project from any Reed student is welcome. “The scope is really broad,” says Barney, emphasizing that the interns do not want to limit the creativity of projects. “There’s no one kind of student who can have conversations about culture, identity or oppression. This is something everyone should feel like they can do. [The projects] don’t have to necessarily be about ethnicity or ‘political.’ It could be some sort of study group, it could be an event, an artistic piece, a research piece, or an installation, just to give some examples. It could be anything!”

Garcia sees the projects as having a discursive purpose.  “If we can make every creation a public creation that attracts attention, it begins discussion,” adds Garcia. “It shifts what people are thinking about.”

Both interns feel that the MRC is under-utilized by Reed students, but feel like it can develop into a more useful resource “I think the MRC is still in the process of being defined,” says Garcia. “We don’t know what multiculturalism is, we don’t what its exact mission is. We want a lot of people to be a part of it as that comes together.”

There has long been a perception of low levels of involvement in diversity-related issues among the Reed student body compared to other colleges. “On a campus with more students involved in political activism and community service, people could just find like-minded students,” says Garcia. “At Reed, the infrastructure is primitive.”

The interns explain that there are a lot of resources available to student groups and to student groups affiliated with campus offices. As such, a lot of the efforts to explore social justice issues are contained within individual groups. There is no support structure for an individual student who might want to do a project without making a significant commitment, or without getting involved in a group. Garcia points out that institutional grants such as the McGill Lawrence Internship Awards are designed for students who have moved beyond the initial stages.

Applications are available in the library lobby, the student center and in Commons, and are due on November 21<sup>st</sup>. The interns hope that students will use the time between now and the deadline to mull over their ideas and formulate informed proposals. They hope to see a large number of applications, and are excited to help interested students develop an effective project.
