As part of last weekend’s grand opening of the new Performing Arts Building, Professor and Grierson Chair in Visual Culture at McGill University Amelia Jones gave a lecture on “Performance and Relationality.” Jones is seen as a revolutionary figure in the world of art history as well as an ardent feminist who has focused primarily on performance art. Jane Chin Davidson ’01 introduced Jones as someone who has continually redefined opinions of artists and how art history itself is studied.

“I’ve been in Portland once,” Jones began, “I thought it was just a few years ago, but when I dated it, it was 1983.” Her lecture topic spanned an even larger time period, as she began by talking about artist Chris Burden. His newer work is focused on bridges, but the early stage of his career was defined by daring performance art.

The man once known as the “Evel Knieval of the art world,” Jones explained, has taken to building bridges in the spirit of erector sets—building kits marketed towards boys. She saw this as a continuation of his persistent interest in gender-coded technologies, something that could be seen in his early performance pieces.

“In the early seventies,” Jones said, “[Burden] staged the male body to highlight contingency on others, demonstrating the social relationality of art.”

These bridges were between subject and object, Jones said, and function as a visual predicate similarly to his performance work in the early 1970s. The vulnerability exhibited by Burden’s work, when he had a group of students push him up a hill in a cement hamster wheel, or when he was shot in the arm by a friend, or when he touched and crossed two live wires to his chest, is now seen in these bridges. In some cases, if one innocuous supporting cylinder is moved, the entire bridge will come crashing down.

The vulnerability in his work is clear, but it’s not always clear who is vulnerable. In “Shoot,” for instance, he put himself in the line of fire by having a friend shoot him in the arm, but by putting himself in harm’s way, he was also in control. This conflation of subject and object extends to the viewers, who are equally disoriented by the arrangement and begin to question the relationships that define our identity.

Two other pieces discussed, “TV Hijack” and “Match Piece” begin with male violence. In both situations, males were put in an erotically charged and seemingly dominant situation. Yet, as Jones explained, “males are unable to assert their dominance” in both situations. In “Match Piece,” Burden, the male figure, wrapped aluminum foil around matches attached to a makeshift launching mechanism made of paperclips and lit the matches until the pressure created enough force to launch the little missiles across the room at a woman lying naked on the floor. (He interviewed many models for the piece, but his wife ended up having to step in after nobody else volunteered.)

The pace was agonizingly slow, with Burden preparing the matches individually in front of the audience at a pace of about one a minute. Yet, the match rocket, which Jones explained as representing sperm, rarely made contact with the girl and the performance ended up demonstrating a “misfire of male creative energy.” This created a “dialogical and asymmetrical relationality,” according to Jones, as “range and accuracy were impossible to control.”

Jones took a step back to say the bridges were “never-ending and never fixed” and called her powerpoint “an example of this continuation.” Burden is still best known for his early works, as they have become staged encounters that have stuck with him over time. Burden himself had also made a habit of incorporating the critical response to his work into pieces that explicitly demonstrated his relationship to those who viewed his art.

Creating a series of palimpsests, he would write his responses to critical interpretations directly on top of the magazine pages on which they were printed. “The dialogue he created with viewers over time,” said Jones, “was part of his meaning…. Reinterpreting his own quotations [in the pieces] to expose the lack of power and privilege.”

It was at this point I began questioning how my own involvement—in listening to Jones, experiencing Burden’s performance pieces on screen, and even writing this article—might be part of the art itself. My view was skewed by Jones’ unabashedly feminist point of view and that the presentation she was making was a catalog piece made for an upcoming exhibition of the artist’s work, as well as my own biases and forms of interpretation. Yet, these were equally unavoidable parts of my interpretative process and of the relational aspect of the work itself.

This was confirmed by the next section of Jones’s talk concerning the media and relationality, with technologies of representation mediating the acts and bodies. “Shoot,” for example, does not have relics, making first person accounts the only way of transmitting the information. Yet, once again, Burden interacted with viewers of his work in another piece titled ‘Show the Hole,” in which he individually showed people where the bullet from “Shoot” had entered and exited his arm.

His piece ‘TV Hijack” also displayed what Jones called the “second degree presence of representational media.” In this piece, he asked for a live studio transmission of an interview and then held a knife to a woman’s throat and threatened to take her life if they stopped the live transmission. The piece highlighted the televisual effects of violence as viewers could only see the action through closed circuit monitors.

The last part of Jones’ talk was titled “Vulnerable Relationality.” Burden’s use of his own body throughout the works blurred the lines between power and vulnerability, Jones explained, so that “the body is equally vulnerable to that which it seeks to alter.”

By using as his topics some of the most contested issues of his time, Jones explained, he “demonstrated how relationality interacted with social power in everyday life.” The durational aspect of his works, Jones went on, shows how they continue to be interpreted and viewed within new social contexts, and teaches us about how to restructure power.
