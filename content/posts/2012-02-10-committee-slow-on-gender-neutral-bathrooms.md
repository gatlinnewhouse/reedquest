Last week saw the opening of a new gender-neutral bathroom in the lower level of the GCC. Over a year after the passing of a student referendum that formalized student support for the inclusion of a gender neutral bathroom in every building on campus with a set of restrooms, Physical Plant has finally converted gendered bathrooms into non-gendered ones.

The road to equality has been a long one for those spearheading the gender-neutral bathrooms. Members of Blue Heron, a student group that works for social justice and radical social change, sparked discussion in October of 2010 with a confrontational opinion piece published in The Quest entitled “Gendered Bathrooms Make Blue Heron Pissed.” Their piece garnered a mostly negative response, as students felt unfairly labeled as bigots by Blue Heron. Following the unsuccessful opinion piece Blue Heron asked for help from Senate and was able to obtain support for gender-neutral bathrooms. A subsequent, decidedly more popular and less strongly worded opinion piece published in The Quest by Blue Heron vaulted the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms into the collective student conscience. With 20% of the student body in support of the gender-neutral bathrooms, the referendum was passed.

The referendum did not translate to immediate results. After the referendum was passed in the spring of 2011, the matter was passed onto the Physical Plant Committee, which is staffed by various faculty and staff as well as a single student. Physical Plant Committee is where the initiative began to stall. They considered proposals to add bathrooms in Vollum, the chemistry building and the lower GCC. Issues began to arise when the committee began to look at the science buildings for the placement of a new gender-neutral bathroom. Ellen Levkoy ’14, a member of Blue Heron who has been involved in the initiative to implement gender-neutral bathrooms, alleges that faculty and staff on the committee “traded it off, like they didn’t want it in their building.” Towny Angell, Director of Facilities Operations and a member of the Physical Plant Committee emphasized the importance of finding out if people that are using the bathrooms have a problem with a non-gender-specific bathroom. Dana Loutey ’12, the representative of Senate and only student on the Physical Plant Committee pointed out that “everyone’s wishes and comforts should be taken into account, not just the students.” Angell also defended the unease with which the faculty and staff on the Committee have approached the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms: “You have to get people educated to the concept first.” According to Levkoy, members of the Physical Plant Committee have held “backwards opinions that are offensive.”

In the wake of the upheaval in the distribution of space created by the new performing arts center, Physical Plant has treated gender-neutral bathrooms as a low-priority item.  Loutey confirmed that the primary focus of the Physical Plant Committee is currently the allocation of space in Prexy and theater building in preparation of the opening of the new performing arts building. Loutey added that Physical Plant Committee has only discussed the topic of implementing gender-neutral bathrooms for “about a half hour.” Loutey placed some of the blame for the lack of action on gender-neutral bathrooms on the Physical Plant Committee&#8217;s wish “to postpone making the change in order to see how well received the GCC gender-neutral bathrooms are.” According to Angell, there were no complaints prior to the implementation of the gender-neutral bathrooms in the lower GCC, although he has received complaints since their implementation. Angell declined to specify whether the complaints came from staff, faculty, or students.

Student involvement on campus has been a continuing issue for Reed as Senate and other student groups have been vying for the student body’s involvement, as covered in a December 3<sup>rd</sup> piece in _The Quest_ written by Kieran Hanrahan, “[Engagement in the Community? What Community? Senate, Students Fail to Cure Collective Apathy][1].” However, lack of student involvement seems to be the rule on the Physical Plant Committee. Loutey says she “often feels she does not have enough of a voice” on the Physical Plant Committee, although she attributes much of that feeling to being overwhelmed by “the passion with which staff and faculty members discuss space needs.”
