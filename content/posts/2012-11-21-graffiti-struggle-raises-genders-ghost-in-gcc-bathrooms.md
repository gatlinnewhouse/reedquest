With no easy solution to the ongoing struggle over graffiti in sight, students continue to mark up the walls in the lower-level GCC bathrooms. But between the two rooms, graffitiers&#8217; approaches vary widely.

In the left-hand room, which was a men&#8217;s room before the bathrooms were converted to gender-neutral status last year, the majority of the graffiti addresses the conflict directly. One message in large text reads, “The messages mean nothing; the conflict means nothing; we need some fucking resolution here. Let us PLEASE sort this out in a pragmatic + efficient manner, or not&#8230;”

Meanwhile, in the former women&#8217;s room, if the writers of graffiti are thinking about the conflict at all, they have chosen to address it in a different way. There, graffiti consists of drawings, philosophical musings, and the emotionally revelatory graffiti of the sort found in the restroom prior to its repainting last spring. Before graffiti began to be routinely erased, that was covered in colorful paint, Sharpied missives, and idle doodles, while the walls of the men’s room stayed relatively untouched and were periodically repainted. This year, students and Facilities Services have been going back and forth over the walls; Facilities says it is not its job to determine which graffiti is not acceptable, so all graffiti is painted over.

Though the rooms are now both gender neutral, use is still highly divided by gender, an informal _Quest_ study suggests. On a recent weekday lunchtime, of 22 people who used one of the two rooms, not a single person used the room that, before the conversion, did not correspond to their gender. “We&#8217;re used to it,” says junior Tess Lallemant. “And also it has more than one toilet.” (The former men&#8217;s room still has two urinals and one stall.)

The tone of the graffiti in the former men&#8217;s room is mixed. One piece of graffiti features a peace sign, a heart, and a dove, and the text “This is a positive reminder. Please do not erase.” Underneath it is written in another handwriting, “Seriously, you&#8217;re bad and you should feel bad if you paint over this.” In response to that, another graffitier wrote, “The people doing the painting have nothing to do with the decisions being made to do so” but the text was later crossed out. A third response said, “Doesn&#8217;t matter. They&#8217;re still dicks.”

Also in that bathroom, one student asked: “Reed = Creativity Facists? [_sic_] Re-painting = expensive and waistful as fuck! Bring back Olde Reed! ” Another wrote, “LoL, $500 to clean this. 10 seconds to write it again. Who wins here?” Both are apparent references to an estimate from Facilities Services Maintenance Manager Steve Yeadon that repainting the walls costs $200-$300, and repainting the stall dividers $1,000-$1,500. Yeadon says the money comes from the general maintenance accounts, which can be used for repairs as well as “special requests” like building new walls, cabinets, or bike racks.

The former women&#8217;s room, on the other hand, contained only a couple apparent references to the conflict at press time: “The images that exist on these surfaces do not affect the function of this bathroom,” and another, a drawing of an eye with the legend “This is a panopticon.” Much more prevalent are philosophical musings, like the graffitier who asked, “Is it possible for intelligence to coincide with happiness?” (One answer: “Leibniz was pretty chipper.”) Another asked, “Hey do you think you&#8217;ll be sad when you&#8217;re 80 and never decided that things are beautiful?”

One graffitier rewrote a line from the poem “We Were Emergencies” by the slam poet Buddy Wakefield: “But I have seen nearly every city from a rooftop without jumping.” Another wrote a verse that seems to be all her own: “Sixteen hours have passed/since last I was conscious/let&#8217;s make this short.”

Finally, the room would not be complete without the invocation to “Tell me your secrets.” Some responses were specific and private. Another said simply, “I want to **live**.”
