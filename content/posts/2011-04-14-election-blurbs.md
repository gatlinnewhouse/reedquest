**Senate Candidates (4 seats)**

&nbsp;

**Sarah Carlisle &#8211; 8 senate meetings**

Yo. I’m Sarah and I’m running for reelection to Senate.

Here are four great reasons to reelect me:

1. I love being a Senator! I love working with my peers to make your life easier and this school better. This job means the world to me.
  
2. I am really fucking good at being a Senator. I’m Appointments Chair, on the AOD Policy Committee, and liaison to Honor Council and the Trustees. I work very hard in all of these positions to represent the wishes and concerns of the student body and will continue to do so if reelected.
  
3. I am an enthusiastic, amiable, and respectful individual. I am comfortable working with administrators and know my way around school policy quite well. With these skills, I am more than able to get shit done.
  
4. I LOVE YOU. I really do. I consider myself blessed to live in a community of brilliant and thoughtful individuals and I want to continue to do everything I can to represent you, make you happy, and better your life here at Reed.

Please reelect me, because I love this job, this school, and especially you.

**Incitatus (Francis Dieterle) &#8211; 0 senate meetings**

Friends, Reedies, countrymen,

Today we are faced with grave circumstances that threaten our integrity as a community. Rampant corruption in government, disavowal of honor, and the vitriol of sophists threatened Rome when Incitatus first became a Senator (under the reigns of Caligula). With his Roman expertise, Incitatus will build the necessary bridges to restore order and honor to our corrupt government. Citizen, you may be asking yourself, “What can Incitatus do for me?” Not all of us can stand through the brayings of the corrupt senatorial class. As such, Incitatus will bring benefits by the bale to the people themselves: a new aqueduct, the installation of a marble amphitheatre, the institution of gladitorial games to decide matters of policy, and the allocation of funds for conquest of Greater
  
Eastmoreland. Citizens, we ask you to stand behind Incitatus, but not too close (and within his field of vision). Incitatus has shown time and again that you can’t beat a dead horse.

**Allie Hemmings &#8211; 1 senate meeting**

I am a freshman, soon to be sophomore who would very much like to be your senator next year. Reed has been awesome to me, and I would like the opportunity to give back. I love talking to Reedies, meeting Reedies and generally socializing with them, and as a senator my door would always be open for complaints, comments and concerns (and I would most likely have cookies).

I’m from Houston, Texas (and own no horses, trucks, or guns). At Reed I have participated in Mock Trial, blues dancing, and various SEEDS activities. When I am not busy with classes and school, I like to bake, dance, sing (fairly badly) and randomly emote in Spanish.

Community is important to me, whether it is in the form of a city, family, friends or a school. As a senator I would like the chance to get further involved in the Reed Community and the opportunity to create a more cohesive campus with open communication about the issues that are bothering us through encouraging
  
more student participation in student governance. Thank you for reading this blurb and for your consideration. I respectfully ask you for your vote.

**Jr Rodriguez &#8211; 5 senate meetings**

Height: 170 cm. Weight: 12.5 stones. Type: American/Fire/Robot

Special Powers:

Honor Slap = The Honor Principle defines Reed and we need to create more productive modes of conversation between students and head honchos.

Bear Growl = Defending Pokémon (other senators) are now paralyzed. The student body should be better informed about controversial policy/ official statements: weapons policy and diversity statement. Also I think we should reignite the rivalry with neighboring colleges specifically Lewis and Clark. Shenanigans consisting of freshman and upperclassmen would surely create a ‘space’ for students to discuss the honor principle and other Reed traditions.

Bacon Bite = The proverbial ‘bacon’ is whatever the students want it to be.

Weakness: Chuck Norris beard punch.

“To walk the road of peace, sometimes we need to be ready to climb the mountain…of conflict”

**Dana Loutey &#8211; 4 senate meetings**

The Reed community is privileged to have an independent, inclusive student body government. Yet, we must recognize that this independence may only be preserved through the hard work of our elected representatives and student leaders. As a senator I will work with the community to find solutions to contentious issues, notably the concerns regarding smoking. I will encourage students to take full advantage of the resources available to us and will promote participation in our wonderful, diverse collection of student organizations. My experiences as a Renn Fayre czar and print shoppe signator have taught me a great deal about managing organizations, budgets, and, crucially, negotiating with the administration. More importantly, though, these experiences have given me valuable insights in working with all members of the community, but especially the students. Finally, I think it’s worth noting that, if nothing else, I will be a better senator than Schwartz.

_Due to submission deadline difficulties, senate candidates not pictured are Torra Spillane, who is recorded as having attended eight senate meetings this semester, and Allie Theriault, who is recorded as having attended zero.

**Quest Board Candidates**

&nbsp;

**Sara Post et al.** 

A print newspaper presents the opportunity to spread information and discourse more effectively than perhaps any other medium. Students at this college should feel proud of the Quest and inspired to contribute to it. I would like to broaden contributions to include a much greater diversity of students, faculty, and staff. To this end, I will compile an expanding list of students willing to frequently submit ideas from their experiences to be selected from and written about. My story: In 9th grade I wrote for my high school newspaper in a public school of 4,000. In 10th grade two friends and I began an underground newspaper to combat reader apathy and poor quality. It annoyed the newspaper so much that they made me opinion editor. We brought the writers from our independent project with us to write, and it was a good year for the journalism department. I became co-editor in chief the year after that. Reed doesn’t need another newspaper; it needs to take fuller advantage of the resources already in place. With energy and organization, we can make the newspaper a school-wide collaboration without losing integrity of a publication that delivers timely news.

**ConQuest** __

We, Katleyn Best, Alex Blum, Esther Fraser, John Iselin, Ryn Linthicum, Shabab Ahmed Mirza, Maha Pasha, Danny Sellers, Robert Shryock, Aaron Smith, Kiri Strack-Grose and Alex Walker are running as a mighty team of twelve. A larger Questboard will allow us to provide better coverage of all the amazing things Reedies do. We will make our reporting informative, thorough, and engaging, and will avoid reiterating commonly known information or stuffing our pages with filler material. At the same time, we will continue to foster dialogue on important issues by presenting opinions that are respectful, relevant, and representative of the Reed community, and avoid pointless flame wars while keeping the Quest a forum for community discussion. In addition, we will follow the current Quest in attempting to ‘Burst the Bubble’, ensuring that Reedies are well informed about the greater Portland community as well as the world. ConQuest promises consistency, copyediting and class!

Do It For the Children of Gaia &#8211; Dana Loutey

There are numerous issues about the kids today, and I believe they should be pushed to the forefront of discussion. For example, who are the kids, and what do they want? Where do they come from? Do they have names? Do they need names? For these reasons, things need to be done for the children of Gaia.
