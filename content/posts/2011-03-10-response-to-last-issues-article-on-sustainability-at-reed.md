I’ve heard stories about the seniors of 2011 and their impressive persistence in pushing sustainability onto an institution that is hesitant to use solar panels for fear of making too large a political statement.  It is a difficult job indeed. So far this year, no one has interrupted Colin Diver onstage to advocate for a sustainability coordinator.  However, this does not mean that “sustainability is dead” at Reed. I would suppose that as member of both Greenboard and Sustainability Committee and a major in the new Environmental Studies program, I’m in as good a position as anyone to inform the student body of what is being done so far this year, and what we hope to do in the near future.

So far this semester, Greenboard has hosted two events on campus in order to inform and excite the student body.  The first was an eco-justice organizing workshop led by Ryan Clover of Shaleshock Action Alliance.  The second was a teach-in on coal exports by the grassroots activist group Rising Tide.  This Sunday, Greenboard is going downtown to protest the exporting of coal as it is being supported by CitiBank and Bank of America. Also on the agenda for this semester: an environmental film series, setting up a composting system for the dorms, hosting “Power Struggle” once again, working more closely with Sustainability Committee in order to implement tangible changes, hosting more on-campus workshops and off-campus activism trips, and quite a few other possibilities and ideas that you can ask me or any other members of Greenboard about if you’re interested.

Sustainability committee did not receive further funding this semester because there is a substantial amount from the past few semesters that has not been used.  We have had only two requests for funding this semester, one that did not materialize because we were not able to fund it in its entirety, and the other is still tentative.  I would like to know exactly who is being criticized when Ethan Knudson points out that “many projects have been approved and funded but _just didn’t happen_.”  The proposals that we have had so far are those such as, “Hey, let’s get a green roof on the SU!” that end up _just not happening_ because they are not well thought-out or feasible.  One of the priorities of the committee this semester is to better inform the student body on some of the fundamental criteria of a realizable proposal.

Part of the difficulty comes from a wide lack of institutional memory. We find it important to begin to establish a relationship between the student body and administration that makes sustainability a mutual priority, and where the forum for this discussion is made more visible, and can continue to be so.

“Sustainability is dead” sounds all too familiar to those harkening backs of Ye’ Olde Reed. How is it productive to frame our current community as constantly lesser-than?  There are students and groups on campus that are committed to the ideals of sustainability, who are perhaps a bit more under the radar than Joel Batterman, but still not turning a blind eye to the implications of our resource use.  If you are one of those people or if you are curious to talk to one of those people, please do contact me, Jenny Calvert-Warren, Mathilde Mouw, Sam Smith, or any other Greenboard member. We meet on Wednesdays at 7:00 in the Infoshop.
