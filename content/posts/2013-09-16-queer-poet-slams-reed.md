“Hello my gender is ‘fuck you — mind your own business!’” Snaps and claps echo throughout Eliot Chapel as the words of slam poet Kit Yan reach the ears of the audience. Last Friday, the Reed campus was graced with the presence of the New York Times recognized, Asian American, transgender, queer, Brooklyn-based, Hawaiian slam poet for an event organized by the Multicultural Resource Center. Loving word play since he was five years old, Kit dealt with his transgender and queer struggles through the creation of his own verse; but it wasn’t until his sophomore year of college that he discovered his passion for slam poetry.

Instead of worrying about offending others who may find his views to be controversial or disturbing, Kit writes and performs his poetry fearlessly. In his first poem, “3<sup>rd</sup> Gender”, he did not hold back. Instead, he shouted “gender is America’s controlled nationalism bullshit” like he had years before when he performed the poem for the Department of Justice.

In addition to being a slam poet, Kit also writes songs. With the help of his ukulele, he sang songs about being in love, heartbreak, his family, and tortoise sex (yes, tortoise sex). His use of comedy, body movement emphasizing phrases, and realistic imagery contributed to the power of his verse. Instead of just a man saying poetry, he utilized the theatrical aspect of slam poetry to its fullest.

Following the performance, a few lucky lottery winners were able to attend a dinner where Kit continued to share aspects of his life and answer questions. Ignoring the fact that he really did not know anyone, he was not afraid to answer personal questions and no one was afraid to ask them.

Saturday morning in the new Performance Arts Building, Kit held a slam poetry workshop for those interested in writing their own pieces. He began the workshop by having participants write down a list of things that were on their minds, from which they chose a topic and simply wrote. After free writing, participants were challenged to read poetry aloud to a partner with the same daring openness as Kit. After writing three more drafts of poetry, everyone read aloud at normal speed, double speed, and half speed; then screamed them at the top of their lungs and whispered them into their partner’s ear. In the end, Kit brought out something in everyone and commended participants for the bravery of their poems.
