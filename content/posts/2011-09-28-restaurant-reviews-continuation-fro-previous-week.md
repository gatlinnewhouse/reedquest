Continued from last week&#8217;s edition, here are a few more Southeast-area restaurants for you to check out.

**Broder (2508 SE Clinton)**

I don&#8217;t know about you, but there was I time when I didn&#8217;t think of the Swedes ****as having a particularly noteworthy cuisine. That changed when I discovered Broder. ****From the decor to the ****smörgåsbords, there&#8217;s nothing not to like about this super-cute cafe on Clinton, which serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.****

For breakfast, try one of the bords—an assortment of bread, cheese, porridge, and other delectables served up on an adorable wooden tray**—**and wash it down with a mug of their delicious hot chocolate. At lunch, I like the Swedish meatballs or the låda lunch, an assortment of cheeses, cured meats, and breads. It&#8217;s often crowded, especially on weekends, but they offer seating and free coffee in the lounge next door while you wait.

By bike, head north on 28<sup>th</sup> until you reach Rhone. Turn left there, then right on 26<sup>th</sup>. Continue north on 26<sup>th</sup> until you reach Clinton. The restaurant is half a block down on the left.

By bus, go to Steele and hop on the 10 heading north. Get off at Clinton; the restaurant is half a block down on the left.

**Bete Lukas (2504 SE 50th)**

Ethiopian is another cuisine I had no knowledge of before coming to Portland. If you&#8217;re uncultured like me, let me demystify it. It consists of spicy meat stews, fragrant legumes, and a variety of vegetable preparations, all served on top of a flat, spongy sourdough bread called injera. And everything is to die for.

You could pick and choose individual items from the menu, but I typically order a meat combo and a veggie combo, served family-style. Vegetarians fare as well here as carnivores: the Yellow Split Peas and the spicy Eggplant Tibs are both excellent. Be sure to wash your hands; you won&#8217;t be using silverware.

By bike, go up Woodstock to Cesar Chavez. Turn left and head north to Division. Turn right and continue to 50<sup>th</sup>. Turn right and the restaurant will be on your left, on the second floor.

By bus, go to Cesar Chavez to take the 75 North. Get off at Division. Walk to 50<sup>th</sup>. The restaurant is half a block south of Division on the second floor of the building.
