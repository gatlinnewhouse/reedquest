The Badass Sparkle Princesses are known around campus for two things—being one of the most intense sports teams at Reed and eating babies. The women’s rugby club has been around since the 1980s and produced several Pacific Coast All-Stars, fice All-Americans and two Eagles (US National Team players).

This year, under our new coach Val Burns, the women’s team has improved exponentially. We’ve been practicing and playing with ORSU, Portland’s local women’s club (one of the top 8 in the nation), several of whose members are on the Eagles. Playing alongside some of the top talent in the country has helped both returning and new players excel at learning the game and provided valuable playing time. At a tournament a few Saturdays ago, the Reed women beat University of Washington (15-0), Central Washington (10-0) and Western Washington (24-5). Last Saturday, we lost 24-21 to the U of O Ducks, a D1 school.  The team put up a great fight, with Nora McConnell-Johnson scoring an epic try and Rachelle Johnson winning (Wo)man of the Match.

One of the best parts of our team is that about two-thirds of our players are freshmen! None of them knew how to play rugby before Reed, and they have all picked up the rules of the game quickly, demonstrating their bloodlust on the field. Additionally, they have all learned to love the rugby “traditions,” which include but are not limited to: shooting the (BB) gun at empty cans in the backyard of the Model Home, sock wrestling, waking up at the crack of dawn to travel to distant lands to play for 80 minutes, and learning to love glitter and unicorns.

Rugby is not just about demonstrating athletic prowess. The social aspect is just as important as dominating on the field. After every game, the two opposing teams get together to eat, drink, and sing wildly inappropriate songs, bonding over bruises and funny stories from the game. Fans are also always welcome at these socials, and all of you have opportunities coming up to get involved!

Come this Saturday at 11 am and watch us take on Central Washington University on our home pitch (field), located next to Naito! If you can’t make it this Saturday, you can also come the next weekend and see us play Western Oregon University.

Most importantly, we always welcome members of any skill level. Come join us at practice Tuesday and Thursday 5:30-7 on the rugby pitch, or email the captains, [Nora][2] or [Torra][3] for more information! Regardless of whether you join us in games or simply cheer us on from the sidelines, we would love to share our cheers and songs with you and **eat the babies**.

> One of the team’s pre-game cheers:
  
> God is dead,
  
> Nietzsche is mad,
  
> The world is ugly
  
> And the people are sad
  
> (repeat three times, screaming it on the last repetition)
