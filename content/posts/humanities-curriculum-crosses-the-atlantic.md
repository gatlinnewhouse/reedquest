In an email to the entire Reed community on Wednesday, January 31, Humanities 110 Chair Elizabeth Drumm announced that the faculty had reached a preliminary conclusion regarding the changed structure of a new Hum 110 curriculum. Starting in the fall of the 2018–2019 academic year, the syllabus will consist of four modules throughout the year with two in each semester. In the fall of 2018, the first two modules will consist of material from the current syllabus, and in the spring of 2019, the syllabus will include two new modules based in the Americas. In future years, the syllabus will include at least one module from the Ancient Mediterranean and at least one module from the Americas.

This structural change to the curriculum is a result of the decennial review process of the Humanities 110 curriculum that was accelerated in response to protest by members of Reedies Against Racism during the 2016–2017 academic year. The protests criticized the curriculum for perpetuating Eurocentrism, imperialism, and racism by centering the only required class at Reed in the worlds of Ancient Greece and Rome. Other criticisms included complaints about the high variability among conferences.

Decisions in the curriculum review process were primarily made by the Humanities faculty, although students and alumni were given the opportunity to share general opinions in the form of two surveys distributed in the spring of 2017. The results of this survey, according to Drumm, demonstrated overwhelming support for a unified, year-long, required course for first year students. The revision to the course retains these features, as well as the combined lecture and conference approach. Syllabus proposals were then discussed and voted on, leading to the selection of the modular design. 

Students currently enrolled in Hum 110 will have further opportunity to share their experiences and opinions in regard to the course when the external review board visits next week, on February 7 and 8. The external review board includes Roosevelt Montàs, Associate Dean and Director of the Center for the Core Curriculum at Columbia University; Karen Sullivan, Irma Brandeis Professor of Romance Literature and Culture and Director of Medieval Studies at Bard College; and Steven Swayne, Jacob H. Strauss 1922 Professor of Music at Dartmouth College. The program reviewers will meet with students and faculty from many departments on campus, and each Hum conference will appoint one current first year student to have lunch with the reviewers. Based on feedback and suggestions from the review board, the Humanities faculty will then design the syllabus for next year.

In a separate interview, Drumm expressed excitement for the possibilities this change provides for the future. “Looking ahead,” she said, “it will be easier to adapt and make changes depending on the interests of faculty members teaching in the course \[and\] to add a new module from time to time down the road.” In the more immediate future, the new syllabus is expected to be ready in April, when the faculty will hold informational sessions for the whole community.
