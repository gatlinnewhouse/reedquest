We talk a lot about where our food comes from and whether it is organic or fresh, but what about the question of who picked it? On Wednesday night, I was reminded that the apples and berries we buy and eat in Oregon are often picked by young children who have been pulled out of school in order to work as migrants around the U.S. Many of their families lack steady incomes and live in abominable housing circumstances. Can food be rightly considered sustainable by virtue of its being organic? Should we not be at least as concerned about the conditions and lives of the workers who picked it?

    Bon Appétit solicits student commentary on supporting farmworkers.

On Wednesday, Bon Appétit invited Ramon Ramirez and Javier Lara from Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste (PCUN), or Northwest Treeplanters and Farm workers United (est. 1985), to join Reedies in an on-campus viewing of _The Harvest,_ a film which documented the struggles of three kids who work alongside their families as migrant farm workers. Although the kids in the film live, inconsistently, around Michigan, Florida and Texas, Ramon and Javier informed us that the conditions for migrant workers in Oregon are among the worst in the country. Before Wednesday night I was unaware there is a camp for migrant workers only about 25 miles away from Reed. Our visitors form PCUN claimed that the conditions there would shock us.

My opportunity to watch the film and learn about these issues began when Bon Appétit&#8217;s Leo approached me as I got my lunch in Commons on Wednesday. He inquired, &#8220;You&#8217;re coming to the movie tonight, right?&#8221; Although at the time I didn&#8217;t know what movie Leo was talking about, I said yes, I was going, because he seemed enthusiastic about it. I quickly realized that the movie was related to Bon Appétit&#8217;s Farm Workers Awareness Week initiative. Leo gestured toward the huge sign, which had been hung in Commons to detail Bon Appétit&#8217;s dedication to Farm workers&#8217; rights and to educate students about how those rights are transgressed. Migrant Farm workers often work well below the minimum wage to do work so strenuous that the average life expectancy for them is 49 years. Just as astonishing is the fact the 300,000 migrant workers become poisoned by pesticides each year.

One of Bon Appétit&#8217;s recent efforts for farm worker rights has been what PCUN President Ramon Ramirez called a successful partnership between Bon Appétit and PCUN. PCUN describes itself as &#8220;Oregon&#8217;s union of farm workers, nursery, and reforestation workers, and Oregon&#8217;s largest Latino organization.&#8221; PCUN aims &#8220;to empower farm workers to understand and take action against systematic exploitation and all of its effects. To achieve this end, PCUN is involved in community and workplace organizing on many different levels.&#8221; On the national level, PCUN is currently working with OXFAM in order to establish a seal of approval that can be granted to and printed on food products in the U.S. whose workers have been insured safe conditions.

On a local level, using low-income loans, PCUN built houses in Woodburn, OR to provide migrant farm workers a safer and more livable housing option than the run-down migrant camps in which they might otherwise live. Having secure housing and the PCUN community nearby offering educational services and some career training has helped Oregon migrant farm workers to stay at home with economic security instead of following the crop, as it were, around the country. It is that traveling, as well as the economic instability it comes with, that forces children of migrant farm workers to leave school or to attend only parts of the school year. In Woodburn, OR, PCUN also has a radio station (95.9 FM), which the people who live in their housing can use to share their voices with the outer community. This, Javier said, is a model of community integration that empowers farm workers to share their own cultural values with the community they are becoming settled in instead of simply adopting the cultural values that the community already has. Javier informed us that the PCUN housing area includes many communities who speak indigenous languages other than Spanish. He said that they share their music on the FM radio station, and in this way the radio station offers cultural perspectives from outside of mainstream America or Mexico.

Ramon and Javier explained one of PCUN&#8217;s current projects, the building of the CAPACES Leadership Institute (CLI). PCUN&#8217;s website explains, &#8220;The Institute will build the leadership capacity and political consciousness to sustain and expand that movement and to propel a host of related struggles, such as immigrants’ rights.&#8221;

Javier pointed out that the efforts for migrant farm worker rights are multigenerational. In CLI, interested, inspired youth can become trained to participate in and carry on the movement. Working for migrant farm workers&#8217; rights requires strong organizational skills. The obstacles are many, as Javier and Ramon explained. PCUN often comes up against the interests of greedy corporations such as Monsanto, the notoriously inhumane top-producers of agricultural biotechnology in the U.S. During the movie event on Wednesday, Javier and Ramon encouraged Reedies to come volunteer in Woodburn with the building of the CLI, which should be completed by August. They also invited students to come on a tour to see the harsh reality of the migrant worker camp, as well as PCUN&#8217;s housing, and the CLI. Ramon told Leo that a tour should be organized during the next school semester. All six students present heartily agreed.

PCUN has a very accessible website that provides all of the information necessary in order to contact the staff and become involved as a volunteer. It also provides information with which to become acquainted with the complex issues surrounding farm workers&#8217; rights. People who suffer while harvesting the food that ends up on our dinner plates are close by, yet so far away from us. We must keep them in mind as we eat and perhaps even tune into the movement that aims to give them the wages and rights that they deserve.

PCUN can be visited [online][1].
