It’s Wednesday night. Cigarette smoke and the sound of snaps fill the air in the SU as students perched on thrift store couches and plastic folding chairs drink in the beer from their bottles and the syncopated rhythms of Reedies reading their poems. This is Dead Beat Reed Poets’ Poetry Night.

Founded at the start of spring semester last year by then-freshman Tristan Nieto, Poetry Night has become one of the best ways to experience the creativity of Reed students firsthand.

Nieto was first inspired to start a poetry night on campus while at home in Southern California during winter break last year.

“I went back to this coffee shop I used to hang out at that does a poetry night. I went to every one because I’d missed it so much. Then, it occurred to me that Reed College, host of the first reading of ‘Howl,’ has no poetry club or group that does readings. It was just an event that should have existed. I don’t know why people weren’t doing poetry readings already – fucking ‘Howl’ was recited here. We got mad Beat ties at this school; Gary Snyder and the all the rest of it,” said Nieto.

And thus, with a Facebook event invitation, a new arrangement of SU furniture, a jug of Carlo Rossi, and a sign-up sheet on lined notebook paper, Poetry Night was born.

From their humble beginnings, Poetry Night and the Dead Beat Reed Poets have grown immensely over the course of a semester.

“Poetry Night has evolved in all of the ways I think we wanted it to; the things that matter, like the passion and the madness that led Poetry Night from day one, are still with us. […] One can barely get a space on the sign-up sheet because so many people want to perform,” said junior Lizzy Martin, Nieto’s partner in all things Poetry Night. “There are some amazing, emotive, and intense deliverers who started off last semester as timid freshmen who we many a time had to encourage to speak louder. The performances have gotten much more personal and the Deadbeats interact with their audience much more. The writing itself has improved immensely as well; it’s not like we do critiques or any of that bullshit, either. When you’re a Deadbeat, you wanna sound good. You want everyone to yell at you and snap, clap, whoop, and howl.”

Sophomore and Poetry Night regular, Alanna Lynn contributes the event’s success to the dedication of Nieto and Martin as well as the caliber and variety of the performances.

“The experience of reading at Poetry Night is terrifying, yet gratifying. The Dead Beat community is incredibly supportive, and I’ve met some truly wonderful people. I doubt Poetry Night would be as successful as it is if not for the incredible dedication that Lizzy and Tristan provide. Our group as a whole is incredibly talented as well. We have a variety of performance types &#8211; not everyone reads poetry. Some people play music, some read short stories, and some just talk to us about life. At risk of using a clichéd phrase, there really is something for everyone; but, in the end, I think it’s the passion that keeps us here.”

When asked what’s in store for Poetry Night, Nieto said he hopes for a microphone and maybe coffee or a published collection of poems by the Deadbeats; Martin said, “Well, as for the future of Poetry Night, I’m making damn sure it sticks around. We have a pretty perfect system right now, so I doubt much will change with that.

“Poetry Night is successful because of our Deadbeats who came every Tuesday last year and showed up to our debut Wednesday Poetry Night this year, hands clapping, eyes wild, mouths free. People just let it all go when they come to Poetry Night because they know that the people watching are going to do the same thing and that Poetry Night is a place where anyone can perform. We don’t care who you are. If you have something to say, you are welcome.”
