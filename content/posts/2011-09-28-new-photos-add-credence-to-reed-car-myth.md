There might be a car buried under Hauser Library after all. Thanks to a batch of rediscovered photos taken in 1988 and a series of interviews with participants by Chris Lydgate, editor for Reed Magazine, the myth about the car buried under the library now has more credence than most other Reed myths, such as the one about the test monkeys under the Psych building.

The photos, courtesy of J.J. Valt and available on the Reed Magazine site, show students with shovels, pickaxes marking out the burial spot, posing above the half-buried car, flattening the convertible hood, and covering the car over with earth. Though it is difficult to get a sense of the vehicle’s location based on the photos, the first photo looks like it was taken to the right of the new entrance and in front of what is today the Cooley Gallery loading dock. Construction for the current entrance ended in 1989.

Even in light of the photos, doubts about the myth still persist. Towny Angell, the facilities operations director, is skeptical that a few people with shovels and pickaxes could have dug a hole so deep overnight and refilled it before daylight. Some maintain that the car is, in fact, not buried near the library. However, the participants stand by their story.

According to those interviewed, the vehicle, a green MG Midget, belonged to classics major Mark Verna ’87. Verna moved to Alaska after graduation, and his car spent a year hopping from house to house before some students decided to bury it in the construction area on the Northeast side of the library. The students, flattened the roof, popped the tires, and successfully buried the car not long after dawn.

The college constructed the original Hauser Memorial Library, what is now the reference room, in 1930. Its original entrance is the fire exit that looks East onto the front lawn. The current library entrance and the new addition were completed in 1989. In 2002, the college added a four-story renovation onto the Southeast corner of the library. The addition created 60 per cent more shelf space and provided for more offices and classrooms. There are over 500,000 volumes in the library, and 15,000 are added each year, not to mention the collection of government documents, manuscripts, rare-books collections, and the archival collection housed in the basement.
