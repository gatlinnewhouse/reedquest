Air traffic controllers across the nation are getting busted for sleeping on the job, but that’s not the only transgression those guys who are supposed to be keeping an eye on the sky have committed lately: just this Tuesday, an air traffic controller in Ohio was discovered watching a movie, Cleaner, while he was supposed to be on duty. How was he caught? Audio from the movie was transmitted for over three minutes via the controller’s microphone to all the planes in the airspace the controller was supposed to be monitoring. Somebody couldn’t wait to get home to get his Samuel L. Jackson fix.

If Donald Trump has only hinted at running for presidential office for the boost in ratings it would garner, his plan is working. Ratings for his hit show “Celebrity Apprentice” have gone up as much as 20% this season, with viewership nearly doubling from last season to a whopping 8 million viewers per episode. Trump is expected to announce his decision as to whether or not he will be running as a Republican candidate on the May 22 season finale, but he has already been pushed into the lead in recent polls of GOP primary candidates. Can you imagine…?

Obama is putting immigration reform on the table again. Meeting with a group of about 70 administrative officials and stakeholders on Tuesday, the President stressed the importance of reviving talks of immigration reform. As the 2012 presidential campaign begins to pick up speed, immigration reform continues to be a central issue that people on both ends of the political spectrum are expressing interest and concern in. Even the Governator – er, Schwarzenegger – noted in an interview with Jay Leno that the immigration issue is a “huge mess.” My suggestion? Schwarzenegger takes over as a one-man border patrol, keeping out the G.I.R.L.I.E. Men and letting only cool people and (good!) cyborgs in.

The CIA made available this Tuesday six recently declassified secret documents on their website that showed state-of-the-art spying techniques from World War I. The documents included instructions for writing in invisible ink and opening sealed letters without detection. I bet it’s a whole lot more complex than what I used to do as a kid: write in milk and have the recipient blast a blowdryer on the paper until the words appeared. It was from a Mary-Kate and Ashley book I got in fourth grade, okay? P.S: it’s really stinky. Don’t try it.

Google Maps has gone the route of Wikipedia! Google Map Maker, a tool that Google’s already been using in 183 countries and regions worldwide where maps weren’t that great to begin with, allows users to contribute changes for areas they know and have them incorporated into the map pending approval by other users. Only potential drawback: pranksters who get kicks out of sending hapless travelers to remote wastelands.

The Happy Meal is under attack! Public health officials, parents, and lawmakers have long complained that the lure of toys offered with the fast-food package aimed towards children have contributed to the rise in childhood obesity, but one Sacramento mother of two took it a step further when she sued McDonald’s. A rep for the mother said in a statement that the biggest problem McDonald’s presents is its constant advertisements that go around parents and directly to children. Most food companies don’t advertise so directly, though there is nothing legally prohibiting corporations from doing so. It’s nice that she’s looking out for her kiddos, but if her car gets egged by furious five-year-olds, don’t say she wasn’t warned.

Monday evening a 14-year-old boy was shot and critically injured in a shooting near Lloyd Center Mall. Shiloh Hampton, the victim, is a freshman student at Madison High School. After leaving the mall with a group of friends around 5 PM, someone fired a series of shots into the crowd at the corner of Multnomah and NE 11th Avenue – two of which hit Hampton and left him with life-threatening injuries in the intensive care unit. Said a friend in an interview, “No, he wasn’t a gang member. He wore red, but even wear the wrong color out these days and you don’t even stand a chance.” Guys, this is really tragic. What the fuck.

Tuesday morning a woman was arrested for reportedly spitting on a TriMet driver. The 27-year-old perp, Mistyblue Alaminia Carr, refused to pay her fare on the 71 bus and then proceeded to spit on the driver, hitting her eyes and mouth. The incident was caught on security camera. Let me tell you something, Mistyblue – back home, this would have gone down very differently. Crossing an MTA employee is like signing your own death wish. You’re lucky you pulled this stunt in friendly PDX; a New York driver would have left your ass on the pavement outside with a black eye and sans your front teeth.

Portland Police busted a meth lab inside a NE PDX home, complete with weapons on the premises, thanks to neighbors reporting unusual activity to law enforcement officials. I’m guessing Attorney General John Kroeger is patting himself on the back for this one. Remember when he said “If you sell drugs in Oregon, we are coming after you”? This is his dream. Civilians actively partaking in Operation Frogger? Holy Foucault, Batman!
