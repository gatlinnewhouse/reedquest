Senate will begin accepting submissions to the Funding Poll this Thursday, January 26 at 5:00pm. The submission process will close the following Sunday, January 29 at 5:00pm. In order to register your organization for the Funding Poll, you must first become a signator by attending signator&#8217;s training on January 25 or 26 at 4:00pm in Vollum Lounge. You must attend one of these trainings even if you have previously been a signator. You must then register your organization in the SIN organization manager at <sin.reed.edu/webapps/organizations>. Finally, you must register your organization for the Funding Poll at [<http://sin.reed.edu/webapps/fundingpoll/>][1]{.broken_link}.

Funding Poll will open for voting on Monday, January 30 at 12:00am and close on Wednesday, February 1 at 11:59pm. As per the Senate Bylaws, &#8220;each current student shall be allowed to vote an approval or disapproval of any of the submitted organizations. Each student may also abstain from voting on any number of organizations. An approval vote for an organization shall raise the vote total of that organization by as much as two disapproval votes would lower the vote total of that organization. Each student shall also have the option of marking up to six approval votes as approval supervotes (Top Six) or six disapproval votes as disapproval supervotes (Deep Six) or any combination thereof totaling no more than six supervotes. An approval supervote shall be counted as four (4) approval votes. A disapproval supervote shall be counted as four (4) disapproval votes.&#8221; The Senate Bylaws can be found at <shttp://sin.reed.edu/senate/SenateBylaws>.

The Top 40 highest ranking organizations will be announced on Thursday, February 2. Their time slots for Funding Circus will be announced shortly thereafter.

Top 40 budgets are due by Friday, February 3 at 5:00pm. Because of the fast turn around time between this due date and the announcement of the Top 40 organizations, we recommend that the signators of large or popular organizations begin composing their budgets now.

Funding Circus will begin at 9:00am on Saturday, February 4 in Eliot 216. Funding Hell will begin at 9:00am on Sunday, February 5.
