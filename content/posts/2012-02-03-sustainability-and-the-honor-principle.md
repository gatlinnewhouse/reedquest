In the 80’s during apartheid, students occupied Eliot Hall and brought classes to a halt after the Board of Trustees refused to divest in South Africa. The Board held that Reed made good money from its investments in South Africa, but they ultimately relented. We face a similar situation today with Reed’s attitude toward sustainability. The Board of Trustees is willing to make environmentally sustainable decisions as long as they are also financially sustainable.

The new performing arts building will have solar panels and a green roof largely because including these features will save money in the long run. During the design process of the building, a geothermal heating system was considered, but decided to be too expensive to realistically implement. While solar panels may be more financially feasible than a geothermal system, solar panels generate comparatively little energy and make only a small dent on a building’s carbon footprint.

Any economics major knows that many actions we perform, many goods and services we provide, carry hidden costs called externalities. A gallon of gas may cost you x dollars, but that price doesn’t include the cost of detrimental environmental effects that burning the fuel causes. It may cost Reed more money to minimize its footprint, in fact, Reed may even lose money in doing so, but we don’t include the externalities associated with not taking action in those costs. We don’t factor in the Pacific Island nations that are losing their native sources of potable water and then disappearing into the ocean, nor the species that are going extinct as climate patterns change and acid rains intensify, nor the billions of people that will be at risk as their glacial sources of freshwater disappear.

Last year, Greenboard tried to hold a contest between dorms to reduce electricity usage, but so few people even knew it was occurring that it was described to me as a failure. Part of this failure was probably a result of poor publicity–_The Quest_ would be more than happy to publicize any such event in the future–but I imagine it was mostly a result of Reedies’ being busy. I understand. Nonetheless, at the end of each Hum Lecture, I see students throw recyclable material into a small trashcan inside Vollum Lecture Hall, though recycling bins are just outside the door. “I’m busy” isn’t always a valid excuse.

That brings me to my main point: Being sustainable is being honorable. As we consider honor in making our decisions as individuals, we consider the consequences of our actions on our peers. If we pollute our planet with greenhouse gases or waste that will never biodegrade, we are dishonorably affecting the lives of our fellow beings, current and future. Just as Reed’s investments in South Africa promoted a racist regime, Reed’s decision to make environmentally sustainable decisions only when it is financially convenient promotes an obsolete form of capitalism that doesn’t properly address the needs of humanity or the ecological health of the Earth.

Reed does do many things right, and you can look them up at: <http://www.reed.edu/sustainability/sustainable_practices.html>{.broken_link}. The Grove is LEED Silver certified, Commons [composts][1], Phys Plant makes mindful decisions and is actively working to reduce our carbon footprint, the Canyon is an ecological gem, and so on.

But until the Board of Trustees is willing to factor the costs of environmental degradation into its decisions and be sustainable ahead of the financial curve, Reed is not being as honorable as it should.
