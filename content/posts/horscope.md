**Aries (March 21–April 19)**

I don’t know about your grades, but this semester will certainly do great things for your love life. Definitely find the courage to ask out your crush. If they say no, ask out your other crush. 

**Taurus (April 20–May 20)**

You should just quit while you are ahead. To be frank, things are only going to get worse. You have managed to keep your facade of responsibility so far this semester, but we all know that starts to disappear around week three. 

**Gemini (May 21–June 20)**

Stay away from knives this semester. 

**Cancer (June 21–July 22)**

Stay away from Geminis this semester (see above).

 

**Leo (July 23–August 22)**

Your GPA is forecasted to rise this semester. Just kidding! Mars waning in your celestial house does not bode well for your grades. Head to the library and save yourself before it is too late. 

**Virgo (August 23–September 22)**

Because Venus is rising in your celestial house this semester, this would be a great time to drop out and found Apple. 

**Libra (September 23–October 22)**

Your grades this semester will solely rely on how well you kiss up to your professors. You should take all of them out for a spa day. Consider it wellness for your GPA. 

**Scorpio (October 23–November 21)**

Love is not in your favor this semester; not because of the stars, but because of who you are as a person. Gross. 

**Sagittarius (November 22–December 21)**

You had a problem set due twenty minutes ago. Don’t worry! Your professor does not accept late work, so you don’t have to worry about finishing it anymore.  

**Capricorn (December 22–January 19)**

Beware of the canyon that beckons you. The nutria will have their vengeance. 

**Aquarius (January 20–February 18)**

The presence of the constellation Orion in your celestial house forecasts that you will a join a club this semester, but neglect to go to any of its meetings. Maybe try getting a job instead?

**Pisces (February 19–March 20)**

It is unlikely, but the stars foretell that you will have a lot of homework this semester.
