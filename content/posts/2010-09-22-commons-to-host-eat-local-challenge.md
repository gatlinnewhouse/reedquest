The countdown for Bon Appétit Management Company’s sixth annual Eat Local Challenge begins!

On Tuesday, September 28th, every Bon Appétit café across the country will feature a special meal prepared completely from ingredients from within a 150 mile radius of the café, the only exception being salt!

In addition to a delicious, seasonal dish that highlights Portland’s local bounty, the Eat Local Challenge is an exciting educational opportunity for the Reed community.  We aim to raise awareness about the issues facing our local food supply and educate our guests about simple, delicious ways to preserve our agricultural heritage.

An information table will be stocked with educational materials from Bon Appétit and other organizations that are trying to protect our local food supply.

Highlights will include: a Farm to Fork map featuring all of the small farms we support across the country and an Eat Local Challenge quiz for guests to test their “local food knowledge” and have a chance to win an iPad.

For more information, contact [Daxton King][1]. Otherwise, see you at lunch!
