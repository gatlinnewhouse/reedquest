Dogs are not an uncommon sight around Reed. However, when an orderly stampede of canines of all shapes and sizes goes marching around ODB, heads are sure to turn. This Saturday at the Centennial Celebration on the south side of the Old Dorm Block there was a pet parade. It was the first of the year and a follow-up to the parade at Renn Fayre the year before.

Though the parade advertised itself as a &#8216;pet&#8217; parade it was really more of a dog parade, as few other animals were represented. This may have been disappointing to anyone who was holding out for a cat or ferret or liger—just anything different. Luckily, despite the lack of variety in the species of pets, there was a remarkable amount of creativity and diversity among the dogs. There were all sorts of dogs: Some were rowdy, some were big, some were hairy and some were not. Others yet were in all sorts of costumes, from a simple bandana around the neck to a full-on fairy costume, worn by the dog that won “Most Creative.”

Other titles included: &#8220;Best Overall,&#8221; for both large and small dogs, &#8220;Best Character,&#8221; for which two dogs tied, &#8220;Cutest,&#8221; which a fittingly cute border collie won, and &#8220;Best Walk,&#8221; arguably the most important title of the parade.

&#8220;Best Walk&#8221; recognized the dog that &#8216;paraded&#8217; the best by being the most pleasing and entertaining to watch. The title was won by Kuma, a returning champion who won the last parade at Renn Fayre, and whose name means &#8220;bear&#8221; in Japanese. Catie, Kuma&#8217;s owner, said, &#8220;I felt surprised to win because there were so many cute dogs.&#8221; She was definitely right about that.

However, between the other dogs who weren&#8217;t listening to their owners, who were a little too calm for a parade, and who defecated on the lawn during the parade, it&#8217;s really not hard to understand why Kuma won. He not only was energetic and friendly, but knows a range of tricks like roll over, play dead, and—most impressively—showing off his hops!

All in all, the pet parade was a success, despite the general uniformity of the type of pets. It was a great way to celebrate Reed&#8217;s septuacentennial—if you&#8217;re counting in dog years.
