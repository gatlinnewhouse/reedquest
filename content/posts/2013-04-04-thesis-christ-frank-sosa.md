Eight years ago, scientists at Yale University tested seven capuchin monkeys to see whether they deviated from a basic economic theory: that, when faced with an economic choice, humans (or, in this case, primates) will act rationally. Unsurprisingly, they did. But the important finding from the study was that the capuchin monkeys deviated from the theory of rationality in the exact same way that humans do.

In humans, such a deviation from rational behavior is called “loss aversion.”

At its most basic level, loss aversion posits that the way in which you describe or frame a choice can affect people’s decisions. For his thesis, psychology major Frank Sosa ’13 of Los Angeles hopes to find out whether pigeons demonstrate loss aversion as well. Frank provides an example of loss aversion: dieting people who go to a grocery store to buy meat are more likely to buy meat labeled as “95% lean” than meat labeled “5% fat.” The positively framed choice—the label that uses the word “lean”—will always be more preferable than the negatively framed choice.

The scientists who conducted the Yale study argued that, since their capuchin monkeys demonstrated loss aversion, and since monkeys are closely related to humans, loss aversion is an inherited characteristic, innate to all humans and primates, as opposed to a learned characteristic.

Frank, however, has problems with that conclusion. “In order for us to conclude that loss aversion is something unique to humans and primate species, we have to test for other animals as well,” he says. Frank is using six of the Psychology department’s pigeons to test them for loss aversion. To do this, Frank and his thesis advisor, Professor Timothy Hackenberg, along with a few others, will put pigeons in small rooms with touchscreens. Similar to the capuchin monkeys in the Yale study, the choices will have to be presented to the pigeons nonverbally, for obvious reasons.

The pigeons will have a choice of two options: a side of a touchscreen with three squares on it, and a side with one. They associate the number of squares with a certain amount of grain. Whatever set of squares they choose, however, the pigeons will receive the lesser amount of grain half of the time and the higher amount the other half of the time. Frank hopes to find whether the pigeons shy away from using the side that gives less than or equal to the amount of grain indicated on the screen, as opposed to the option that gives more than or equal to the amount of grain on the screen. Though the chances of getting a certain amount of grain are the same no matter which set of squares the pigeon chooses, the negatively framed option—the set of three squares, where they may get less than they expect to—may be less appealing to them. If so, pigeons demonstrate loss aversion.

Frank stresses that there are differences between the Yale approach and his approach to the experiment. For one thing, Frank says that it’s important that touchscreens are used in the process, as opposed to human experimenters. “In their experiment, they had experimenters who played the same role each time. For instance, the positive frame would only available from one experimenter, so there’s a possibility of experimenter bias.” Frank also says that the capuchin monkeys in the Yale experiment were born in captivity and were used in other simple economic experiments, which may have affected the results of the study. Frank says the Psychology department’s pigeons, on the other hand, have a more controlled history.

Frank says he was interested in this thesis topic because he was unsatisfied with the conclusion that loss aversion was “innate.” He says, “I prefer explanations that consider the interactions between genes and environment. It’s silly not to consider both.”

Though Frank says he will probably find that pigeons, too, are loss averse, he also believes that no matter the outcome, he will find out more about the nature of loss aversion. “If we do show pigeon loss aversion, all the things humans have constructed aren’t necessary for that trait to develop,” and environmental factors may play a bigger role in loss aversion than the Yale researchers thought. “If we don’t show loss aversion, then something unique to humans and maybe primates causes loss aversion,” he says. “It’s a win-win.”
