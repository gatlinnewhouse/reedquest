[#14] Your short blond hair reminds me of the field behind my childhood home before they burned down, changing my life forever. I look forward to buying a black coffee no room from you again next Wednesday night. ðŸ™‚

[#15] I heard you talk in bio lab.
  
Those upperclassmen can be so mean. I dig amish chic.
  
Wanna meet me at my fort, eh?
  
PS. FortÃ©.

[#16] You: Bearded, tan, just came back from taking some time away from Reed. Saw you at KRRC DJ training last Thursday and admired the name of your show.
  
Me: Junior whoâ€™s tired of having an empty bed. Come cuddle with me and we can watch some Law and Order

[#17] To the girl who runs this place. Your dark eyes caught me in a trance and I almost crashed into you on my bike. I apologized and made small talk. I asked you what your major was even though I already knew. Senior political science major. Driven. Fun. Flirty. Breathtakingly attractive. I wonder what it would be like to run my fingers through your dark curls. Let me buy you a drink sometime?

[#18]Â Chestnut hair artfully blown over your eyes, parted with intention, sitting intently, looking @ your computer screen,Â as if its the most engaging econ or the most tasteful porn. Leaning for your tote-bag, artfully showing your ass crack. IÂ know we had a connection, I just donâ€™t know what that connection was.

[#19] We broke it down at the Blue Velvet. I never knew a man who could bust a move like that to Michael Jackson. Your hips donâ€™t lie&#8230; I was the hungry girl. P.S. Donâ€™t be afraid to dance again!

[#20] Brains, beauty, badassery. Legs.
  
Happy birthday. Or late birthday.
  
(As in I hope your birthday Wednesday was awesome + I think youâ€™re superfly).

[#21]Â You: missin my connection ;). At the corner of bouncy bridge + botsford, you winked behind those smexy glasses.
  
Me: has a phatty friend crush on you. i winked back. be my valentine?

[#22] I see you outside the library smoking cigs, wearing earthtones and a leather bag. I like yr prepubescent charm. You probz like Werner Herzog & Iâ€™d SO love to watch 5 minutes of a Herzog film with you & then make out!!!

<3 Roses are red,
  
Violets are blue,
  
Letâ€™s listen to Best Coast
  
Just me & u <3
