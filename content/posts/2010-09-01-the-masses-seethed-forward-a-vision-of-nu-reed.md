I had no intention of going to Noise Parade midday on Friday. I felt old and sluggish, disinterest in the affairs of new Reedies who would never know the pleasure of the Book of Ships or chant the first line of the Iliad. The event was even printed in the Orientation schedule; a genuine noise parade seemed impossible when they knew it was coming.

But then I thought of my freshman experience. I remembered the flaming bicycles, the screaming upperclassmen, and that guy who dressed up as Jesus and danced on top of one of the dorms. I&#8217;ll admit that I had seen pictures, but they hardly prepared me for the sheer sensory overload I experienced. I knew then that I had to be there in splendid madness for the freshmen, even if the administration had a hand in it. I pulled on my day-glo leggings, grabbed my vuvuzela, and flew out the door.

I&#8217;m disappointed that I&#8217;ve heard so many upperclassmen disparaging the incoming class this past week. Sure, they may seem naive and make a lot of unspported declarative statements, but they are yet unshaped clay. We all know that you&#8217;re not a Reedie until you run screaming after the Doyle owl, cry in front of a professor, or stare down fifteen blank pages in the depth of the library armed only with your wits and a thermos full of coffee. Give them time; they have yet to face the fire.

Have some hope! I led a SEEDS odyssey before Orientation, and saw the incoming freshman class engage in some of the most heartfelt and civil conversations I&#8217;ve seen at Reed. Your conversations with them may be shallow and lack depth, but right now they still face overwhelming amounts of information. How can you expect them to discuss something deeper than their hometown and first impressions of Reed in five minutes when they hardly know their way around campus? Slow down. Your classes have barely started; you can afford to get to know one or two. Grab the ones you like and take them to coffee. Show them around Portland. _Be kind._ Olde Reed is dead, yes, but this year has only begun.

Caught up in the parade, I melted into the crowd and composed frightening sounds with my instrument of noise. As I cast my gaze across the roving horde, I realized that something once bewildering had become normal, almost commonplace. The fireworks and chaotic music brought back a tide of memories, and I swear that in the dim light I saw a ten-foot tall puppet and at least three pikachus. The march may have been organized, but it was still our din. I felt at home.
