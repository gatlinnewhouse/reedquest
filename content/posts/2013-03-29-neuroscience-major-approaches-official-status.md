After a year and a half of planning a new neuroscience program at Reed, Initiative organizers Leah Cepko ’15, Psychology Professor Paul Currie believe the major will be official and in the course guide within the next few years. Also involved in the planning of the program is Biology Professor Suzy Renn.

With 18 major requirements, drawing from psychology, biology, chemistry, physics, and math classes, neuroscience was introduced to students as an unofficial major at a meeting last year and again on March 5 this year with approximately 15 students in attendance. According to Cepko, students have already begun submitting interdisciplinary petition proposals and she expects the first unofficial neuroscience majors to graduate in 2015.

Even though neuroscience is not an official major yet, professors from the biology and psychology departments have agreed to override some of the prerequisites from each discipline for those interested in the program. By waiting to introduce neuroscience as an official major, faculty from each department involved can gauge student interest, says Currie.

“The neuroscience discipline is currently an ad hoc interdisciplinary major,” Currie says. “It’s something we can do. Both departments have agreed to be flexible in what students can take. It’s an opportunity to gauge interest, and a major that does not significantly burden any of our resources.  If we establish a major, we need faculty consideration and approval from all departments. We’d have to address all sots of questions like what happens when a key course is offered and the professor is on sabbatical. We are trying to deal with those questions now but what is most key and critical is demonstrating interest.”

Of great importance to Currie is creating a community between the biology and psychology departments.

“Students in the program have a network on campus with students who have similar interests in the field,” Currie says. “Neuroscience is not just about experience in the classroom and lab, what can we do outside classroom. Part of the program is a journal club that will help direct research experience, support students, and provide opportunities to learn about what is going on in the neuroscience community.

“This new program would feed the enthusiasm of students who have had exposure to neuro in high school. We want to respond to that interest and attract students that have that interest. My thoughts are that right now, prospective students see that there is no neuroscience major and do not give Reed a chance even though we have the foundation.”

Despite the fact that the neuroscience discipline has more requirements than any other major at Reed except bio-chemistry, the program offers some flexibility, according to Currie.

“We do acknowledge it’s heavy, but we picked out what is key and critical,” Currie says. “These classes are essential to what we’re trying to do, which is to establish a set of broad courses that are foundational to neuroscience.

“It will be challenging for students, but it’s manageable with planning. We hope to meet students early on and have info sessions and organizational meetings. It’s heavy on the surface but these would be courses they would be taking anyways if they were really committed to studying neuroscience.”

Looking to the future, Currie worries about the logistics of a neuroscience thesis. Currently, students would have to take a junior qualifying exam in both the psychology and the biology departments.

“The real concern is that you require thesis advisers from both departments,” Currie says. “What we have thought about doing is having a primary thesis adviser identified and then another secondary one in the other department. Students get the best of both worlds. The thesis will almost exclusively be in that primary adviser’s lab, but you’ll get input from both on generating the thesis, methods, and looking at data.”

After taking both intro bio and intro psych last year, Cepko began researching a possible major encompassing both disciplines with a focus in neuroscience.

“I was starting to become more intrigued by psych and bio spring semester, and I began looking into pursuing neuroscience,” Cepko says. “It seemed that it was there and it wasn’t. There were multiple classes on the subject and professors were split between bio and neuro. I thought it was odd that there were 6-9 professors in a field that is so prominent but there wasn’t a major. Students really had to make a decision between the two disciplines.”

While both the biology and psych departments have classes on neuroscience, Cepko feels an established program is necessary because the two departments are in different academic groups.

“A lot of people think of biology or chemistry as ‘hardcore’ sciences,” Cepko says. “Psych on the other hand, is sometimes considered a ‘soft science.’ These perceptions create a very intimidating atmosphere for students who want to take classes in the department they are not majoring in.”

“In the psych department there are neuroscience classes where you’re learning a lot about neuroscience field work but the classes are missing the micro-level framework,” Cepko says. “In biology, on the other hand, there are upper level classes that give you the tools to understand the mechanisms of the brain. There are some components of neuro, lab work and the chemical components but you don’t learn all the details. Either way you go, you only get half the understanding. I wanted to create a program that provides a more full understanding.”

Although all the classes included in the neuroscience major are already established courses in the course guide, Cepko believes that not all students interested in the field know which courses to take without the official framework.

“Not having an official major is an issue, and it’s not an issue,” Cepko says. “If you are a psych major, you have an allied field like bio or chem. But some don’t know what courses are relevant to neuroscience.

“I could be a bio major, and take the courses I want. It’s possible but isn’t probable for most students. I am a little bit of an outlier. I wanted to create a framework for students who were interested. I think it’s much easier to plan your studies when you can see possible tracks.”

Looking to take classes that would fulfill premed requirements, Emily Merfield ’16 first heard about the neuroscience discipline through an email sent to everyone on the psychology email list.

“I’m interested in the program because I was trying to decide between psych and bio and this program combines the two,” Merfield says. “Originally, I wanted to apply to schools with a neuro major and that’s one of the reasons why I considered not coming here. In general it has a good balance of bio and pysch.”

While the program fits into her schedule, Merfield is uneasy about the program’s flexibility.

“It’s pretty restrictive, but as long as you’re okay with mostly sciences and math, it’s totally doable,” Merfield says. “Also, two quals is a thing that’s concerning for me. There’s also the whole issue of not being in a department. I’d be working with professors across departments. It would be nice to have a home base.”
