In case you were curious, it’s not our information sessions. It’s not the visits we make to their high schools, or the brochures that litter their mailboxes. It’s you, current students. It’s what you say on tours, or in class, or when you run into them after our office closes. When you help a prospie find his way, or invite one to sit with you at dinner, that does more to show him that Reed is a welcoming and tight-knit academic community than anything we could do.

I remember being a student in April. Final Hum papers, decisions about majors, qual results, and the thesis. But, I also remember being a senior who was lucky enough to work in the Admission Office in April &#8211; where loving Reed is a necessary element of the job. As an intern, I was forced to share over and over again why Reed is the place I call home. It’s humbling in that regard. Papers feel more enjoyable when a prospie is listening to the description with bright eyes because she can’t imagine ever getting to write a paper that sounds so interesting.

Do you realize the power you have to spread the best parts of Reed through your actions? It’s incredible.

This is all, of course, a not-so-subtle way of leading into Reed Activity Days (RAD). Think of RAD as a concentrated dose of Reed-at-its-best. Granted, some of these admitted students haven’t learned that it is not appropriate to speak up when they are observing class (don’t worry, you can remind them). But most of them can’t help but be in awe of the level of intellectual discourse that goes on here.

Remember that these prospies are not fully-fledged Reedies – one bad experience at RAD can push away a fantastic student. Instead of scaring them away, share with them the many facets of Reed. Explain _why_ we love studying so much, but also why we paint ourselves blue and run around campus.

Speak carefully when considering sensitive topics. Remember that you’ve been here for much longer than one night; you know the context of these issues. Stay away from broad generalizations – that’s where things get tricky. Please remember that they’re not Reedies yet.

The Honor Principle has recently been (and hopefully always will be) a point of discussion. We hold forums, we have conversations in the Paradox, and we chat about it in the stairwells of our dorms. It’s an ever-present and ever-evolving part of our community. Every now and then, I hear students say that they think it’s dead (which, for the record, I don’t think is true).

How about this for awesome: if you want to ensure that the Honor Principle doesn’t die, RAD is your chance. There will be over 200 admitted students on campus today and tomorrow. TWO HUNDRED. Last year, almost 50 percent of the students who attended RAD ultimately chose to attend Reed.  _You_ can influence close to half of next year’s freshman class. Let me repeat that: if you want to ensure that the values of Reed live on, then for God’s sake, show Reed at its best this week. These are your future peers. Treat them with respect.

As always, this is our community, and we take care of each other. Lend a hand, answer their questions, put on a smile. For these two days, remember that the stress you have about your work is actually something you _love_. Why Reed? If you need a reminder, we have about 230 students who are eager to help you remember why.
