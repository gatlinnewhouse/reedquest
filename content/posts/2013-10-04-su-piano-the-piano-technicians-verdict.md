Yesterday I took our piano technician over to the Student Union to assess the damage to the piano.  Although I had previously taken a look at the damage, my heart broke again when I comprehended the brute force it took to destroy the instrument, and yes, it is destroyed…beyond repair.

The damage done:

  * All 69 dampers were ripped off.  The dampers sit on stiff wires that are very difficult to break.
  * Several keys had the white coverings pulled off.
  * The fallboard (the solid piece of wood that covers the keys) was split in two.
  * Several black keys were snapped off.
  * Two black keys were pulverized.
  * Two white keys were broken in half. Keys are 19 inches long, 1 inch thick and made of solid hardwood.

The extensive damage to the piano took someone a long time and great effort. Pianos are tough. They are hand-built and made to last. During the move to the PAB, one piano fell down a flight of stairs and the other fell off the dolly and hit the pavement. Both survived with only minor scratches.  This Chickering piano was 87 years old and had many years of life left.  I am greatly saddened that someone could brutally vandalize this fine old instrument.
