The job application for the Executive Assistant to the President is three pages full of expectations and duties. The final responsibility is perhaps the most important, and facility in this area is what makes someone with this job truly effective.

“[One must] perform other related duties as assigned,” Kathy Rose remarked, as she quickly printed out a copy of the application for me, found in one manila folder among many in the third file cabinet down from the top. “This is the key to the job, because [my job is to do] whatever I need to do to help the person sitting in that office [the acting President] do what he needs to do.”

If you think this job sounds daunting, well, you’re right. Behind her crowded (yet shockingly organized) desk, Kathy has file cabinets filled with information about the President’s schedule and budget, his relationship with campus committees (which most often she is a liaison for), and every minute marked down in Board of Trustee meetings, where she acts as the assistant secretary.

Though this already seems like a lot of work, there is still more to be done. As Kathy puts it, “The job is kind of like being Smokey the Bear, because I’m the one that is putting out the fires.” She says that a love of figuring things out, solving problems and helping people is exactly what you need to be great in this position.

With this in mind, I asked the twenty-two year veteran how she thought her successor would do, now that she is retiring to spend more time with her husband, dog and the chorus. “Oh, Dawn’s gonna be great!” Kathy said with a smile. “She’s energetic, loves solving problems, is genuinely a really fun person to work with and wants to do what’s best for Reed.”

Dawn expressed the same sentiment, but with a clear air of humility, saying, “I think this job is an opportunity for me to use the skills I’ve learned here to help Colin in his Presidency.”

Dawn is currently the Director of College Relations Operations and has had fourteen years of experience already. She explained, “I can immediately hit the ground running [in my new job] and be useful… I’m looking forward to getting to know about other parts of the college and being in greater contact with the student body and faculty.”

Dawn, who will take her new position in December, is currently looking for her own successor, and will be busy with that task as well as all of her regular responsibilities up to the last minute. Her desk is equally full as Kathy’s and as I walked in she offered me something from her drawer.

“Here,” she said, “have one of these cards. I guess in a little while they really won’t be of any use.”
