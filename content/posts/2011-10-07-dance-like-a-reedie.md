A blues dancing epidemic has emerged on campus. There are Reedies dancing in Winch, in the SU, in Commons… anywhere there’s a flat surface. These dancers were infected at the Thursday night P.E. class titled “Lindy-Hop and Jazz Dance,” currently taught by Kayce Spear ‘03 and Jae Wilson. The class is a combination of faux threats, faux sexual advances and real dancing. In the two years it has been offered, it has created a pathological need to dance. It encourages students to dance anywhere and everywhere. Mica Peacock, ‘13, has succumbed to the illness. “Once you get in the habit of listening to music with your entire body you dance everywhere,” she said.

Rather than treat the sickness, ambitious youngsters Lucy Bellwood ‘12 and Tess Myers ‘13 created the group Blues On! last year. Blues On! had a humble start, hosting a few non-public dances with no financial backing at the beginning of last year. However, it has grown greatly in the last year; in last week’s funding circus, Blues On! was allocated $702.00. Current signator Chris Cogell ‘14 has big plans for this money.

These plans are large and varied. Cogell has already hosted a blues clinic (an informal dance session with built-in feedback time), and plans to hold one a month for the rest of the semester. He also plans to offer “blues labs”, which are two- or four-hour long teaching sessions geared toward developing a specific set of skills. In addition, Cogell plans to hold monthly dances on campus. The first of these dances will take place Friday, October 7th. Myers exclaimed, “I’m so stoked that this is happening again&#8211;the first day I showed up on campus this year, I had people accost me, demanding more dances. I’m so proud of Chris.” Attendees and DJs will be a mix of local Portland dancers and Reedies, as many Reedies have insinuated themselves into the blues dance community and culture in greater Portland.

Blues dance, which originated in the late-night poorly-lit back rooms of swing events, isn’t just happening in Portland, though!  It’s a global community. Instructors Spear and Wilson actually met dancing in Heidelberg, Germany, where Wilson grew up. There are regular blues dances and annual blues events all across the country and the world, and a core group of Reed dancers have attended events in Boston, Aspen, Bellingham, and Portland over the past year. Both at these dances and locally, Reed dancers have started competing in blues competitions. Bellwood finished as a finalist in a Portland Jack and Jill competition, which entrants enter without a partner, over the summer.

Not that blues dancing is just a summer event.  Myers led a bike caravan to the weekly blues dance at Lenora’s Ballroom (6th and Alder) this Tuesday.  This weekend, Portland is hosting an exchange titled the Portland Underground Exchange&#8211;two dance venues, two house parties, and one barbecue.  The exchange, only $7, will require many volunteers. One dance-heavy household, including residents Myers and Wilson, will be hosting around twenty people for the weekend.  “It’s the experience.  Having all these people in a house who are all there for the same reason&#8211;it’s good,” Myers commented.

Support for Blues On!, and blues dancing in general, has grown so vastly and rapidly, far outpacing anyone’s expectations.  It seems that these Reedies, at least, and likely many more, will continue to dance, both on and off campus, for much longer than their six required quarters of P.E.
