Police are hunting for a serial killer who is plaguing New York. The death toll reached eight victims on Tuesday when three bodies were found on a Long Island beach. This is terrifying news for those among us who are diehard fans of Law & Order and have watched every single episode of SVU. Where are Benson and Stabler when you need them most? This is just a little too real…

Haiti has a new president! Popular carnival musician Michel “Sweet Micky” Martelly, who has previously never held political office, laid claim to nearly 68% of the vote. Though some are skeptical due to his lack of experience, most attribute his popular appeal to his status as a political outsider. And after last year’s devastating earthquake, the Haitian people could use a reason to celebrate.

After diplomatic cables that discussed alleged police corruption in Ecuador were released via WikiLeaks, the U.S. ambassador in Quito, Heather Hodges, has been asked to leave the country immediately as her status has been changed to persona non grata. Hodges refused explanation as the documents are considered stolen goods and she cannot offer comment. However, one would imagine that her reaction would be along the lines of the following: “DAMN YOU, JULIAN ASSANGE!!!”

A man was kicked off a Horizon Airlines flight in Portland for being too tall. At 6’9”, his legs only fit by sticking out into the aisle. Damn heightists!

Unemployed people of Portland, rejoice! Chase Bank has announced it will open six new branches in Oregon by the end of 2012, and the company says that the new locations will create jobs for construction workers, vendors, and (upon opening) branch employees. Yay for jobs!

On that note, unemployment in Oregon has dropped to 10 percent. It’s only a drop of .2 percent from February; but, hey, we’ll take what we can get.

Arnold Shwarzenegger is pairing up with Stan Lee to create a forthcoming animated television show that will be called “The Governator.” I kid you not. Even better: his opponent is an organization called Gangsters, Impostors, Racketeers, Liars, and Irredeemable Ex-cons – known as G.I.R.L.I.E. Men for short. Who else is really excited?

Californian Stevan Todorovic, who ran a $6 million scam offering mystery shopper and bartending jobs to thousands of people across the country, was sentenced Monday in federal court. Apparently Todorovic set up bogus certification programs that would lead to referrals, and he set up companies to market and sell these programs by placing ads in newspapers nationwide. Don’t kick people while they’re down – employment rates still suck. Shame on you, Todorovic!

Pandora is in hot water. The popular radio streaming service that offers personalized stations is being investigated by federal authorities over information it collects from listeners. Also in the news: the NY judge in the Limewire case ruled that the company may be liable for damages per song instead of per album. Yikes. That’s a lot of damages, if my iTunes library is any indication…

Christian Slater is doing something! After, like, not doing anything for the past five billion years. He’ll be starring Breaking In, Fox’s new series that also stars Bret Harrison (remember Reaper?). And it’s directed by Adam Goldberg. Sounds AWESOME!!

BREAKING DAWN SEX PICS TWEETED! Just kidding, they’re not that scandalous. They’re just stills from the set of the upcoming Twilight sequel, which, incidentally has a PG-13 rating. In the photos, Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) are seen lying in bed together. Hardly sordid, but I’m sure it made some nine-year-olds gasp.

Teen pregnancy is at its lowest rate in the past two decades! In 2009, approximately 410,000 girls aged 15 to 19 gave birth in the United States. It’s a 37% decrease from the teen birth rate in 1991! At that time, 61.8 births per 1,000 females was a teen pregnancy. Now it’s only 39.1. See? Sixteen and Pregnant and Teen Mom are doing good things for our country (maybe)!
