On Thursday Senate discussed next year’s theme dorms, Appointments Committee bylaw changes, free condom availability, approved [the Top 40 budget][1], and allocated funds to Women’s Rugby for an event. Senator Dana Loutey ’12 addressed a proposed gender neutral bathroom in the chemistry building and said that she had sent out an email to chemistry majors regarding the issue.

Student Body Vice President Aidan Sigman ’13 revealed three new theme dorms for next year: literature, circus, and guerrilla art. Senator Shabab Mirza ’13 noted that Residence Life committee wanted both the circus theme dorm and the guerrilla art theme dorm to broaden their appeal.

Senator Sarah Carlisle ’13 said she emailed Kate Smith, Director of Health and Counseling, about lack of funding from Residence Life and Health and Counseling for condoms in dorms. Currently, said Carlisle, condoms are provided by the student group Safer Sex Society. Carlisle said that Senate funding for Safer Sex Society would not decrease if the administration did not provide funding, but that if Residence Life and Health and Counseling began funding Safer Sec Society, Senate funding may change.

Senate approved a Top 40 budget of more than one hundred two thousand dollars. Senator Marie Perez motioned to freeze Reed Shooting Sports Collective’s funds as RSSC and Senators seek lead-free ammunition at a discount from an alumnus who is involved in the production of iron-tungsten-nickel composite ammunition. Perez said she wanted to raise RSSC’s budget to allow the group to obtain lead-free ammunition if no discount could be had.

Mirza brought up Beer Nation funding. Perez asked why the group had been allocated such a large sum of money. Loutey said that Beer Nation will be holding an additional event this semester, and Sigman added that the group was receiving one thousand dollars less than last spring. Mirza said that while Beer Nation only provides for those older than twenty-one, both students and alumni expect events to continue. Senator Torra Spillane ’12 noted that Beer Nation’s events are more costly than other groups. Loutey said that Senate doesn’t use Funding Poll ranking to decide funding.

Student Body President Brian Moore &#8217;13 raised the issue of Women’s Rugby funding. The team requested four hundred fifty dollars to host game that took place on campus on Saturday. Women’s Rugby recently [lost funding from the administration for league play][2] following the resignation of their coach. Mirza motioned to allocate three hundred dollars to the team. It was noted that one hundred sixty dollars was needed just to arrange the game, and that the rest was being used for a social following the game. According to the Women’s Rugby team, the social is expected of them as hosts. The motion was passed. Perez said that Senate was funding the team because they were organized and had long been planning the event, and emphasized that Women’s Rugby was not being allocated funds on a whim.

Carlisle opened discussion about proposed Appointments Committee bylaw changes, which she said were written over break. The proposed changes establish a quorum for the committee and establishes a “consensus minus one” system of approving applicants. During the Renn Fayre Czars approval process last semester, there was miscommunication and confusion between members of Senate and past Renn Fayre Czars, which were probably the impetus for proposed changes. Ex-Senator Jenny Calvert-Warren ’12 noted that the proposed change would limit the number of advisers who can be present at applicant interviews. For some positions, e.g. Judicial Board, members of the body to which the applicant is applying sit in on the interview and advise Applications Committee during the approval process. Mirza said that having a lot of people at an interview can be intimidating. Carlisle said it would be hard to mediate an interview if seventeen people were present, which would be the case if all of Judicial Board decided to attend an interview. Carlisle emphasized that Judicial Board advisers would still be an important part of the decision making process.

Spillane said that having Judicial Board or Honor Council members outnumber senators during an interview allowed those advisers to have an unconstitutional influence on senators’ decisions. Carlisle repeated that it was Applications Committee’s priority to move to a consensus based system. Senator John Iselin ’13 said he thought it was important to limit the influence of advisers. Perez agreed, arguing that the proposed change was a “guard against nepotism.” Carlisle claimed that there have been few instances when senators on Applications Committee have disagreed with the recommendations of advisers. Loutey noted Senate raised the issue because it wanted hear student body opinions.

Sigman noted that Finance Committee is now meeting at 7:00pm on Sunday instead of 4:30pm.

The motion to adjourn came with surprise and relief from all that the meeting ended one hour and five hundred words earlier than the [last one][3].
