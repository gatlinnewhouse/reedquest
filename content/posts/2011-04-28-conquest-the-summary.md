So, you all elected ConQuest as your Quest Board for the fall of 2011, and that’s great.  We appreciate it, we really do.  But some of you—those who don’t frequent SIN, perhaps, or who didn’t attend Elections Assembly—are probably wondering what is this ConQuest thing?  Well then.  We are a group of eleven students (yep, eleven) who wish to focus on informative reporting and relevant, respectful opinions and dialogue.  Some key issues that we were previously asked about:

• We will continue to post the Quest online.  However, we will only do so after a week-long waiting period and will refrain from posting specific articles if requested to do so.

• As for “undo[ing] the ‘absolute nullity and general cowardice’ of the Quest,” Alex Walker promises to do some muckrakish investigative reporting, potentially on topics like the truth of Bon Appetite’s claims, Reed labor practices, and dorm utility use.

• If we get too many submissions for a single issue of the Quest, some articles that are not time-specific will go into the next edition.

• If asked by administration or Student Senate not to run an article for a reason other than simple factual inaccuracy, we would have to review why they were making this request as well as why the article was written in the first place.  If the article in question is fair and unbiased but controversial, we believe it should probably go to print.  If the article is at damning or slanderous or contains any breach of privacy, we will probably agree with their request.  Of course, these will be judged on a case-by-case basis and there will always be exceptions.

• How are we going to work together?  We each have a specific task for Quest Board and on top of that there will be a rotating triumvirate to keep us all in line.

• Six of the eleven of us have previous journalism experience.

• There will be “funny shit.”  It  will have a different title.

Write us next year if you have any more questions!  Also, we would like to add that if you are unhappy with the amount or quality of the content we publish, don’t just complain about it to your friends – write for us! It’s not that hard, and the whole student body will appreciate your brilliant contributions.
