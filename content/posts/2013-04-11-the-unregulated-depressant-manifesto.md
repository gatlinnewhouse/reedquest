_**By Unregulated Depressants**_

It has been two months since Paideiagate, and we have found that we can&#8217;t quite shake ourselves of the bad feelings that the incident has instilled in us. This, we think, provides a problem for The Powers That Be, since they seem to rely on the student body&#8217;s short memory span when it comes to &#8220;controversies&#8221; – that &#8220;this will all blow over,&#8221; that we will forget their transgression once we have gotten our collective giggles out in some sort of dramatized community event (in this case, the followup Reed Union, which we see as having had a placating effect in addition to its obvious constructive ends). And worst case, even if we don&#8217;t, we will all eventually graduate anyway and they will get a clean slate of students upon which to continue their long-term project.

We do not want to let ourselves forget this event. Instead, we want to commemorate it. We have wanted to do something to extend &#8220;institutional memory&#8221; to the students, whose time here is brief and busy, and whom we cannot wholeheartedly blame for getting distracted from matters such as these. The question is this: How can we better carry these memories with us?

One response–our response–is to make artifacts of the memory. We made some pins. With them, we want to especially commemorate President Kroger&#8217;s masterful use of legalese. So we have adopted his term &#8220;unregulated depressant&#8221;: this was his name for the source of the &#8220;significant health and safety issues&#8221; that caused the cancellation of the first Paideia class. Its intended usage was to distance his constituents from the benign reality of the herbs which were to be smoked in the class, and in so doing to slyly convince us of the unacceptability of their consumption. But it seems to us that the herbs are less the liability than the students themselves, regardless of what they&#8217;re up to. Our very existence is, for him, a “significant health and safety issue,” and very little more than that. President Kroger et al (it is crucial to stress that this problem is systemic, and not limited to the President) wish to constrain those parts of us which remain unregulated, and to prevent us from &#8220;depressing&#8221; the administration&#8217;s active, fervent expansion of authority over student affairs. And we find pleasure in the danger we pose to them (among other feelings).

We have already disseminated the pins around campus. In addition to piles in central places (bathrooms, in/around the SU, the scrounge, the Paradoxes) we have pinned them to posters for other Reed-related events, so long as those events promote those aspects of life that would escape the experience of a purely legalistic life (e.g. creativity, criticality, autonomy, beauty, pleasure). Feel free to take one. There will be more. Please join us in our resistance of forgetting.
