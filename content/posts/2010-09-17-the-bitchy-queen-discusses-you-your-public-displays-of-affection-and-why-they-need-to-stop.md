I’ll take my dinner without a show, PLEASE!

Or any meals with soft-core porn for that matter. Honey, don’t make out in front of me when I’m trying to eat.

This article goes out to couples who find it appropriate to swap tongues while waiting in line in Commons, and those who continue on while sitting down. Your definition of trying each other’s food is not something I find appetizing. If fact, rude bitches, it makes me lose mine.  I like my spinach in my own teeth.

There is nothing inherently wrong about a public show of affection but there is a time and place for everything. Once you’ve crossed over from cute to gross, it’s time to stop. Saliva strings are not cute. Morning breath is not sexy. I don’t care what kinky shit your partner is into. And don’t even get me started on public fondling; I don’t need to know what color bra you’re wearing, while I’m waiting for a sandwich.

Piece of advice, and this is on the same note &#8211; don’t do it during lectures, respect your professors and trust me, they notice.

If you want to do these things at a party or in the sex loft in the student union by all mean please do. Sex on the front lawn at night, hell I’ll even cheer you on for having the courage. Trying to increase you immorality quotient, great. I actually support it; I’m a hedonist at heart.  I support your exhibitionist spirit, and I invite you to perform your skills during fetish ball.

But, my stomach can only take so much.

So Bitches, get a room!!!
