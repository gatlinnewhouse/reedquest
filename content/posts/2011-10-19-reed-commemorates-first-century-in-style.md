Food! Glamour! Fireworks! Sharon Jones! Even more food! The Centennial weekend celebrated Reed’s “sweet 100” and showed us the best of Reed in a celebration filled with all the things Reedies love.

The Centennial Weekend kicked off with an impressive variety of finger food, including chicken skewers, miniature tacos and sandwiches, dumplings, and desserts. The sheer formality of the event was mind-blowing, and the food, while occasionally dry, lived up to the high expectations. Lines were long, but the food was plentiful. The feast was punctuated by the arrival of Drum Korps in their full Renn Fayre-esque swagger, sans only champagne and glitter residue. Drum Korps, alongside the Drum Korps dancers, led the Reed students, alums, faculty, and staff to the massive tent on the front lawn for the Centennial Program.

The interior of the tent was swanky, with red stage lights and chandeliers combining to create beautiful patterns along the front wall and ceiling. The Program itself resembled nothing so much as an awards show (it even had musical interludes). A special appearance was made by Portland mayor Sam Adams, whose partner is a Reedie, as well as videotaped “happy birthday” messages from the Portland Timbers, Jane Lubenchko (the head of the NOAA), and Senator Ron Wyden. There was a nostalgic centennial slide show, as well as some elaborate dance performances choreographed by Reed dance professors. Reedies got their first glimpse of the Oregon Public Broadcasting&#8217;s documentary “Reed,” which looked promising. There were a couple of speeches by trustees, as well as the “Connections” section of the program, in which the work of Sasha Kramer &#8217;99, who works to create fertilizer from human waste, was explored. There was also a hilarious speech by Richard Danzig, recipient of the Thomas Lamb Eliot Lifetime Achievement Award and former secretary of the navy.

The program closed with a speech by Colin Diver, followed by a student chorus singing a poem written by a Reedie called “Reading Homer” interspersed with the first two lines of the Illiad.

The highlight of the night was a performance by Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, which went well beyond the 10 PM cutoff. The performance was truly inspired, with the band taking the opportunity to involve the audience in every detail of the performance. Sharon Jones brought so many Reedies on stage to dance with her that she eventually had to cut them off. The group proved to be a great choice to bridge the musical tastes of young Reedies and older staff.

Centennial Saturday was less about Reedies, and more about the surrounding community. The Quad was filled with children and parents from the neighborhood. The chemistry demonstration answered one of life’s grand questions: “How many balloons can you blow up with a Tesla Coil?” (Answer: Many, many balloons.) The pet parade displayed the furry cuteness of many neighborhood dogs, as well as the occasional guinea pig in a shoebox. The food cart “Hot Pink Taco” looked strangely out of place next to a bean-bag toss.  The Patrick Lamb Band played some mellow soul, and the Oregon Ice Works cart was so popular that it ran out of sorbet. There was, as always, a moon bounce. Whiffies fried pies, sadly, failed to show up to the event due to a vehicle breakdown.

The early hours of Saturday were also marked by a couple other events: the 5K, which had an attendance of 324, exceeding its goal of 300, and the orchard dedication, which over 150 people attended. For more information about these events, check out the articles on page __\_\\_\_and \_\_\_____.

At seven o&#8217;clock, the movie “Raiders of the Lost Ark” was shown on a giant inflatable screen. Giant inflatable screens probably cost a lot, but clearly the student body needs to acquire one.

Following the movie, there were fireworks on the West Lawn. The fireworks show proved to be a significant step up from the generic show at alumni reunions. It was an inspired show that ended with a blinding deployment of dozens of fireworks.

The Centennial Celebration, in many ways, was an attempt to create a brighter future for Reed through community outreach – and a successful one. CEP director Beth Martin noted, “The feedback from the Reed community, from neighbors, and from the general public was very positive. People appreciated being invited to campus, and everyone had a good time.”

All in all, the Centennial was both an amazing, over-the-top celebration as well as a commemoration of the elements that make Reed what it is. Hopefully, a hundred years from now, our Reedie grandchildren will be able to honor the bicentennial with even more splendor.
