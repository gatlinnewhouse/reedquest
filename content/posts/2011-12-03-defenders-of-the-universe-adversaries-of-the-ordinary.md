Glass rained down on the floor of the Student Union Monday night. A flying bowling ball missed its mark and smashed into a light, shattering its glass enclosure. This was the first of what may be many mishaps as a result of the enigmatic supergroup Defenders of the Universe’s, or DxOxTxUx’s, latest installation, the Mega Skeeball. The Mega Skeeball, a scaled-up version of the amusement park favorite, found its way into the Student Union on Sunday.

Reedies have long been scratching their heads at DxOxTxUx, a student group that produces creative wooden installations for the entertainment of the Reed community. There’s little chance that there will ever be a complete understanding of DxOxTxUx, also known as Defenders of the Universe, but the mystery of their name can be put to rest. “We just thought it was funny,” concludes Physics major Zach Babb ’13 after a short moment of reflection.

It would be foolish to expect a more satisfying answer from a group like DxOxTxUx. From its conception in 2000 by Michael Hoppa ‘04, James Ford ‘02, Geoffrey McNamara ‘05, and Zach Babb, as a response to CHVNK 666’s layabout ways, DxOxTxUx has consistently defied the limits of what should be possible from a school with no engineering program. DxOxTxUx’s work has attracted the attention of everyone from _Reed_ magazine to _The Atlantic_. Prolific as they are, they have still managed to maintain just the right amount of mystique to keep the respect of the Reed community. “We’ve tried really hard not to be dicks about it,” said Zach Babb, a tradition that students would likely want to see kept up in the future as DxOxTxUx finds more fame and egos begin to flare up.  However, for the time being DxOxTxUx has the market cornered in ingenuity and creativity.

DxOxTxUx’s most recent creation, “The Beest,” is a kinetic sculpture that works with a series of twelve individual legs that gracefully propel it forward. “The Beest,” a recreation of the “Strandbeest” creation by Dutch artist Theo Jansen, is the latest in a long line of creations incorporating remarkable technical know-how and elegant user interface. Unfortunately “The Beest” is about as fragile as it looks, and it broke upon its introduction at Renn Fayre last year. However, DxOxTxUx is resilient and rebuilt “The Beest” over the summer, reintroducing it in the SU earlier this year where students have enjoyed playing around with the wooden structure during study breaks.

The story of “The Beest” is no isolated event in the history of DxOxTxUx. The DxOxTxUx tradition seeks to “take things that are working and take them a big step forward,” said English major David Lansdowne ’11, a senior member of the group. This is certainly reflected in the Motorized Couch Collective. Following the enormous popularity of their first foray into the world of creation, a motorized couch. DxOxTxUx created bigger and better couches year after year, fine-tuning the design each time.

The ephemeral nature of each project is something that members of the group have been forced to come to terms with after witnessing the extreme abuse their projects consistently take at events like Renn Fayre. According to Zach Babb, “projects are going to be fleeting.” However the short lives of their creations have kept DxOxTxUx on the cutting edge of innovation. Lessons learned from previous builds are incorporated into new designs, but there are no elaborate blueprints for their projects. Building from memory would seem to many professional engineers chaotic and unorganized, but to DxOxTxUx it provides the chance to learn from past mistakes and discover entirely new ways to approach complicated engineering problems.

The DxOxTxUx philosophy has implications that run far beyond the building of awesome but impractical creations. Babb speaks to his desire to “take the time to learn something practical.” Through his time in DxOxTxUx, Babb says he has come in tune with his inner handyman: “When I look around my house I know how to fix things.”

For Lansdowne, the group provided him with the insight that it is possible for him to effect change in the professional world . “You can get into any of these disciplines to keep them running as they have been but it’s really fun to take things a step further” he says. His sentiment to create change is echoed by Babb, who says, “A big part of college is coming to the realization that progress is being made by regular people.”

DxOxTxUx is making small steps to challenge the notion that an outlandish idea is just that. For DxOxTxUx there are no ideas too ambitious, only people lacking in ambition.
