# Reed’s Expedition Kayaks the Pacific

Almost two months in, and the expedition is going swimmingly. The _Quest_ has recently received an exclusive transmission from Reed’s expedition team, which is comprised of five students, including Reed’s beloved Ben Reed, Ted Hume, and Doyle Clark. (Sadly, none of the Religion Department faculty will be joining this mission, as they worry that the group might travel through Mexico City.) This team, nicknamed “the Odyssey,” left Reed on Saturday, February 10, traveling across the world in one longitudinal journey to test whether or not Thomson & Craighead’s temporary sign installation in front of the library is truly 24,859 miles away from itself.

The team left roughly one week after the sign was installed in a demand for truth and fulfillment of the life of the mind. The Backpack Co-Op was ransacked for supplies, including several pairs of snowshoes, a pocketful of JUULpods from a Co-Op manager, and one kayak. Applause from all accompanied the team’s farewell, except for Mike Brody, who was heard saying, “They should have left on Friday, just sayin’.”

As Ben Reed reported in a message brought to the _Quest_ by carrier albatross, the Odyssey is currently kayaking across the Pacific Ocean with two students in tow, pulled along on snowshoes instead of water skis. A brief pitstop was made in the Galapagos Islands, where John Kroger was allegedly visiting in a mad attempt to avoid his own office hours.

Unfortunately, the expedition team found John Kroger’s residence empty, with a mere note taped to the door, stating that all students must write their intended topic of conversation, roll it up in a bottle, and throw it into the ocean, as he is in the Galapagos with no intent to discuss Wells Fargo or his taste in rugs any further.

The Odyssey has no knowledge of the recent events on campus, as the carrier albatross has settled into the newly built pool and refuses to leave, instead awaiting its daily meals of crustaceans from Bon Appetit. Central Kommittee has decided, luckily for the team, that the students forming the Odyssey are indeed not traitors to the Student Soviet, and will in fact be awarded medals upon their safe and informative return, whenever that may be.

According to Ben, the team has been making remarkable progress using the guidance of Google Maps. As for the kayak, Google Maps reportedly instructed the team to cross the Pacific Ocean by kayak before changing its mind and flat out refusing to help the expedition team with its ridiculous questions any further. The team has since been using Bing Maps to reach Antarctica instead. Doyle hopes that there will still be ice when they get there, and maybe a couple mice as well. 

The _Quest_ reached out to Thomson & Craighead for comment, but the only person to reply was a community member named Craig H. Thomson, who said, “24,859 miles is a long ways—that seems right to me.”
