# Aged and Beautiful

![](/uploads/2018/04/13/tree2.JPG)This tree, wrinkled with age and lined at its base with lovely spring annuals, likely dates back to the first planting of trees on campus in 1933. _Fagus sylvatica_â€™s thin grey bark has historically been described as resembling elephant skin, and its leaves, unlike many other deciduous broadleafs, can range in color from yellowish green to orange or even purple.
