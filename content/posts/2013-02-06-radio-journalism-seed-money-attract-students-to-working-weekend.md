Hundreds of students took the chance last Saturday to attend an event they had been receiving emails about for weeks on end: Working Weekend, a program put on by Career Services, the alumni committee Life Beyond Reed, and Alumni & Parent Relations (APR), to provide current students with insight and connections from Reed alumni in their respective fields. One hundred and ninety-one students and young alumni and 95 alumni attended the weekend.

The three-day-long event began Friday evening with Reed Startup Lab, a workshop in entrepreneurship, and Radio Bootcamp, led by Robert Smith ’89, New York Correspondent for NPR, in which students studied radio journalism. Both continued for the duration of the weekend.

The Startup Lab hosted investors and entrepreneurs to advise Reedies with ideas for startups. The lab culminated in a round of pitches from participants seeking a $2,500 prize from investors. The money went to Connor LaBean &#8217;14, Anjuli Dharma &#8217;14, and Ben Stephens &#8217;14. Their product, Genebot, a “platform for DNA sequence handling and cloning,” is designed to eliminate some manual labor from genetics research.

Four concurrent panels of alumni from fields in science, politics, law, and media began promptly Saturday morning and continued throughout the day. Among the panels in the first session, which was held from 9:00 to 10:15 a.m., was “Law in a Time of Cholera,” which consisted of four alumni from different areas of law.

“I felt like I didn’t have a lot of guidance in college,” alumnus Andrew Schpak ‘01, now a lawyer in Portland, says. “I’m happy to be a resource to anyone who wants information. Reed is a small enough community that I feel a desire to help people who went to the same place as me.”

Amy Bogran ’89, who also spoke at the 9 a.m. law panel, told the students in attendance, “You’ve got to come to us. We are happy to talk to you. Call me, ask me.”

Bogran also related sentiments on her time at Reed, bringing even groggy students to laugh: “Me and my classmates always had the feeling that we were going to be asked to leave at any moment.”

At approximately the same time, a student sporting a Gumby costume made an appearance in Eliot Circle, representing the Reed Switchboard, a volunteer network with the goal of connecting students and alumni. Gumby handed out snacks and asked passersby to fill out index cards to explain what they could teach him.

The panels resumed at 1 p.m. and ranged in subject matter from writing to capitalism and finance.

During the Write, Edit, Publish! Panel, alumna Elly Blue ’05, one of the four panelists, spoke about writing feminist bicycle zines.

“It was interesting to see what you could do with an English degree,” senior Katharina Schuaiter says. “I didn’t think that such a niche interest could make money.”

Student Kristen Collins says that when she talked to Blue after the panel, Blue suggested she email her about an internship.

“It was really great to meet people,” Collins says. “It’s a possible contact.”

Student Maddy Engel says the panel taught her about the business aspect of writing, something she had not learned about before.

Saturday evening concluded with MeetUps, in which over 60 students talked with alumni one-on-one. Students signed up beforehand to talk with four alumni of their choice, each for only ten minutes.

“I had a fantastic time. It was great seeing so many alumni and students connecting. I can only imagine how amazing things will be five years from now. Yesterday morning I was making a list of people I wanted to follow-up with and got up to 30 in no time and I keep thinking of more,” alumnus Erik Speckman says.

Immediately following these short sessions was a post-panel party, where students and alumni continued to schmooze.

Throughout the day, alumni served to augment students’ thinking about their careers after Reed.

“You get the idea that you can’t do anything but school,” Engel says. “But these people contradict that.”
