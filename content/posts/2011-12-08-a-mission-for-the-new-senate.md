**Trigger warning: discussion of sexual assault**

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1116" title="senate" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/set.jpeg?resize=180%2C147" alt="From Facebook, where The Quest has more fans than they do." data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]

“What improvements do you want to see in Reed’s sexual assault policies?” “Do you know which demands on the petition from last year have not been met?” “Do you think that someone who has been convicted of sexual assault should be allowed to be an HA, senator, or J-Board member?”

These are some of the questions I asked senators at the elections assembly, and I am worried about the responses I received. Some of the candidates suggested that we should wait and see what the new assistant dean wants to do.  Some wanted to wait to see how the new special hearing board for sexual assault cases would perform in the next semester.

Over the past few months, Reed has made significant institutional changes in the way it handles sexual assault, but none of us should be content with how much progress that has been made thus far. There are still changes that need to happen.

All students should understand the significance of sexual assault on campus. In just 100 hours last spring, 58% of the student body signed the petition written by Students for Sexual Assault Support Services (SSASS) last year, which laid out specific demands for changes to sexual assault policies. Anyone who was here last year should remember [the petition created by SSASS to call for policy reforms.][2]

None of the senatorial candidates, however, seem to be aware which two of the four demands on the petition have not been implemented. One demand is that Reed hire a liaison for the Women’s Center so that it would be more like the MRC. The other request was the one most likely to make people uneasy—“Release and make publicly available the identities of all individuals found guilty of sexual assault consistent with the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX and FERPA.”

That last one does not mean there would be a list of names hanging somewhere for everyone to see.  Part of the purpose was to point out to the administration that J-Board’s [gag orders on sexual assault victims were illegal][3]. Another purpose was to make sure administrators and staff know if someone who’s applying to be an HA, senator, or other position of power on campus has been convicted of sexual assault.

According to Mike Brody, there are currently no official restrictions on people convicted of sexual assault from running for senate or becoming an HA. This is worrying because that means someone who has ignored the Honor Principle can be in a campus leadership position. Futhermore, anyone hurt by people in those positions might be more afraid to report the assault. The Reed community should also consider whether it is safe to keep people with multiple sexual assault accusations against them in campus positions. Not all reports of sexual assault lead to a formal case.

So here is my challenge for the next Senate: come up with and implement more improvements in the way Reed handles sexual assault.  Also, pay attention to the discussions around campus.

Ending rape and sexual assault at Reed is an ongoing struggle against the ignorance about sexual assault embedded in our culture. As individuals and a community we must continuously question whether our actions perpetuate this ignorance. To the students elected who were vague on the petition’s demands and what could be done, go research rape culture and sexual assault at Reed. There are multiple student groups concerned about sexual assault, articles on the Quest website, and information in student ‘zines. To the students elected who said they were aware of and troubled by sexual assault, show that you care enough to do something about it. We should not and do not need to wait for the administration’s guidance to come up with ways to make Reed safer.

We cannot afford to be passive about sexual assault issues within our community. Many sexual assault victims at colleges leave school not only because of the actual assaults, but also because of the difficulties they face when they report. Yet many offenders get to return. We, as a community, need to prevent assault from happening and support survivors. We can do this by learning about consent and rape culture, pushing for policy changes, and addressing ignorance. The Senate should use its position to keep the administration and student body aware of sexual assault. Additionally, it should be exploring what further improvements can be made.
