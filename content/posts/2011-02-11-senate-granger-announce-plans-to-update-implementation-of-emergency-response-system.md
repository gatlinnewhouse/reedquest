Five years ago, before Justin Bieber sold over 4.5 million records and when Pink actually had cultural significance, the Reed Senate decided to make the new Emergency Notification System opt-in for all the student body. This meant that to get emails, text messages, or phone messages sent to you from the CSO Office during an on campus emergency, students had to sign in through Iris, in the Personal Info section. Not many people, in these five years, have chosen to opt-in, and “significantly less than half” of the current student body is part of the system, says Gary Granger, Community Safety Director at Reed.
  
Because of the lack of participation, the Emergency Response Team (ERT) has proposed to make a change, so that for email messages only the system would be opt-out, meaning that students would immediately receive emergency notifications to their Reed emails. The proposed change has people nodding in agreement.

“This is one of those problems that was an easy fix, and not a difficult decision for us to make, which was great.” Said Senator Schwartz, the Senate representative who sat in on the ERT meeting when the change was proposed. Schwartz noted that the previous Senate chose to make the system opt-in because they feared the notifications would bombard students with “bookstore spam” and other hoards of school information. Perhaps ironically, Schwartz noted that this was happening anyway, and praised Granger’s approach to only using the notification system when absolutely necessary.

“We’ve used [the system] several times,” said Granger, who noted that it is from his computer that emergency notifications are sent out. “The most recent one was in December when we had the person on campus who was believed to be suicidal and armed.
  
So we used it many times during that incident to update and give instructions.” Granger also mentioned that the emergency notifications can sometimes be sent out after the fact, and not always to the whole school body. A few times during the first semester, fires were started in the Apartments by cooking accidents, and the CSOs sent notifications out only to the facilities and media staff. “We wanted to mobilize the facilities staff as well as the media staff very rapidly to get the clean up done and also answer any media inquiries that came in, because the fire department came in.”

While there has been enthusiasm to put the new plan in place from the ERT and Senate, the actual time of its implementation is still unclear. Granger voiced his wish to not have the plan erected without clear enthusiasm from the student body, and suggested releasing a questionnaire about the issue in the next SB Info. As well, if the current student body is highly opposed to the issue, only future Reed students could be put into the opt-out system, and any students who started with the opt-in system could be grandfather claused into the old way.

Schwartz however, doubts that there will be any backlash to the change from the student body. “Gary Granger seems to have a very responsible idea of how to handle this [system], and if he gets out of hand, that’s why we have Senators on school committees.”

The Senate has requested that the ERT – which is composed of a staff member from every operational group on campus, a faculty representative and a student representative – hopes that after completing this task they can move onto perhaps a bigger issue in emergency notification: how to convince the student body to opt-in to the text message and voice message emergency notification services, because, as Schwartz put it, “if you’re away from your computer, you want to be aware of what’s going on.”

Though Granger doesn’t want to make any decisions without the student body’s first approval the statements he have been making are very clear: “the more people who participate the better, and the easier it is to do that the better…Sign up [for the system].
  
Go to Iris, go to Personal Info, and sign up.”
