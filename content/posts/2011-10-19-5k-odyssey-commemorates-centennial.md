Sing to me, muse, of the swift-footed competitors of the Reed 5K Odyssey. When young Dawn with her rose-red fingers shone once more on the idyllic Reed campus Saturday morning, runners and walkers alike came together at Eliot Circle to support local elementary schools. The sky was gray, but dispositions were sunny as participants crowded around the well-staffed registration center to pick up their race bibs. Colin Diver made an appearance at the starting line, wishing racers well before they embarked on their odyssey around the five-kilometer course laid out earlier that morning. Around ten minutes after the race was scheduled to start, a voice atop a scissor lift told runners to congregate at the starting line. As at the start of any odyssey, a great deal of emotion swirled amongst participants. Nerves ran hot, stomachs churned, “Eye of the Tiger” played over the loudspeakers, and runners kissed loved ones goodbye before the air horn sounded, signaling the beginning of the race.

Participants crossed the starting lines as they took their first steps onto the new course, which began with a steep hill up Woodstock. Amidst the sound of traffic speeding up Woodstock, runners pounded their way up the hill, shaking the cobwebs off their joints and, finding their strides. Runners kept steady paces throughout the race, seemingly satisfied with their respective positions. Although runners were afforded a short reprieve from hilly terrain after the initial rise up Woodstock, the course soon returned to its unpredictable self with a healthy mix of downhills, uphills, and flat terrain to keep runners entertained. Forks in the road were staffed with encouraging race managers who guided runners in the right direction and blasted an assortment of inspirational tunes over tinny boombox speakers. The race coordinators made the outstanding decision to have the course wrap through the “bouncy bridge” which was more bouncy than normal thanks to the bounding strides of the race’s 290 participants.

The parallel between the route chosen for the Reed 5K Odyssey and the route of Odysseus’ own voyage were apparent in the many illogical twists and turns the Reed 5K Odyssey took, presumably in an effort to stretch the course out to the standard five-kilometer distance. Upon reaching the finishing line, racers were disappointed to find no loyal swineherds and few spectators to congratulate them on completing a difficult and hilly 5K race. Maybe next year race coordinators will consider offering a free pancake breakfast to those who greet runners crossing the finish line.

After the race, runners made their way to the pancake breakfast that was offered for “free” to those who had paid the $25 registration fee. Arguably, the breakfast was not worthy of its $25 price tag.  However, it provided runners at Reed with an excellent opportunity to meet one another and discuss the latest and greatest in shoe technology and gossip about celebrity marathon times over bad coffee and dry pancakes. Winners were also announced at the breakfast, with Pau Whittredge finishing first overall with a time of 17:05. Janet Rosenthal was the overall female winner with a time of 21:40.
