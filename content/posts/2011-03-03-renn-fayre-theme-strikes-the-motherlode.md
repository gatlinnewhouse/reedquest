    Renn Fayre Unveiling.

“Do you know those guys?” a friend asks me as we cross campus for pre-party festivities at another friend’s apartment. We’re passing by a group of completely unfamiliar looking youngsters who look suspiciously underage – it looks like tonight’s festivities are about to be enjoyed by some of Cleveland High’s finest as well. But right now, that’s the farthest thing from my mind. I’ve been waiting all semester for tonight: the Renn Fayre theme unveiling.

Renn Fayre, that much anticipated and totally-worth-the-hype three-day event that is the highlight of every academic at Reed, is still months away, but I’ve been dreaming about that magical May celebration since last June. Right now, it seems to be just within reach.

Reedies, usually scarce on campus on Saturday nights, were swarming the GCC by 11pm. Excited, drunk students broke it down to some LCD Soundsystem on the SU dancefloor while others hung around outside, eagerly awaiting the stroke of midnight when this year’s splendiferous theme would finally be revealed. And by 11:59, the SU was packed with sweaty bodies all staring hopefully at the screen projections. When the video introduction began, the hall was filled with cacophonous hollers and hoots. Midway through, a group of students began chanting “OREGON TRAIL! OREGON TRAIL! OREGON TRAIL!” But by the end of the five-minute video montage, which included clips of cowboys, Nelly and his posse of video hoes, Beyonce, the Oregon Trail video game, and copious amounts of bling, the words “GOLD RUSH” flashed overhead, and the audience erupted into a deafening roar of applause and shouts.

Later reactions were mixed. Said senior Louis Melendez, “I was looking forward to a Mormon-themed Renn Fayre, but Gold Rush should be fun.”

Another student said that they were excited for this year’s theme, but “[didn’t] see what Gold Rush has to do with castles.”

Others were more practically inclined. One senior asked, “If this year’s theme is Gold Rush, does that mean that Renn Fayre is going to be funded by 1-800-CASH-4-GOLD?”

Freshman Chris Lu is optimistic. “I’m definitely looking forward to Renn Fayre,” he said. “I’ve never seen any other themes, but it seems cool.  Kind of strange, but interesting.”

As the festivities wound down for the night and attendees dispersed for bed, enthusiastically discussing costume ideas with friends, the air sizzled with electric elation.

Finally, the procession toward Renn Fayre, and the end of the year, is underway.
