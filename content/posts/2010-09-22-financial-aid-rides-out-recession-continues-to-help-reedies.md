Last year the New York Times focused a story on Reed College faring in the face of the recession. A year later, the country’s economic recovery has slowed, and likewise, so has Reed’s. Like other schools, Reed is faced with the challenge of how to do more with less, including providing financial aid to a growing number of applicants who need it.

The aspect of financial aid covered most heavily in the Times article was the college’s “need-sensitive” admission policy. Reed, like many liberal arts schools, takes into account how much of the total tuition an applicant can afford before inviting them to attend.

Leslie Limper, Reed’s Director of Financial Aid, explained how the need-sensitive admission process works. The Admission department goes over applications they receive and compile a list of the students they want to admit. A student’s financial status is not a factor in this step.

The list then goes to the Financial Aid office, which calculates how much it will cost the college to give these applicants the assistance they need to attend. If the amount is greater than the Financial Aid budget for incoming students, applicants have to be cut. The Admission department must then decide which students they wish to accept and which they cannot afford to include. This process happens “behind the scenes,” said Limper, before any acceptance letters are sent out.

Once a student is admitted, the college commits to providing for their demonstrated need throughout their Reed career. Limper explains that assisting continuing students is a priority for Financial Aid and, as a result, has a great deal of influence on how much financial aid can be offered to incoming applicants.

Freshman Mary Hepburn says she hasn’t felt the repercussions of the recession in her dealings with Financial Aid. When she read The New York Times article about Reed’s reported financial aid problems, she feared she would not be able to afford the cost of attendance. She wrote to Reed asking to be considered an independent minor because of her father’s death and her estrangement with her mother. She was granted independent status and qualified for $49,000 per year in aid.

But as more applicants qualify for assistance, Reed is feeling the pressure to increase its financial aid budget. According to President Colin Diver, Reed was forced to increase its aid budget by more than ten percent in the last school year alone.

To achieve this, especially after a marked decrease in the value of Reed’s endowment in 2008, Diver explains that cutbacks were needed in other areas. For example, the student-to-faculty ratio drifted to nearly 11:1 for the 2009-2010 school year. However, by the fall of 2010, the ratio returned to 10.4:1.

Before the recession Reed was close to being need-blind, but Diver did not feel comfortable declaring need-blindness until the college had maintained this status for two or three years. “It’s not honorable to claim that you’re need-blind unless you’re need-blind,” he explained.

Reed’s Centennial Campaign has had a major impact on the increase in funding available for Financial Aid. The campaign is expected to raise a total of $200 million for the school by 2012.

According to Diver, one fourth of this will go directly to the Financial Aid budget.
