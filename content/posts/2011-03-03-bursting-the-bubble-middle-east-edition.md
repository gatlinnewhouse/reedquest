**Libya**
  
Protesters have taken over much of the eastern Libya in a set of bloody riots and demonstrations. Gaddafi, who has ruled for 41 years, has used helicopter gunships, fighter jets and mercenaries to keep the protesters at bay. The government is trying to hold on with an iron fist, even executing soldiers who refused to fire on civilians. The UN has even kicked Libya of the Human Rights Council claiming “a gross and systematic human rights violation”.**Morocco**
  
Protestors in Morocco are calling for more modest reforms than the ousting of King Mohammed VI. One banner highlighted on english.aljazeera.net read: “The king should reign, not rule”. The largest of the peaceful rallies occurred in Morocco on February 20th, and included 37,000 people (according to the countries interior minister). The king has promised political reforms but has yet to follow through

**Algeria**
  
Protests in Algeria have been forcefully suppressed by President Bouteflika. The protest on February 12, having at most 10,000 people, faced an opposition of around 30,000 policemen. A much smaller crowd rallied on February 19, but it was also stopped by Algerian police. Bouteflika hopes to stifle protests by promising to lift the emergency law instituted in 1991, which limits the freedom of speech and assembly and cancelled elections.

**Tunisia**
  
Tunisia was the spark that ignited the Middle East. When a street vendor set himself ablaze after having his wares confiscated, more than 5,000 people marched in his funeral procession. Tunisians summarily protested for nearly a month over governmental corruption and a lack of individual freedoms. More than 200 people were killed by state militia before President Ben Ali fled the country and a coalition government set up in his place.

**Egypt**
  
Egypt was prominently featured as tens of thousands of individuals protested in Cairo’s Tahrir Square, calling for the ousting of their autocratic president Hosni Mubarak. After 19 days, their inspiring protests ended in celebration as Mubarak stepped down from office, eventually handing over control to the countries respected military. The country is now putting together an interim constitution until elections are held later this year, which will hopefully be the first honest elections in the country in 30 years.

**Lebanon**
  
Whereas an autocratic ruler has caused protests in many of the Middle Eastern countries, it is the sectarian leadership that has brought hundreds to the streets in Lebanon calling for reform on February 27th. Whereas the protestors believe the leadership (dividing control between the countries different religious sects) is, as a protestor in Beirut put it, “the cause for corruption, poverty, and civil war”, the opposition believes that a different political system would take away equal rights from people of all beliefs.

**Saudi Arabia**
  
King Abdullah attempted to head off protests with a 36 billion economic incentive package which will create jobs, increase wages and subsidize housing. It is doubtful Saudi Arabia will face the same kind of protests sweeping the rest of the region.

**Oman**
  
On February 27, two were killed in a protest in Sohar against Sultan Qaboos bin Said’s rule, which is rife with corruption. The peaceful protest evolved into a violent clash when police attacked protesters with weapons. In an attempt to calm citizens, the sultan ordered the creation of new jobs and checks to job seekers to help abate rampant unemployment and a stagnant economy.

**Iraq**
  
Thousands have protested in Baghdad, clamoring for better services, more jobs and less corruption. At least 12 people have been killed by security forces and the Iraqi parliament is currently adjourned.

**Iran** 
  
Despite Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s political opposition, being under house arrest, protesters fled to the streets on February 14 for an encore of summer 2009’s Green Movement protest in what were widely believed to be rigged elections. Protesters were stopped by police and three were killed. Protests resumed on February 16 in honor of a student killed. The government has threatened to execute Mousavi and Karroubi for their alleged participation in the organization of the riots.

**Jordan**
  
Protests over economic reform caused the Jordan’s King Abdullah to fire his entire cabinet and promise changes in policy and reform. Nevertheless, thousands of Jordanians protested on February 18th. Social mobility in Jordan has been particularly challenging due to economic stagnation, which has been so crippling that college educated men and women regularly cannot find jobs or afford apartments.
