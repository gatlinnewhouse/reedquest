Funding Poll is tallied, and congratulations are in order for those organizations that raked in Top Six and approval points. But I’m not particularly interested in where our Top Six votes went, rather I’m more occupied by what organizations we seem to really dislike. I’m talking the things people hate enough to dole out one of their precious Top Six/Bottom Six votes, even though the scoring system wages more points to Top Sixes than it does to Bottom Sixes. The votes are in, and while Deep Sixers make up just a small proportion of Funding Poll voters, I think it’s worthwhile to look at a breakdown of what we dislike, and just how much we detest it.

Of the 79 organizations listed on funding poll, 49 organizations received at least one Deep Six vote. 22 organizations received five or more Deep Sixes, and eight organizations have the distinction of receiving more than ten Deep Six votes.

Of the eight groups with more than ten Deep Sixes, some of these groups still manage a high ranking: CAVE at no. 4, WMD no. 11, and Beer Nation coming in at 15. Other groups make the coveted top forty: SLUR at no. 26 and FSU at 28. And then there are those that fall short: RSSK at no. 42 (despite 62 Top Six votes), OFCS at 63, and Fine Cigar Club at a lowly 71.

So, what do we learn? Reedies have a love/hate relationship with meat, guns, and beer, and seem to think it’s ok to hate on women, Christians, and people who like fire. Oh, and cigars and tobacci don’t receive a great following either.

Now, I’m pretty willing to understand not wanting your student body funds to go toward guns, beer, or tobacco. There’s that whole “we’re hippies” thing, something like three quarters of campus can’t drink legally, and most of campus doesn’t smoke.

After living in ODB my freshman year, I can almost understand hating on Weapons of Mass Distraction. Trying to sleep through a burn when they’re practically underneath your bedroom window is pretty near impossible. As far as Deep Sixing CAVE goes, I’d like to remind everybody that they deliver us tasty vegetable kabobs as well as delicious, delicious meat. I’m going to write off those Deep Sixes as ignorance of the great services CAVE delivers to eaters of all persuasions.

However, dear Reedies of mine, some of the Deep Sixes cast are just plain shameful. I’m rather upset with the 16 people who thought it was ok to Deep Six Oh For Christ’s Sake, and the 8 people who Deep Sixed Hillel. OFCS is a non-evangelizing student group that has sponsored events such as pancake feeds and service trips to homeless shelters, and both OFCS and Hillel serve religious groups oft overlooked by the “Atheism, Communism, Free Love” attitude.

I’m really pissed at the 16 people who Deep Sixed the Feminist Student Union, and irate with the five who gave Deep Sixes to the all-inclusive safe space Women’s Center. Seriously Reedies—where is this hate coming from?

Even the one jerk who Deep Sixed Queer Alliance, and the one who Deep Sixed the Black Student Union (Asian Student Union received no Deep Sixes, but one more disapprove vote than BSU) have my panties in a twist.

After three years here, I have no illusions of Reed being a utopia, but Reedies, we can do better than Deep Sixing student organizations that serve populations otherwise underserved on campus. Next time, don’t waste your precious Top Six votes on bringing down organizations that bring a little diversity to campus. And quit hating on CAVE too.
