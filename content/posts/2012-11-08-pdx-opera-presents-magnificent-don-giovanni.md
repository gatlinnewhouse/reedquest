Looking at the barren, monochrome stage or reading a plot synopsis detailing a slew of thoughtless sexual conquest won’t make Don Giovanni look like a rich production. Going to the Portland Opera’s production this weekend will change anyone’s mind.

The superficial simplicity gives the show a special power. At any given moment the morality, genre, music, and characters seem in total conflict, and there is nothing present to sort them out. It moves from sexy to funny to deadly serious in an instant. The music doesn’t define the story, it complicates it. Lighthearted dialogue is paired with ominous music and condemnations come are given with a “so it goes” kind of attitude.

The staging serves the same purpose. The minimalist stage can fill with huge shadows, or isolate a character under a fluorescent crucifix. The cross blares to life and forces conventional morality into a situation that is questioning it. By its aggressive presence, the ideal undermines its application. The characters undress and dress, accepting and hiding their impulses and instincts.

The movement and acting artfully create levels where none seemed possible. Actors literally (and figuratively) pull each other across the stage. Every element of the show contrasts stoic self-control and moral rectitude with the desire for freedom and freedom to desire. Right and wrong are devalued in the face of the obvious dominance of can and can’t.

The debauchery is both helpless and premeditated, but nowhere is there even a clean dichotomy. Should Don Giovanni stop himself, or do women discover their sexuality through him? Do they believe he should be punished, or do they want him as he is? The opera leaves the audience with more questions that it asked to begin with. It fully deserved the standing ovation. The educational lecture before the show is also highly recommended. It starts an hour before-hand, in the first balcony. It thickens the mystery.
