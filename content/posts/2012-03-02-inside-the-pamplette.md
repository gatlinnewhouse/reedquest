Despite the prevailing notion that _Pamphlette_ writers are bedecked student clowns, it turns out that they are relatively normal students, whose appearances cannot be distinguished from that of other Reedies. It is also false that they serve as court jesters in Colin Diver&#8217;s home residence. In any case, their weekly contributions to the quantity, if not also the quality, of student laugher is worthy of note. So too is their dedication to the cause of humor. Their motto, coined at conception not so long ago, declares: &#8220;_The_ _Pamphlette_ was created for three reasons, to make the Student Body laugh, educate them about the issues of the day, and ensure the election of Michael Dukakis.&#8221;

The senior Pamphlette contributor, Jeff Blum &#8217;12, explained, &#8220;We spend less time promoting Michael Dukakis nowadays, but the spirit of our 1987 founders still remains  relevant.&#8221; The prolific writer Ann-Derrick Gaillot &#8217;13 added that “the point of the Pamphlette is to be funny. That&#8217;s it. And we try really hard, but even when we&#8217;re not funny I think we are still sending a message to the campus that we need humor to get through our day to day, especially when most of our readers are reading long, dry academic articles all the time.&#8221;

However, not all Pamphlettian self-proclamations are Quest kosher. Popular jokesmith Hailey Jones &#8217;14 claimed that, &#8220;_The Pamphlette_ is better than _The Quest_ because we literally think of everything from scratch, and have to come up with new material every week. There are no set guidelines or CSO blotters to take up space, so every article is a new creation, new format, new everything.&#8221;

The Pamphlette displays confidence despite the controversy that their humor has incited. Jones added, &#8220;as much shit as we get for past [mistakes][1] (which were, indeed, [mistakes][2]) we are not afraid to take risks. So we&#8217;re pretty much the bonafide badasses of the school. We have letterman jackets and we snap when we all walk together.&#8221; This behavior, although entirely unknown to other students, contributes to _The Pamphlette_&#8216;s unique niche in Reed society.

Surprisingly, _The Pamphlette_ runs much like other newspapers. Gaillot explained, &#8220;We come in every Sunday at [1:00pm] and share articles we have written and ideas for articles that we then write during the meeting. We use InDesign to lay out. We spend time talking about if the articles are funny or not, and we leave out those that are not. We try to be especially aware of if any article is potentially offensive or not. We&#8217;re trying to be funny, not cruel.&#8221;

The elusive writer/artist &#8220;Boots&#8221; Beutell gave a more realistic picture. He said, &#8220;Honestly, _The Pamphlette_ is organized chaos. We write as many articles as we can in a week and post them to a [Google Docs] page. We look at them together and start putting it into the format everyone has come to know and love. If we still need stuff we write more stuff and add photos.&#8221;

Evidence suggests that Pamphlette writers work out of genuine care not only for the dissemination of satire but also for the process of creating it. Gaillot said, &#8220;I love working on _The Pamphlette_ because I love writing, I love humor, I love putting something out there of mine for people to read that isn&#8217;t mind-numbingly boring. _The Pamphlette_ gives me a chance to practice a different sort of writing than what my classes call for. The best feeling is when someone says one of my articles actually made them laugh.&#8221; Similarly, Jones said, &#8220;I like writing for _The Pamphlette_ because it gives me work to do that I really, truly enjoy. I love writing things that make me laugh.&#8221; With a mind for practicality, Blum proclaimed, &#8220;I like _The Pamphlette_ because it provides me with an opportunity to practice writing comedically and because sometimes on rare occasions professors say nice things about articles I wrote in class even if they don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m that smart otherwise.&#8221;

Although _Pamphlette_ writers may be mistaken in believing that their satirical writing bears more fruit than _The Quest_&#8216;s continual endeavor to merge content and creativity, their comedic efforts are not in vain. Blum noted, &#8220;_Pamphlette_ writers have gone on to write for such prestigious publications as Bitch Magazine, n+1, Slate, Gawker, and The Onion. _Pamphlette_ writers have also gone on to tour with noted comedian Brent Weinbach.&#8221; Unknown as the latter comedian might be, their accomplishments are commendable.

_The Pamphlette_, created in 1987, is far younger than _The Quest_, which published its first issue in 1913. For this reason the former enjoys far less widespread repute than the more aged publication. Nonetheless, there is something to be said for the endurance that a comedy paper demonstrates in existing for any time at all in the shadow of _The Quest_&#8216;s kingdom.

Contentions between _The Quest_ and _The Pamphlette_ are not founded merely upon petty quarrels concerning journalistic integrity but mingle even in the realm of familial ties. Blum revealed, &#8220;I share a last name with _Quest_ Editor Alex Blum, and I have on occasion tried to introduce him to people as my cousin and he has always angrily denied our relationship as though he is embarrassed to be fake cousins with me, which is just insulting. I respect him enough to pretend that his dad and my dad are brothers, why can&#8217;t he return the favor?&#8221;

The Blum-Blum conunblum holds metaphorical weight in relation to the inter-publication strife. Although the rivalry is far from ended, we may be in the dawn of a new time in which _The Pamphlette_ and _The Quest_ can co-exist as fake cousins.

This article does not mark an end to the fierce and long-lived rivalry between _The Quest_ and _The Pamphlette_. However, given the dissimilar function that each serves on campus, it is not damaging to recognize the merits of the opposing team. There was surprisingly little enmity to overcome during the interviews with _Pamphlette_ writers that contributed to this article. In fact, most of them appreciated the act of solidarity accomplished in reaching out to them.
