The virally famous and controversial documentary _Kony_ was shown in the Reed Chapel by the Invisible Children organization on Monday. The event, co-sponsored by the Multicultural Resource Center, filled only about 1/3 of the Chapel. Some students had expected a larger turnout given the flaming discussion the movie is currently igniting over internet forums. The film and post-film discussion were organized by 3 full-time Invisible Children volunteers and a girl named Sylvia from Northern Uganda who is traveling with the team.

The Invisible Children movement describes itself as &#8220;a global community of young people that galvanizes international support to bring a permanent end to [Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army] violence through mass awareness campaigns and strategic advocacy efforts.&#8221; The recent _Kony_ documentary is part of an effort to capture war criminal and Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony, in 2012. As the documentary conveys, the _Kony_ efforts aim to make Joseph Koney famous. _The Washington Times_ recently wrote that &#8220;In 2005, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Kony and several of his top aides for enslaving more than 24,000 children and murdering 10,000 others.&#8221; Invisible Children hopes that if Joseph Kony becomes famous, the U.S. government will continue to support efforts to send military experts (not troops) to assist Ugandan military with the technological support they lack but may need in order to track down Kony.

When the film ended, Sylvia shared her life story, which included years living in fear as many friends were abducted or killed by LRA soldiers working for Joseph Kony. She was honest, open, and kind while telling her painful personal narrative to complete strangers. Reed students in attendance had many questions for Sylvia and the volunteers. Most questions were practical, related to the logistics of the movement. Some students asked about how the movement is handling the huge outpouring of public dialogue about the film, which spans from supportive and positive to ragingly negative. The film has been criticized for factual inaccuracies such as the implication that the LRA currently has 30,000 child soldiers, while this is actually the total number abducted overall, and the focus on Uganda, while the group has actually largely moved to other parts of Central Africa. The film also has gained broader criticism for its primary focus on awareness and its supposed implication that Africa needs the West&#8217;s paternal support to develop.

One student stood up to share many criticisms he has had about the movement, even accusing it of racism. The volunteers answered all of these questions and concerns with patience. They emphasized how strongly the movement encourages the public to educate themselves further about issues surrounding the LRA. They assured the audience that _Kony_ is only a short video that does not purport itself to sufficiently cover the complexity of the issue.

The three volunteers and Sylvia have traveled all over Oregon, showing the _Kony_ documentary to many schools and colleges. Next they will head to Seattle, and later on, to Canada. Sylvia said that 16 other teams like theirs are traveling over other parts of the U.S. doing _Kony_ screenings. By participating, Reed has joined into the international discussion, which will likely continue at least until Joseph Kony is captured.
