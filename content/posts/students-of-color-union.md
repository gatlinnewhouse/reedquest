If you understand the feeling of displacement and misalignment for a person of color in a predominantly white environment, then you must appreciate the rare pockets of non-white space on an all-white campus. In such spaces, like the Students of Color floor of Naito and GCC C-D during POC Confidence Week, students enjoyed the comforts afforded by the brief absence of those who hold an outsize influence on daily life and academic discourse. “We have never been comfortable in our academic spaces and I feel like the white people do not understand that that discomfort is universal for all people of color,” said first-year Aaliyah Hoffman. 

Hoffman, Nalani McFadden, Kathleen Kwenda, Mykal Kelly, Jacob DeFazio, Kacey Romulus, Giancarlo Scotti, Fernando Flamenco, and I started the Students of Color Union (SOCU) in order to reserve a consistent time and place for all students of color to gather and confront their ongoing experiences in school, as well as to host dances and parties open to non-white Reedies. More importantly, SOCU also aims to encourage the different groups of color on campus to work together to bring their shared goals to fruition. SOCU hopes to look back on the incoming class of students in four years and recognize that a tangible difference has been made in what their presence means at Reed. “Currently there are multiple identity groups that are all separate that don’t communicate with each other, and one of our main goals is to facilitate communication between people of color since we experience similar struggles in our everyday life,” said McFadden. 

    SOCU’s goals for this year include: Pushing the administration to draw in more applicants of color, reserving an entire dorm for students of color that can serve as a safe space, starting a POC newsletter, pushing the administration to hire more professors of color, and establishing an Ethnic Studies course (taught by non-white faculty). 

The nine first-years of color decided to establish SOCU during Orientation Week after arriving at this institution and feeling like they were the exceptions to the rules of inclusivity. Despite their varying views on the Hum protests and beliefs about activism, they recognize the importance of combining efforts to affect change in the community. “A lot of people of color are shy to associate themselves or be represented as a person of color, even though they are by birth and always will be. It feels as if a lot of people are shying away from who they actually are,” Kelly said. In taking the first steps to encourage students of color to act as more of their true selves, SOCU aspires to open up dialogue between different identities to combat the standards of whiteness that are treated as natural, inevitable, and innocent. The union hopes that by providing a space where people of color can embrace their ethnicities, they can make a larger impact in academic and social spaces by empowering one another and working with the administration to improve the lives of the marginalized. 

“They don’t understand what we’ve gone through to get to Reed,” Hoffman said. “Reed is not a school that everyone gets into. Reed is most of our dream schools, especially within the POC community.”
