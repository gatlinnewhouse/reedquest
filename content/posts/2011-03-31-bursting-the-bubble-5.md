Eighty-four-year-old James Gronseth of Portland, OR is joining the Peace Corps. He’s going to be stationed in Botswana, where he will use his hospital administration background to help improve treatment for HIV and AIDs patients. The average age of a Peace Corps volunteer is 28, so Gronseth says he’s “bringing age diversity.” Well said, gramps.

A recent study conducted in Portland by Kaiser Permanente found that people trying to lose at least 10 lbs were more likely to reach their goal if they slept between six to eight hours of sleep at night. See? The freshman fifteen is not your fault. It’s the 3000 pages of reading you get from each class everyday.

Since Ford is ceasing to manufacture police Crown Victorias, Portland PD (as well police forces nationwide) are looking for other models. PDX Police are also looking for a new design, and a number of ideas are on the table. A popular choice among the cops? Orange flames over a white background with the words “Here comes the HEAT!” flying behind. If that wins, Portland Police will officially be the coolest cops in the universe.

A 39-year-old tourist from Illinois was struck in the chest and pinned to the deck by a five-foot-wide, nearly 200-lb spotted eagle ray that jumped onto the chartered boat her family had chartered on their Florida Keys vacation this past Friday. The equally surprised ray was eventually helped off the boat and swam away. I challenge you to visualize anything more hilarious.

Britney Spears announced Tuesday that she would be kicking off a tour across the U.S. with Enrique Iglesias. Only hours later Enrique reportedly pulled out of what would’ve been the world’s most mind-blowing tour of pop insanity and left teenage girls across the nation weeping bitter, bitter tears.

Beyonce announced Tuesday she would no longer be using her father as her manager. After fourteen years, she probably took a look at him and said “Upgrade U?”

A list of possible witnesses to testify for the defense in Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s sex scandal trial has emerged, and it sounds more like a VIP section of high-profile pretty faces. Among the named? George Clooney and Christiano Ronaldo. Wow.

Jackie Chan is not dead. Fuck what ya heard on Twitter – the old kung-fu star of B-rated film fame is still alive and kickin’. Literally.

According to a recent study conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter could actually be beneficial tools for young children. It aids in socializing and interaction between children, which is healthy and good. For the first time, I feel better about my twelve-hour-a-day Facebooking habit. Sort of. Later on the study coins the term ‘Facebook depression’, which is used to describe the “classic symptoms of depression” that teens and adolescents began to display after extensive amounts of time spent on the social networking site. Evidently young folks suffering from Facebook depression are “at risk for social isolation and sometimes turn to risky internet sites and blogs for ‘help’ that may promote substance abuse, unsafe sexual practices, or aggressive or self-destructive behaviors.” Hot damn. That explains a whole lot. And as if that’s not enough, the heat is really on Mark Zuckerberg’s baby: parents of a murder victim are suing Facebook after a paramedic photographed their daughter’s corpse and posted the image online using the website.

Apparently a broken heart actually causes physical pain. According to a recent study, social rejection actually activates the same regions of the brain that are involved in physical pain sensation. Ouch!

Erin Brockovich is still fighting! On Tuesday, she urged senators to pass a law to document disease clusters (an unusual number of health events grouped together in a time and location) in the United States. My question is, will there be another movie? J. Roberts’ last big movie (which Peter Travers lovingly renamed “Eat Pray Puke”) was anything but a critical success. America misses seeing a badass woman with a moral conscious fighting the Man in o heels – bring it back!
