_**By Auden Lincoln-Vogel &#8217;13**_

Though I would be insane to disagree, I always feel somewhat uneasy when important community discussions end with extended remarks about how great it is that we can discuss these sorts of issues as a community. I suppose it&#8217;s because this is precisely the sort of conclusion one applauds when there is an overall sense that nobody can change what happened or what will likely happen again&#8230;

But perhaps that&#8217;s a bit too cynical; the other general consensus of Friday&#8217;s Senate meeting is somewhat less viciously circular (or self-congratulatory): that we should always discuss these sorts of issues as a community before making decisions. And I suppose I could hardly disagree with this sentiment either.

But in either case, what is perturbing is not what was said, but what was left unsaid from the get-go: the tacit assumption that formed the basis for the whole Q&A with President Kroger–that certain Paideia classes never happened because President Kroger canceled them.

In fact, certain Paideia classes never happened because instructors chose __not to teach their classes after President Kroger ordered them to be canceled. By conflating these decisions in one &#8220;cancellation&#8221; scandal, by blaming everything on President Kroger alone and by having the president answer for his actions during Friday&#8217;s Senate meeting, the student body has validated the authority with which President Kroger overstepped his constitutional powers (the paradox of this last part should sting at least a little).

Now, this isn&#8217;t meant as a snarky censure of the Paideia instructors, Czars, etc. who, when confronted with a direct order, balked (as I probably would have, too). My point is simply that to be frustrated with President Kroger alone and not at all ourselves betrays a latent (and unimaginative) assumption that is antithetical to the ideals in whose name we claim to be outraged: a subconscious belief that, at the end of the day, it is the President who wields ultimate power and not the Reed community as a whole.

By succumbing to this assumption and playing the easier role it offers us (i.e. outraged victim), we also threaten to erase any meaningful distinction between a community discussion and yet another jurisdictional transgression, between collaboration and coercion.

And, again, I should note: Despite the connotations of the word &#8220;coercion,&#8221; I do not doubt for a minute President Kroger&#8217;s good intentions and that he spoke genuinely when he said something to the effect of &#8220;I do not like fake discussions.&#8221; I am confident that President Kroger was at least as honest as I was when, assuming my gut frustration, I first directed my rational arguments against him.

There is a certain wisdom in the hard-nosed separation of powers within any community. And in a community whose members no doubt have the best intentions, this wisdom has little to do with protecting ourselves from the other&#8217;s potential malice, and everything to do with the fact that we do not know ourselves.
