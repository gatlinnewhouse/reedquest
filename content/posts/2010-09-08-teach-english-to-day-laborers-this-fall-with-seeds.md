SEEDS is hiring volunteers for the fall semester to teach English to day laborers! SEEDS partners with the Voz Workers’ Rights Education Project to teach ESL classes at their Worker Center six days a week. This volunteer position requires a commitment to one class per week, which amounts to about 2 hours per week (this is a FWS eligible position.) We are currently looking for teacher assistants and tutors for the Drop-In Writing Lab. Applications are due on Friday, September 10th at 5pm and there is a tentative training scheduled for the afternoon of Saturday, September 18th. For questions and to receive applications, please email [&#x73;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x74;&#x68;&#x6a;&#x61;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1].
