_Piper Wheeler and Marjorie Nicholson Share Their Experiences_

**A letter from Piper Wheeler**

While I was writing my thesis in Reed’s Russian department, the possibility of going on to graduate school began to seem appealing and even realistic. I didn’t, however, feel prepared to enter a PhD program directly after college, and I began to look for opportunities to spend some time studying less formally for a year or so.  Since I’d known Russian majors from Reed who’d gotten grants before, the Fulbright was a natural first step.  I began work on my application much later than I should’ve—I think I got the whole thing together in a week or two, which I certainly don’t advise—but had great support and lots of help from my advisors and my department, as well as Reed’s Fulbright Committee. After a couple of interviews with the national Fulbright committee, I received word a month after that I was an alternate candidate. At that point I wrote the whole thing off and made alternate plans for the year, so I was surprised when I got a phone call in July asking if I could make it to an orientation in DC the following week (it turns out that a really high percentage of alternates end up receiving the award, so don’t lose faith). Due to some visa issues, my grant period began about six weeks later than expected. The Moscow Fulbright administration has proved quite flexible and helpful, though.

I am living in St. Petersburg, Russia, studying as an auditor at the Philological Faculty at St. Petersburg State University (as well as doing additional, less-official coursework in language and literature at Smolny College, the SPSU Special Faculty and the Nevsky Institute). Most of my time is dedicated to my project, an original translation of Necropolis, a collection of literary memoirs by the Russian emigre poet, scholar and critic Vladislav F. Khodasevich.  I am the first translator to work on this book, and I hope to publish the finished product.

As far as the benefits and drawbacks of the Fulbright grant, I can only speak for Russia.  While I have had a remarkable time so far, it should be noted that over the past few years, foreign scholars have become less welcome in this country.  This trend is manifested in a number of ways; the most salient here is that grantees may have more trouble than expected finding a place for themselves at the university.  I’d guess that it is a good idea wherever you are studying to really try to nail down the terms of your university affiliation/contract before you arrive, if possible, and to find an adviser who is willing and able to work with you.  A great thing about the Fulbright organization is the rare degree of independence it affords young scholars.  While there is a small staff working in-country who are happy to help with certain issues, there is no one holding you accountable; your work, your daily life, and your relationship to your host institution is entirely at your discretion.  I think Reedies tend to do well with Fulbrights because we are a little more self-directed, and more accustomed to taking control of our own scholarship.  For these reasons, too, I think the grant is ideal for someone who cares a great deal about the project itself.  Even though I realized I was really very lucky to have been given this opportunity, and even though my underemployed friends are still jealous of my cushy government checks, living abroad can be lonely and frustrating.  In December, St. Petersburg gets about five hours of hazy half-light per day. You should care a lot about your research.

I ended up applying to graduate school while in Russia, having taken the GREs in Portland over the summer. This was a bit stressful, but went quite well in the end.  I’ll be making a trip to the States to visit schools and decide on a program in the next couple weeks, and then commencing work within a PhD program in fall of 2011. I can’t say for sure how much the grant helped my application, but I will say that my work in Russia made a huge difference in my confidence when I was presenting myself as an applicant.  Being able to talk about both my undergraduate thesis and this large-scale research/translation project in progress made me feel as though I had some grounding in my field.

I have a blog ([dontrushme.wordpress.com][1]) that has been sadly neglected for a while, but might be useful to people considering study in Russia.  Also, any Reedies interested in Russia, Fulbright, or grad school should feel free to [email me][2]!

Vasha,

**Q&A with Marjorie Nicholson**

**What piqued your interest in the Fulbright Scholarship?**

I was working in a lab at the University of Washington doing a summer internship and a grad student I was working with mentioned the program. It sounded like a great way to travel and see another culture, while still pursuing my academic interests. I thought, ‘What a great way to see the world (and one that will also help me get into grad school)!’ It seemed like a win-win situation for me. I also wanted to take a year to really work in an academic lab to decide if a professional career in science was really what I wanted to commit my life to.

**What are you doing now?**

I am working in a neuroendocrinology lab in Gothenburg, Sweden. The lab primarily works with a specific hormone called ghrelin, which was the main focus of my senior thesis at Reed. Only a few labs in the world study this, which was how I came to Sweden. More broadly, I study ghrelin and other hormones that make us hungry, and how they affect our perception of sweet tastes.

**What kind of people would you recommend to apply for this award?**

Absolutely everyone who has a passion for something, wants to travel, and wants to experience a new culture should apply. Don’t be intimidated. Just think: Someone has to get that money. It might as well be you!

**What valuable things have you gained from your experience thus far?**

I have a whole new perspective on the world now. Being in another culture really opens your eyes to how others live and how you want to live. I really believe Sweden is the best country in the world. There is practically free health care, childcare, and education (even university!). Yes, the taxes are high, but the social benefits are enormous. People here really believe in a socialist system that takes care of its citizens. When asked about it, they simply state that you want people in your society to be healthy and happy just like you want them to be literate. It just makes for a more productive society. It’s a very interesting way to view how a society should operate. This egalitarian worldview has really shaped the way I view the world now.

**What are some of the drawbacks?**

Some of the drawbacks involve the extreme competitiveness of lab work. There is a rush to get things published, which means my advisor wants me to work 60-hour weeks and weekends, while I want to participate in cultural events in Sweden and Europe. I also have not really been in control of my own projects and have had to work on projects on which I will not get authorship as the lab intern. This has been a considerable hiccup in my experience here in Sweden, but I have also had to learn to say no so that I can experience the culture.

**What are you planning to do after your year is over?**

This year has taught me that academia is not for me. It also has taught me that I love to travel! So I am joining the Peace Corps and teaching HIV/AIDS prevention and maternal/child health in Central Asia. I will be in Turkmenistan. While I love being in Sweden, this has been quite cushy as far as foreign experiences go. I can’t wait to see more of the world, learn another language, and see how other non-Western people live. I hope to continue having lots of adventures this coming year, and for the rest of my life. The Fulbright was a wonderful opportunity for me, and has really shaped me in a way I didn’t expect. It is a great program and all should apply!
