Students and faculty gathered Thursday afternoon in the Studio Art building for presentations by the recipients of the 2011 Kaspar T. Locher scholarships. As attendees snacked on juice and cookies, ****four students—Alisa Bones ’13, Lucy Bellwood &#8217;12, Nicolas Arms ‘13**,** and Kritish Rajbhandari &#8217;12**—**displayed and discussed the fruits of their creative labors, which they completed over the summer with the help of the $1750 scholarship.

The recipients this year came mostly from the visual arts, with the exception of Rajbhandari, who wrote a collection of poems_._ Art professor Michael Knutson, the chair of the scholarship&#8217;s committee, says that theater, music, and dance projects have received funding in the past, though the applicants for those fields are usually fewer than for the visual arts and creative writing.

The Locher, which is supported by the Kaspar T. Locher endowment as well as student body funding, selects four students each year from a pool of around thirty applicants ****to work on a creative project in dance, theater, the visual arts, creative writing, or music. The money can be used to purchase materials or to pay for summer living expenses while recipients work on their projects.

Bones used her funding to continue an existing exploration of painting with wet media in a series titled _Floating Boxes Spilling Paint_. She executed the paintings, which indeed resemble three-dimensional boxes overflowing with bright, oddly two-dimensional liquid, on flat, smooth wooden panels which she built herself. Bones, who says the project “will definitely continue into the future,” also spent some of her money on trips to New York and San Francisco to look at art.

Bellwood, whose project was an autobiographical graphic novel titled _Wherefore_, says she used the money she received on living expenses as well as on ink and paper. “Comics take a huge amount of time and effort to complete,” she said. “The Locher money gave me the freedom to quit working for part of the summer and really just go for drawing as a full-time pursuit.” She also noted that in addition to giving her the freedom to draw full-time, the Locher forced her to “buckle down and work” on the project even when she didn&#8217;t want to, which she calls an “invaluable” experience.

As the title suggests, Rajbhandari’s collection _Crossing Cultural and Geographic Boundaries_ explored his experiences as a Nepali expatriate studying in the United States and his memories of a different life back home. In a piece titled _Inheritance_, he reminisces about a sacrificial slaughter for a Hindu deity: “Because justice demands it,/there is a dagger on the altar,/next to a lacquered bronze/of the eighteen-handed goddess/whose face is smaller than /the thumb of the boy.” Rajbhandari, an English major, began writing poetry in Nepali in high school, but has only written in English since coming to the U.S. He is currently writing a thesis on the poem _The Comedian as the Letter C_ by Wallace Stevens.

The final presentation of the evening was a 26-minute silent film by Nicolas Arms titled “Watchtower, Nature as Monolith.” Using footage captured during his trip to the Peruvian-Brazilian border region this summer, Arms’ film presents the viewer with a series of prolonged shots of the city and its surroundings. Though Arms had recorded ambient sound at the time, he chose not to include any audio in his film, making it a striking sensory experience. Arms says his project is “part of an ongoing cross-disciplinary project looking engaging with aesthetics of environmentalism and micropolitics of mobility in the southern Amazon Basin.”

The scholarship is named for Professor Kaspar T. Locher, who taught German and Humanities at Reed for over fifty years. Locher created the scholarship in the late 1980&#8217;s and served as the committee&#8217;s chair until shortly before his death in 1998.
