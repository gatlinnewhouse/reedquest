In a statement released on December 19, the Investment Committee announced that they would not be divesting from Wells Fargo. Despite student efforts, most notably the occupation of Eliot Hall organized by Reedies Against Racism that lasted almost two months, the committee cited Reed’s Investment Responsibility Policy, Mission Statement, and Operating Principles in defense of their decision, stating: “The Investment Responsibility Policy … reflects the college’s belief that endorsing such an agenda would stifle academic freedom by discouraging scholars and students with different views from teaching and studying at Reed.” The committee attempted to illustrate this by referring to the college’s decision to fire suspected communists during the McCarthy era in the 1950s as an example of why they choose not to support “specific political positions.” This statement is the most recent of multiple refusals of the college to divest, including Reed’s unwillingness to divest from fossil fuels in 2014 and to divest from Apartheid in South Africa in the late 1980s.

    The committee’s statement cited the specific student grievances against Wells Fargo, such as its funding of the Dakota Access Pipeline, private prisons overseen by CoreCivic and GEO Group, companies that profit from Israeli Occupation crimes, and the bank’s discriminatory lending practices. The committee responded to these directly by stating that none of these issues “violates almost universally held social or moral principles.” Students in favor of divesting would argue that, especially in the case of private prisons, protecting marginalized peoples’ lives _is_ or _should be_ a “universally held social or moral principle,” and that “academic freedom” is a privilege that should not be prioritized over “freedom” itself. There is also strong evidence that this issue _does_ pertain to “almost” universally held beliefs in the fact that the cities of Portland and Seattle have both divested from Wells Fargo, as well as the University of California school system. In addition, the Investment Committee claims divesting would force them to divert time and money away from education. However, the recently released Paradise Papers, which reveal offshore accounts and investment in EnCap suggest that a great deal of time and attention is already being spent on the college’s investment practices. 

This decision is not final and can be challenged through an appeal process with the Board of Trustees. The original statement from the Investment Committee, as well as the Mission Statement and Investment Responsibility Policy, are available on Reed’s website.
