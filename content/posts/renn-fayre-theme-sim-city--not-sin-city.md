Renn Fayre czar David James is feeling embarrassed. After overhearing a conversation in commons between two eager first years planning their devil costumes for the 2018 Renn Fayre, he realized he had made a huge mistake. On February 4 at midnight during the Glitterati Ball, James and fellow czars Brenna Intemann-Milligan, Aminta Gueye, Leensa Gheneti, and Kieran Nugent announced the theme for this year’s celebration: “Sin City.” However, after realizing the typo, the czars recently announced that the theme is supposed to be “Sim City.”

James told the _Quest_ that this was “an honest mistake.” He said, “We are sorry to anyone who has already purchased their outfits. We had imagined people might plan their costumes around the 15 possible emotions in _Sims 4_. It really gives people a range to choose from for the duration of the weekend.” 

These emotions, according to “Carl’s _Sims 4_ Guide”, are broken into positive and negative emotions. The possible positive emotions students can build their costumes around are happy, confident, energized, fine, flirty, focused, inspired, and playful, and the negative emotions available for dramatic interpretation are angry, bored, dazed, sad, embarrassed, and uncomfortable. James commented, “I was thinking people who really wanted to embody sadness could paint themselves blue or something like that.”

James also explained the rationale for this strange choice of theme, saying, “You know, sometimes Reed does feel like a simulation in which students are only capable of certain forms of social interaction and demonstrate limited emotional capacity, so we think _The Sims_ captures the essence of fun here at Reed.”

Religion professor Steve Wasserstrom approves of this analogy. “With all the new development in artificial intelligence, it makes perfect sense! I think these outstanding students are making their ways out of Plato’s cave, and I couldn’t be prouder.” Wasserstrom also admitted to playing “multiple editions” of _The Sims_ in his free time between lecturing on the _Republic_. 

Renn Fayre this year will begin on Friday, April 27. First year Lili Davis is feeling excited. “It’ll be my first college party!” she said in an interview. “With the change in theme, I’m thinking I want to dress as the emotion _dazed_. It’s the closest to my natural state, so it won’t be too much work to find something in my closet. I just love being thrifty for these things!”

Davis, like Wasserstrom, has a passion for _The Sims_. In fact, when she was applying to Reed, she wrote her essay about teaching a Paideia class on the history and evolution of _The Sims_. “Now that I’m here,” she reflected, “it makes sense why they accepted me — I fit right in!” 

James himself is planning on dressing confidently. “Now that we’ve straightened this out,” he proclaimed, “the only thing left to do is party.”
