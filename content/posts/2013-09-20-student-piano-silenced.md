The piano in the Student Union was broken. It was four thousand dollars.

With motives born out of the love students have for each other, the student body government recently bought a new piano for our shared space. Students used the SU piano everyday and in tribute, the KRRC posed with it in loving remembrance.

The night was calm this Saturday. It happened before the red skies of Portland broke into the grey light. As if an occult hand had swept away all the shadows, a diffused light covered the room in a dark matte.

&#8220;Why are you doing this?&#8221;

&#8220;Give me those pliers.&#8221;

The deed was soon finished. On the top of the opened piano, a pile of dampers lay. As the last rod of metal was cut, a sheet of paper caught the eye.

&#8220;What does it say?&#8221;

&#8220;_Dear Pianist who plays frequently in the student union, I live in Winch so I hear you play a lot. Please continue to do so, I think your music is wonderful. You are very talented._&#8221;

&#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;
