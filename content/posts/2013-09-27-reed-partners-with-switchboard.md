With a huge smile and a poofy skirt, junior Kaori Freda was a walking advertisement for Reed Switchboard (also known as the “Craigslist of Reed) at this September’s Activity Fair. Little red hearts drawn on curious students’ faces transformed the student body into the face of Switchboard.

This week, the partnership between Reed and the Switchboard was made official. Because the Parent and Alumni Relations committee is the first official paying subscriber to Switchboard, the website will always be free for the Reed community.

Officially started up in February of 2011, Switchboard has been operating as an autonomous online community that allows current students to connect with alumni and faculty. On the website, people have three options for posting: news, ask, or offer. Some posts are career-oriented, while others concern finding and receiving places to stay.

Switchboard has long been trying to gain recognition by the college, but it wasn’t until a few months ago that Director of Parent and Alumni Relations Mike Teskey approached the startup to begin discussing a partnership.

Teskey says, “We have watched Reed Switchboard grow from an idea into a functioning tool, and we look forward to seeing it grow further.”

As an officially recognized entity of the college, Switchboard will now have a more direct relationship with the Reed community, most tangibly by being allowed a presence at Reed events or having access to community email lists.

Assuring the Switchboard community that Switchboard will remain the tool they have come to love, Co-Founder and CEO of Switchboard Mara Zepeda says, “thanks to campus resources, it will be a lot more awesome.” In the next few years, Zepeda says, “We want Switchboard to become a ubiquitous verb at Reed. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re looking for a job? Switchboard it.&#8221;

When asked why she decided to create Switchboard, Zepeda says, “We created Switchboard to solve our own problem. As students at Reed, we didn&#8217;t interact with alumni very much. And we sure could have used the help. As alumni ourselves, we rarely had the chance to be of service to current students. So we built Switchboard to make connections between Reedies easier.”

Her favorite success story comes from last May, when, through a Switchboard offer, three Reedies got to sail around the Mediterranean on a forty-seven foot long sailboat (named “Scarlet”) this past summer.

Freda, the self-named “cheerleader” for Switchboard, noted her own Switchboard success story as finding a job while on her year abroad in Florence, Italy.

“Reedies really have something in common, and Switchboard is the perfect productive forum,” says Freda. She went on to say that Switchboard demonstrates Reed’s “spirit of generosity” and provides a place for olde and nü Reed to connect as a community.
