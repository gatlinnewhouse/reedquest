We’re seniors now, mostly meeting outside the library in breaks from thesis. Between mutual progress reports and various thesis grumblings, we’ve been taking stock of our experiences and remembering the last four years. Reed seems recently more vivid, now that we’re about to leave. So many instances stand out as worth sharing, in the semi-detachment of premature nostalgia, and we have a full-bodied wonder at the place itself. Reed is amazing. We’ve discussed how the education we received here was incredible; we’re also blown over with gratitude for the overall experience as it affected our lives here. On leaving, we want to express our appreciation for this unique place. Not just for the faculty—incredible teachers and academic mentors—but also for the staff here at Reed.

We’re just two, and we can’t speak for the entire student body. However, after having talked about it, we wanted to share our gratitude with the people to whom it is directed. To us, the staff here at Reed has been consistently characterized by a sincere respect for the students. This aspect of the experience of Reed has colored day-to-day life on campus, and seems to us a deep manifestation of integrity to the mission and principles of the college.  We wanted to say thank you.

To the health center, where we got cold remedies and bike-crash bandages, contraception and immunizations, and who was part of the convocation lecture series for parents. When a parent asked why they didn’t do more to “make the students stop smoking”, they replied that these are smart kids. They said, telling them not to smoke is not what we’re here for. Its nothing they don’t already know. For kids just out of high school, this was an introduction for us to adults in institutions who treated us like adults.

To the financial aid officers: what can we say? We cannot thank you enough. You made this education possible for us. Dealing with tuition and loans can be an emotional and taxing experience, and your positive, practical demeanor was fantastic. Thanks for helping us navigate the loan forms for the umpteenth time, and for being so kind to our emotional parents.

Thanks to the CSOs. We always felt that you took your mission seriously: not enforcers of punitive law, but resources for the health and safety of campus. Thanks for respecting us, because noise parade is awesome.
  
To the grounds maintenance staff—the campus and canyon are beautiful, thanks in large part to the work you do. Even after Renn Fayre, when the place is a mess, we’ve never felt that you resented our festivities. We’re so lucky to spend time in this environment every day.

There are countless others we haven’t recognized here specifically, but thank you as well. We just wanted to humbly acknowledge what seems to be a sincere goal of maintaining an atmosphere of respect and collaboration with students. We think this is rare in institutions, and part of what makes Reed truly a community. We have felt that you’ve gone out of your way for us. Thank you so much.

Sincerely,
  
Kaia Maclaren and Rosie Pine
