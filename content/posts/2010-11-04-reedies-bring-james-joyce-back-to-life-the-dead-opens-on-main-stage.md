Musicals are rare here at Reed, and musical theses are rarer still. That’s why Stephen Bennett’s thesis play, The Dead, is a must-see this semester. Based on the short story “The Dead” from James Joyce’s epic work Dubliners, The Dead tells a tale of personal enlightenment and offers deep and compelling insight into the human condition. Taking place at a Twelfth Night party set in 1904, Gabriel Conroy, nephew of the hostesses, must come to terms with the previously untold secrets and memories of his wife’s past that resurface during the holiday feast. His wife’s awakening leads to series of personal discoveries for Conroy himself, culminating in explorations of his connections to his wife, himself, and the past.

“The musical is about epiphanies. Some are big, some are small &#8211; and we all experience those as human beings,” says Darrin Pufall, costume designer and director of the musical. “It’s a great example of where literature and theater make that special collaboration.”

The project started last year when Stephen Bennet read Dubliners for the first time and was blown away by the intensity of the work.

“Dubliners was very compelling, but the last story was by far the most gripping,” says Bennett. “But even though I loved the story, I was reluctant to do a musical.”

Bennett first came to Reed wanting to do musical theater, but quickly learned that such ideas were less than realistic. “I had a lot of delusions about what could be done at Reed,” says Bennett. “It’s hard to do a musical at a very small school where the music and theater department don’t necessarily see eye-to-eye.”

Pufall seconds this statement. “It’s different from producing a play, because it’s not just blocking and narrative,” he says, which was why he decided to get as much help as possible from outside sources.

In addition to getting Professor Jay Dickson, Reed’s resident pundit on all things Joyce, to help him get a fuller understanding of the text, Pufall also recruited Theresa Koon, local acting coach, to conduct workshops for students potentially interested in being in the musical but with limited experience in this kind of production. The result was a surprising turnout at auditions. More than 40 people auditioned for eleven roles. Two faculty members are actually performing in The Dead:

Kathleen Worley and Kristeen Willis Crosser play the aunts of protagonist Gabriel Conroy. Claire Thomforde-Garner ’12, was also enlisted to choreograph and teach the traditional Irish and English dances that the musical calls for.

“The script does not follow a traditional music theater format—it’s a little more organic,” says Pufall, sharing that while songs are typically used in musicals to further plot or give character, the songs used in The Dead are meant to be drinking, patriotic, or love songs. “They need to be reassigned to fit the narrative,” says Pufall, “and they’ve done a great job.”

In addition to facing challenges with direction and training performers, Pufall also had to put a great amount of effort into building up a costume inventory for the production. “We haven’t done [a piece from this time period] in a while, so we didn’t have a lot of Edwardian stock,” says Pufall. “We’ve built almost everything from the ground up. So the costumes have a twofold role: they create dramatic presence, and they also bulk up our costume stock.” The costume shop was faced with an unusually large order of six full gowns, which was a time consuming but ultimately gratifying undertaking; the costumes are nothing short of impressive.

Taking such a demanding project definitely had its rewards. Both Pufall and Bennett enthusiastically gush about the many highlights of the experience: “Watching the students grow as artists—they surprised me every single rehearsal—I realize I’m very lucky to have the talent I have for a school that doesn’t do this on a regular basis,” says Pufall. “I’m blessed to have a cast that can just pick up the material and go.”

The Dead is a great musical overall, and it’s more than perfect for this particular audience. Says Pufall with a laugh, “It’s a very Reed College musical—what better to do than combine James Joyce and musical theater?” Good question.
