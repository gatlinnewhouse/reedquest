In Western culture, female genital mutilation is regarded as a violent act against women that is a product of patriarchal oppression. Girls who are victims of this mutilation are stripped of their agency and coerced into a ritual that destroys the possibility of sexual pleasure in the future.

AnnaLise Bender-Brown is out to deconstruct these ideas. For her anthropology thesis, which she is working on with Professor China Sherz, AnnaLise of Seattle, Washington sets out to challenge Western views of female genital cutting in Kenya. &#8220;Terminology like mutilation is loaded,&#8221; says AnnaLise, who prefers the less biased term Female Genital Cutting, or FGC. AnnaLise argues that the discourses around eradicating FGC end up giving an inaccurate picture of the agency that girls who experience FGC have. FGC has gained visibility over the past few years, and more and more NGOs have developed with the purpose of eradicating it.

The problem with this, AnnaLise says, is that Western forces disregard children&#8217;s agency in the ritual practice of FGC. AnnaLise gives the example of Kenya&#8217;s Ngaitana Movement. In the 1950s, Britain&#8217;s colonial administration in Kenya banned clitoridectomy, or the removal of the clitoris, regardless of its use in ritual. As a result, Kenyan girls as young as 8 years old started to secretly circumcise themselves, completely devoid of ceremony. &#8220;They had a desire to maintain this ritual that was considered a rite of passage,&#8221; AnnaLise says. She explains that the movement challenged the idea of patriarchal oppression as the driving force behind FGC. &#8220;These young girls clearly weren&#8217;t blindly brainwashed by patriarchal control,&#8221; though, she says, peer pressure may have played a role.

Even in a post-colonial world, the problematic imposition of Western norms on non-Westerners still exists. NGOs that attempt to eradicate FGC are typically Western and generally try to commodify girls&#8217; bodies in their &#8220;alternative rites ceremonies,&#8221; AnnaLise explains. &#8220;NGOs are desperate for bodies in their programs and treat girls as commodities. Once a program is completed, NGOs parade girls around and treat them as just their bodies,&#8221; she says.

But what if we can&#8217;t differentiate between forcible and voluntary FGC? &#8220;That&#8217;s a good question,&#8221; AnnaLise says, but it&#8217;s not the question she is setting out to answer in her thesis. &#8220;It&#8217;s just troubling to me that white, liberal Westerners think they know what&#8217;s right for the genitals of people from the Global South.&#8221; AnnaLise adds, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to largely suspend my political convictions by doing this project. We just can&#8217;t always assume that [these girls] don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;

AnnaLise believes that the perception of FGC as wrong arises mostly out of second-wave feminism, a Western phenomenon that focused on the clitoris as the site of pleasure for women. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the right to sexual pleasure that we think everyone should have,&#8221; she says. However, AnnaLise also believes that sexual norms – including sites of sexual pleasure – can be shaped by culture. We want to believe that all female bodies are the same, but evidence shows that the clitoris isn&#8217;t the only avenue to an orgasm, she says.

AnnaLise admits that embarking on her thesis isn&#8217;t easy. But, she says, &#8220;to really cultivate a meaningful feminism, for yourself, you have to be really critical of the media&#8217;s depiction of women around the world. Patriarchy and oppression aren&#8217;t the same everywhere.&#8221; Instead of homogenizing the experiences of women, AnnaLise&#8217;s post-structuralist, feminist approach will illuminate the agency of the women who have been marginalized by Western ideas of right and wrong.
