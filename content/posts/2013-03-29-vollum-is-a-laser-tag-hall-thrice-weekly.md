Campus is awash with murmurs of a Reed Fight Club, but there is already a way to engage your peers in combat. “What people don’t realize,” says Aaron McCray-Goldsmith ’14, “is that there’s a guy on campus who has 23 functional laser tag guns and wants to play all the time.” When he’s not playing laser tag all the time, Aaron brings his weapons to Vollum. From 10 p.m. to midnight on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, the building becomes a three story laser tag battle ground.

On Sunday nights, the DJ group Get Naked sets up a booth on the second floor and plays mood music during the event. Aaron compares the atmosphere to “being in the _Tron_ fight scene for 2 hours.” Jordan Jackson ’15 says, “I can’t believe it’s not war!”

G Luhman ’15 glows with pride. “I barrel-rolled over a chair.”

McCray-Goldsmith says, “It actually does get pretty goddamn intense.”

The guns, which shoot a modulated infrared beam that is not dangerous to eyes or skin, serve as the target, so no vest is necessary.

Though he founded the thrice-weekly laser tag event this semester, Aaron is already looking to the future. “I want this to be my legacy,” he explains. The group is always looking for more participants and plans to host a variety of special games as well. Laser Tag Formal: _James Bond_ is already in the works. As the weather improves, games can be moved outside. There will also be technological advances, as they hope to develop harnesses so that dogs and chickens can play, as well as making devices that act as laser tag grenades.

McCray-Goldsmith states the problem simply: “You just don’t get enough endorphins at this school.” He claims that it is a better work out than his PE classes and “definitely more fun than squash.” The physical benefits go beyond simple cardio, he says. “My reflexes are lightning fast after starting to play.” Laser tag may become a P.E. class if a steady group of students shows up this semester, expresses interest in continuing to play next year, and maintains an injury-free record.
