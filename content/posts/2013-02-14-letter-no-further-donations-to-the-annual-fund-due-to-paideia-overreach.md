I am addressing this email to the President&#8217;s office, the Development office, and _The_ _Quest_, regarding the recent report that the President&#8217;s office has overreached its mandate to censor classes at Paideia, as reported in the Daily Caller.

I will not be giving any more money to the college, and I will actively discourage my fellow alumni from doing the same, until we receive an assurance that this kind of overreach 1) has been judged to be a mistake and 2) will never be repeated.

I have had misgivings over the appointment of President Kroger, and this action serves to confirm these concerns that he will be more engaged in policing the actions of the intelligent young adults rather than concerning himself with raising the profile of the college to increase donations. Isn&#8217;t that the primary objective of the Office of the President?

I ask you, how is dictating when and where legal adults can smoke hand-rolled cigarettes, a legal activity if a stupid one, worth the time and attention of the President?  Is this somehow going to prevent a few exceptionally mentally disturbed students from taking heroin? It will merely serve to drive behavior underground and impair student safety, in the same way that it has materially damaged alumni trust in the administration. Does creating a chilling atmosphere for the free discussion of fermentation, a process which includes such controversial products as sauerkraut, somehow improve the quality of life at the school? Please outline such an argument, if you like; I can let you know, however, that I am extremely skeptical that such an argument can be cogent or convincing.

However, I know that these are just words. Let me reiterate my main point.  This is an obnoxious action on the Part of the President&#8217;s office, and it must be responded to obnoxiously. So I&#8217;m done giving you money. I may not give very much money, because I am still relatively young, but as I am often assured by Annual Funds letters, and from my own work with the Annual Fund when I was a student, alumni who give from early stages and consistently are important sources of steady-state funding.  Well, you lost this one.
