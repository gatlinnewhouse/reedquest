  <strong>Presidential Candidates</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Jenny Calvert-Warren</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I would like to be your Student Body President because I love this school. I want to have the opportunity to work my ass off in order to represent and support you. After spending the last two and a half years immersed in the Reed experience – which has involved wading through swamps of homework, singing a cappella, acting in Hum Play, serving on committees, signating for RKSK, serving as a Senator, and celebrating Renn Fayre by putting up some big fucking domes – I’m excited to take the next step. I want to give up my vote on Senate so that I can do something more for the Reed Student Body. I feel that I am qualified and prepared to facilitate meetings, participate in discussions, find solutions, and try to make sure that your voices are well represented. I want to do my best for all of you here at this wonderful college. If you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, would like to know more about my experience, or have anything else to share, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:&#x63;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x76;&#x65;&#x6a;&#x65;&#x40;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;">&#x63;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x76;&#x65;&#x6a;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;</a>. Thank you, and don’t forget to tell your friends to vote!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I’m running for Senate as well as President because, although the executive position is the capacity in which I most hope to serve you, I still want to be an integral part of our Student Body government even if not elected as President.

  <strong>Jeffrey Poon</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  My name is Jeffrey Poon, and I am running for President.  I am currently a second-year at Reed College and served a quarter last year as a Student Senator. I regularly attend Student Senate Meetings and I have attended multiple leadership conferences and meetings, including the Northwest Student Leadership Conference and Leadership and Involvement Series sponsored by the Student Activities Office here on campus.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In addition, I am actively involved in many Reed Student Organizations and attend numerous events on campus, allowing me to communicate with students from all over Reed College.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  If I am elected, I plan to increase participation in student government, actively work to increase student autonomy, improve transparency of student government processes, increase the efficiency of the student government, and streamline transfer of knowledge to students.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <em>Note: Jeffrey Poon is also running as a Student Senator</em>

  HELLO KOMRADES! I’m running for president and you should all vote for me. I like bullet points more than huge paragraphs SO here’s why I’m qualified:
</p>

  * I have buckets of institutional memory – I’ve been to practically every senate meeting since Fall 2008, and I was a student senator in Fall 2009.
  * I’m super involved around campus – I’m a second year HA, one of the captains of the women’s rugby team, and I’m an MRC intern.
  * I’m a solid leader – I’m good at running dorm meetings and giving directions on the rugby pitch.
  
    I have good relations with staff and administrators – Kyle Webster let me redecorate his office.
  * I’m really good at time-management – My planner is color-coded.
  * I know how to mediate conflict – Between dealing with a duck in the dorms and Tuesday Talks in the MRC, I’ve had a lot of exposure to mediation of tough conversations.
  * I know how to manage being both assertive and approachable – I won’t be pushed around, but I’m also constantly seeking feedback and constructive criticism.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Additionally:
</p>

  * I still know all the words to “Hey Ma” by Cam’ron.
  * The ginger race is known for being resilient and fiery.
  * I have 20/13 vision, which makes me borderline superhero.
  * I know how to whip my hair.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I view the role of SB prez as more of a mediator and facilitator than a representative – I think the job is more about making sure that the people who the student body elected to represent them are efficient and effective. I’m all about efficiency and efficacy, and I promise that I would work super hard to make senate so good.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Come to elections assembly and ask me questions! Or email me (<a href="mailto:noramcjo@reed">noramcjo@reed</a>) and ask me questions! Or stop me on campus and ask me questions! Or add my BBM PIN (30AE8300) and BBM me questions!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As a closing remark, my presidency would be a lot like this:<a href="http://tinyurl.com/NORA4PREZ "> http://tinyurl.com/NORA4PREZ </a>

  <strong>Vice-Presidential Candidate</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>William Wood Gester</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It’s simple really. I want to continue making Reed a fucking awesome place and I think that being the Vice President would give me a good set of tools to do so. The VP has the roles and duties of a normal senator. In that capacity I would like to bring to the table the dog policy and the AOD implementation plan. I think that the impacts of the implementation plan (including the dog leash law) need to be made clear to the student body so that we can effectively respond and provide a critique. We have an opportunity to provide input now and we should do so before we lose that chance. The VP also has the unique opportunity to facilitate community interaction through the management and distribution of your student body funds to various groups on campus. It would be my job to ensure that you have money for that crazy, ridiculous and amazing human hamster wheel; that Renn Fayre has enough money for all of its awesomeness; and that you get your spicy wings. I have gained experience navigating the financial end of the student body through my signating of Brewers Guild and my interactions with funding circus, finance committee, and C-money as a signator. I stepped in to signating a little blind with little help from the previous signator and feel that I brought a lot of awesomeness (with help of course) to the campus with the Guild (which got 12th in funding poll so fuck yeah people!). This experience coupled with my desire to help you bring really amazing things to campus makes me the perfect candidate for the job. I will work tirelessly to make your experience at Reed a better place through my job as the great enabler.

  <strong>Blue Heron’s Referendum Regarding Gender Neutral Bathrooms</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <em>A note about referendums: referendums are generally regarded as nonbinding in letter but senate will take the spirit of the referendum to heart. The results of a referendum will significantly influence senate’s decision and action on the matter at hand.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I, the undersigned, support having gender neutral restrooms in public buildings at Reed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Reed community members and visitors may feel uncomfortable or unsafe using male/female restrooms due to their self-identified or perceived gender. Buildings with exclusively gender-segregated restrooms also pose problems for individuals who require the assistance of a helper if that person identifies or is perceived as a different gender. Schools such as Sarah Lawrence, Tufts, Emerson, and the University of Chicago have all moved towards creating gender neutral restrooms, and we hope that Reed, with its history of having gender neutral restrooms both in dorms and in public spaces, will follow this trend by ensuring that everyone can use the restroom no matter what building they happen to be in or what their gender identity is.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I support changing one restroom in every building with multiple restrooms to gender neutral, and having the community and relevant academic department decide on the status of the restrooms in buildings with a single restroom (Psych and Theater). We feel that changing the signs on a restroom in every building will help create a safer, more inclusive community for everyone.

  <strong>Senatorial Candidates</strong>
</p>

**AnnaLise Bender-Brown**

Oh hey, Reed College Student Body. My name is AnnaLise Bender-Brown and I want to be your Senator. With a new year, new policies, and a wholly different vibe at Reed, I, like many others, have found myself disillusioned with the loss of those ineffably warm-and-fuzzy feelings that pervade one’s first year here. I’m ready to change that. I want to restore my love for the place we’re lucky enough to call a second home. I want to get involved in the Reed community, a community of mindful individuals who are not only capable of self-government but who understand how precious it is and work to preserve it. The many changes that have occurred in our community this year are going to require a change in our collective attitudes about it and how we navigate our relationship with the Real World. Elect me to Senate and let me be a liaison for y’all Reedies whom I know and love.

**Jacob Canter**

Hello Reed College! My name is Jacob Canter and I would love to be one of your student body Senators. I’m new to Reed, but I have lots of experience working with an administration and a student body from a position of leadership and I have a real interest and passion in student affairs and progress. Over the next several years, the four major goals Senate has stated it plans on working on are (1) protecting the independence of the student body; (2) strengthening the relationship with the administration; (3) improving transparency of the student Senate; and (4) reducing student apathy towards student government. These are smart, important and reasonable goals I believe I can support and address immediately as part of student Senate, both through my unique and new perspective on the issues but also though my experience in knowing the amount of work it takes, both individually and with the community, to complete tasks and fulfill goals in a student government setting. I want to work with Reed College and the student Senate to make these objectives become realities, while still every day supporting the honor principle and all the students who look towards their Senate for assistance. I have already loved what I have seen in the Reed community since I first arrived here in August, and now I hope to support this great college and continue moving it in the right direction.

**Aidan Sigman**

Hailing from the gusty shores of Lake Michigan, Aidan spent several years voyaging about the Great American Empire before casting anchor at Reed. He started by heading east to Gotham where he learned the minds of those at New York University. Not satisfied with this perspective, he made his way to the Left Coast and worked as a barista for two years (NYU had left its financial mark on the man). It was this exposure to the blue-collar life that rekindled his commitment to learning and inspired his return to higher education at Reed this year.

Aidan has always been interested in school politics and spent his time at NYU working towards budget disclosure and better financial aid. He has attended Senate meetings at Reed as an audience member and enjoys the spirited discussions that often arise. Having observed some of the issues caused by confusion over the Senators’ status as student representatives, Aidan would like to play an active part in defining this role and the extent of the Senators’ powers. He believes a concrete understanding of the Senators’ jobs is essential to maintaining an effective and useful student government.

**David Azrael**

I am competent and work pretty hard. Right now the game’s the same, it’s just got more fierce. You know thing about the old days: they’re the old days. Sometimes you want it to be one way, but its the other way. So thats why I have to be fierce, show some flex, but give and take on both sides. But first I have to crawl, walk and then run. Right now I all have is my word and my reputation, with that alone I believe I have a line to senate. But I guess thats not enough, because not everything comes down to how you carry yourself. So when it comes time to vote, vote for competency and fierce advocate on your behalf.

**Martha Janicki**

Within just my first semester at Reed,  I have become the Senate Secretary, a Humanities 110 morning greeter, a member of Student Committee on Academic Planning and Policy, and a contributor to the Quest;  I have attended every Senate meeting since my arrival. With these activities I have asserted my love for the job I would performing as a Senator. With positions as Secretary and Quest writer, I have already established relations with administration and current student representatives, giving me the behind-the-scenes knowledge necessary in making informed decisions. I am sure that I am ready to become an active member of our student government.  The student body primarily needs somebody to do their job;  I promise to keep on working my ass off with any committees or organizations I will be involved with. The students’ voices should be heard and I will govern my decisions with impartiality and rational judgment necessary in defending what is best for the student body I represent. You don’t need the empty promises from other candidates. You need someone to keep Senate going and I promise to keep on doing that.

If you would like to find out anything else about what I stand for, my reasons for running or anything other questions you may have, I would love talk. Come up to chat or contact me by email at [&#x6d;&#x6a;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x69;&#x63;&#x6b;&#x69;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1].

**Meg Millhouse**

Meg Millhouse has the ferocity of eight tigers. Meg Millhouse will get men to Mars in the next ten years. Meg Millhouse will explain fucking magnets &#8211; how they work. Meg Millhouse will defeat Voldemort. Meg Millhouse will save the rainforest. Meg Millhouse will bring back Arrested Development.

But seriously, I’ve been on Quest Board, I’ve election czar-ed, and I am a (mostly) regular attendee of Senate meetings, so I’m generally familiar with the workings of Senate.  I am good at getting shit done. I don’t have an issue-specific platform or a certain agenda I’m trying to push. All I can say is that I care about the general well-being of Reed College. But feel free to ask me any questions about my opinions on issues that are important to you.

**Abraham Leiser**

Why vote for a freshman?  I love it here.  After my first ten minutes at Reed, I felt like I’d finally come home.  I still feel that way.  I’ve got a lot of time left here, and I want to make sure that Reed is just as amazing when I leave as it was when I got here.  That is why I’m running for Senate.  I might not have been to Renn Fayre yet, and I still get destroyed in the pool hall, but I’ve done everything a Senator needs to do.  I was vice-president of my high school’s biggest club, which had more than two hundred members.  I learned how to work out disagreements with the administration, how to share my ideas without being “that guy,” how to solve problems, and how to actually get shit done.  I take the responsibility of representing whole Student Body seriously, and I think that I can do a good job.  If you want to talk to me about your questions, your thoughts, or whatever, you can email me at [&#x61;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x69;&#x73;&#x65;&#x72;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][2] or spot me by my hair.  Thank you, and please vote!

**Greeni Sullivan**

Because I am a freshman, I don’t know too much about being a Reedie yet. I’ll admit it. I’ve never celebrated Renn Fayre, taken a qual, or worked on my thesis. But, because I am a freshman, I am not jaded, and I have enough time to do this.

Though I am new here, I am a mailroom clerk and a fledgling member of Queer Alliance, Weapons of Mass Distraction, and RKSK. Not only can I be the voice for the younger folks at Reed, I can draw insight from my high school positions, particularly Vice-President of our Gay-Straight Alliance and a member of STAND (Students Together Advocating Nonviolence and Diversity). I can use my organizational and financial experience from co-creating an annual summer camp that has survived since elementary school. (Said awesome camp has gone to numerous state parks, Philadelphia, Cape Cod, and Vancouver, BC.)

Because I am a freshman, I am still young, still “bright eyed and bushy tailed,” and I am eager to use that energy for the benefit of the Reed community. As a senator, I will listen to your issues and work as hard as I can. Please give me a chance to get involved and make a difference, melors.

  <strong>Quest Boards</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Wild Wild Quest 2.0</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We Quediors three – En-Szu Hu-Van Wright, Andrew Choi, and Johnny Flores – have decided to run for Quest Board again. While we’re losing Ethan Knudson and Katy Joseph to thesis hell, we are pleased to announce that our web guru, Lucy Butcher, will be running with us. This semester, we have kept you informed and entertained. We took the Quest online and put Kyle Webster on the masthead; and we want to do it all again. There’s no knowing where Andrew might superimpose Johnny’s face next, or which subgenres are waiting to be unearthed by En-Szu.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Pug love,<br /> Your Queditors
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Nina Showell, editor in chief</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We?re going to write the Quest. Yeah, that?s me and 1,300 of my  closest friends. Why? Because the Quest needs to be a newspaper that?s  of the people, by the people, and for the people. The Quest isn?t a  ?real? newspaper. It never will be. That?s simply not the role that it  plays in this community.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Quest shouldn?t be the edited, censored, sanitized, and boring  crap that other ?real? school newspapers put out. It really shouldn?t  be online at all. It should be a paper that pushes boundaries, a paper  that holds in itself passionate editorials and real debates. The quest  isn?t designed to go outside the bubble (and its content is irrelevant  to those who read it if it does?non-reedies just don?t understand  reed). While the various scandals from the past were and always will  be pretty terrible, discussions about these contentious topics are  what the Quest is here for. The paper obviously shouldn?t be a tabloid, but being plain vanilla is a whole lot worse.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Quest is here to challenge notions about our community, the honor principle, and the values that this very institution stands for. Its function is to express the news and views of this community (and its  goal should be to better explore these viewpoints). Think about the  very name of the f&#8212;ing paper!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I would like to graciously invite you to join me, because what we are about to embark on is truly a QUEST, and it?s going to be a pretty rad  one at that. Come join in on the adventure!
</p>
