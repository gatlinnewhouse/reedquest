The visuals, an amalgam of movie and television clips and _Tim and Eric_-esque psychedelic imagery, were well-done; the group was enthusiastic and a master of their medium; the beats were pumping; and the crowd was totally into it. Das Racist pranced around the stage as a mob of students oscillated before them. But Kaul was, well, Kaul: sterile, vacuous, and more suggestive of the pep-rally scene in _Heathers_ than of an actual auditorium.

The remarkably poor quality of sound in Kaul on Friday night made Das Racist’s intentionally perplexing lyrics even harder to comprehend. “It’s hard to understand when they’re rapping!” a student said, her voice amplified over the lyrical chaos when handed a microphone. Das Racist then threw bits of shredded newspapers into the crowd like confetti, and Reedies trampled the tattered artifacts of mainstream culture to the beat.

Das Racist, composed of artists Heems, Kool A.D., and Dap, lambastes society and satirizes hip-hop and rap through their skillful—and catchy—use of the art-form. However, because they steep their commentary in sarcasm and wittily preempt all criticism of their methods, it can be hard to tell when they are serious.

Halfway through the performance, the group took what one student called “the fuck-it approach,” and the stage was soon full of dancing Reedies. Several excited students seized the opportunity and succeeded in crowd-surfing for a full fifteen seconds. Das Racist themselves were nearly crowded off the stage, but they reveled in the energy of the audience. Whether the situation grew into an expression of hip-hop and rap culture, a Das Racist parody of hip-hop and rap culture, or a Das Racist meta-parody of a Das Racist parody of hip-hop and rap culture, was unclear.

The poor choice of venue aside, Friday night was a once-in-a-lifetime chance for fans to experience Das Racist in extreme intimacy. Their lyrics are intelligent, and their music is prime. They represent one of the richest cultural phenomena of the twenty-first century thus far, and their new album, _Relax_, came out on Tuesday. You feel me? Holler.
