Are you using the Gray Fund honorably?

The Gray Fund is well loved for its weekly recreation trips, which help Reedies break the bubble and get off campus. They feed them well, treat them royally, and provide a weekly opportunity for fun. Gray Fund can teach you how to climb, ski, and windsurf—all for free.

Most Reedies would say that Gray Fund is an awesome part of Reed—even if they don’t participate in it. Not all Reedies, however, seem to realize that it must be treated honorably. The Fund&#8217;s money is finite: It is an endowed fund, and we’re spending it bit by bit each year. As this year’s GF recreation intern, I manage and oversee the lottery process. Despite the lotteries having a high number of ballots each Tuesday, there are on average at least two no-shows on the morning of the trip. Sometimes hopeful alternates take these spots; sometimes, however, the spot isn’t filled and the money is wasted. For high-end excursions such as the ever-popular Hot Air Balloon trip, the wasted money can amount to over $300 per head.

While I do, occasionally, receive legitimate last-minute excuses from no-shows, the vast majority remains silent. Many GF trips leave the vans at 7:00 a.m. Saturday morning. I think nothing needs to be said about the myriad of morning-killers a good Friday night can provide.

Remember that the Honor Principle extends to all aspects of Reed. This may mean holding off on a shot or two because you know you’ve committed to be somewhere in the morning. This means recognizing that there are a lot of privileges and perks that come with being a Reed student. In the real world, a day at Mt. Hood’s Meadows can cost over $100, private climbing lessons over $200. A Gray-Fund-quality breakfast, lunch, and dinner, easily tops my weekly Safeway bill.

Gray Fund may be your last chance to be coddled and cosseted on an awesome trip for free. In the midst of the semester, this place can seem like a cold, rainy hell of nothing but work. Just remember that there are opportunities year-round that can make even the most curmudgeoned love Reed.
