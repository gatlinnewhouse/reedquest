    The Paradox Café.

</div>

One of the places where Reed students get their daily dose of caffeine, the Paradox Café embodies the sort of ethic and energy that defines the Reed experience. The art on the walls is student made (and for sale), pastries are on many occasions made by Reed students, and drip coffee is sold via honor principle.

In essence, the Paradox is a Reed establishment, both sustained by the school and contributing to it.

However, over the past several years the Paradox has been taking steps that, whether they realize it or not, work to its becoming an independent, self-sufficient and legitimate business that can, and maybe in the future will, survive without Reed’s care.

Two years ago, however, the Paradox was hardly at institution it is now. In an article published February 3, 2010, Katy Joseph described the Paradox as just getting out of financial woes after falling $9,000 under its minimum bank balance.

“We were undercharging the whole school and the managers didn’t know how to manage very well,” says Jackson Smith, a current Paradox barista who has been working at there for nearly two years.

In the article, Sam Geller (the current financial manger of the Paradox) joked that they were finally “back in the black”, but the reality of the situation was that the Paradox still had very little autonomy as a business.

According to Geller, the agreement the Paradox has with Student Senate is that it does not have to pay rent (a huge financial factor for most businesses) and its only costs are supplies and paychecks.

Dave Toffey, Geller’s predecessor, mentioned in last year’s article that the former managers practice of “[writing] down totals by hand in the margins and then [going] to the bank,” allowed “broad oversight[s] for the business to disappear” and failed to follow the Paradox bylaws by not submitting a quarterly financial report to Student Senate.

Since then, the managers have made many small (and some large) changes that have led the Paradox in the right direction and have begun to give it the autonomy it was previously lacking.

Most notably, they have gotten their financial reports electronically organized and have raised the prices on all their products. By donating 40 percent of their profit to the SU at the start of every year, the Paradox managers have started trying to compensate the SU for the free rent. Furthermore, they follow the Paradox bylaws more thoroughly and are doing a commendable job of not only working with the staff and keeping the Paradox a chic, friendly destination, but with expanding the opportunities for the coffeeshop, as well.

These opportunities include working closely with Beth Martin, Director of Conferences and Events Planning (CEP) here at Reed. One of Martin’s responsibilities is to prepare Reed for the summer, when students are not here but the campus is still active with conferences, summer camps, and different organizations. Beth schedules their appointments and sees what she can do to make their stay here as pleasant as possible, and one of the greatest desires of these different groups of people is good, hot coffee.

“The other option,” Martin says, “is to have a coffee cart brought in for the summer, and that coffee really isn’t that good. That’s why we ask the Paradox to stay open.” This previous summer was not the first time the Paradox has stayed open. However, the attitude of the employees working there over the summer, and the work the managers at the Paradox are doing with the CEP, shows that the Paradox is moving towards legitimacy.

“[The] Paradox is pretty relaxed usually compared to other cafés I’ve worked at,” Smith noted, “but [when] the Tinhouse Writers Workshop [was here over the summer] it was pretty busy, with lines going out the doors.” Not only did the busy times at the Paradox feel more “real” to Jackson though, but the slow times felt that way as well: “Over the summer the Paradox definitely wasn’t just like a clubhouse being open for ourselves [the baristas]. That was definitely not the case. It really was in fact more like a real job over the summer than it is during the school year [when all your friends are around] because you’re in the coffee shop just sitting alone serving people”.

And the sitting alone occurred quite often. Even if a few of the conferences produced long, busy lines for the Paradox, most of the events over the summer did not require coffee and through both lack of business and outstanding bills the Paradox actually lost around $6000 in the process.

This amount, however significant it looks, is in fact not a major concern to the Paradox managers, who have the coffeeshop currently at $16,000 above the minimum bank account requirement. They believe that losing the money was, in a way, a kind gesture to the CEP to ensure future relationships with them. “We can take a hit,” Sam says, “to show good faith that later they’ll [the CEP] later help us out”.

The Paradox’s decision worked out, and they are currently scheduled to be open for next summer’s activities as well, with a chance that they will either be compensated for any losses that are procured during that time or, as per Smith’s suggestion, they will “be more selective in choosing which conferences to stay open for because some of them definitely bring in a lot of customers and some of them don’t.”

Business dealings? Proper bookkeeping? Taking losses to ensure future gains? All this evidence points to a business that not only sees itself as legitimate, but wants to become independent and prosperous—a stark difference from what was seen out of the Paradox less than two years ago.

Now, it’s obvious that the Paradox isn’t planning on seceding from Reed, but it is interesting how it has decided more recently to take ownership over its own issues and has chosen to become more self-sufficient, letting it do its work as a coffeshop, and letting Reed just enjoy the shop’s pleasures when it pleases. Whether the shop can continue to survive this way is unclear, but what is certainly clear is that with the Paradox running smoothly, there was never a better time to get a nice, hot drink.
