Reed’s ski cabin in Government Camp will open its doors for reservations on Friday October 15 after undergoing a significant remodel.

The cabin’s renovation, intended to increase long-term functionality, was provided for by a generous alumni gift. Among other considerations, the plumbing was in need of updating, the bathrooms were in structural disrepair, and there were significant problems with wiring in the sauna.

To reserve a bed in the cabin you must sign up via your IRIS account; absolutely NO drop-in overnight visits are allowed.

The cabin has a live-in manager named Eric Kallio; as this is his primary residence it is essential that all visitors treat the space with respect and accountability. Eric’s job is to ensure the safety and security of the facility and users visiting by enforcing the governing policies and procedures.

The current fire code limit of occupancy is 14 plus the live-in manager. This rule is strictly enforced.

Reed Ski Cabin offers a tranquil escape from the bustling city and tribulations that come with academics at Reed College.

The cabin will officially be open for Fall Break 2010 with the reservations system opening on IRIS, Thursday October 7th, 2010.

Please e-mail, call, or drop by my office if you have any questions regarding the newly remodeled ski cabin and it’s operations.
