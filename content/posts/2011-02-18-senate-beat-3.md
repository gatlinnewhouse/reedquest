Valentines Day with Senate was extra special. The lights were dimmed and each member had a flower by them. It was super romantic. I was definitely feeling the love. Until they announced the funding results, that is.

Senate spent all weekend locked in Vollum 120 going over Top 40 budgets, the results of which were announced at this meeting. Lots of great groups got cash, some great groups didn’t. Motorized Couch Kollective was zero funded because they didn’t have a solid plan of action – but fret not! They can come back to Finance Committee to secure funds when they have a more solidified plan (engineering majors, get on this). Also zero funded was Fire on the Quad. Senate assured us they can secure funding from Finance Committee, but I for one am unsure as to why they weren’t just funded in Top 40&#8230;? You should be outraged&#8230;outraged! DOTU and Bagels n Schmear got donut because they had $hitton$ in rollover.

Moving on! Committee Reports!

Mz. Millhouse talked to Dax “The Situation” King about churros and plates and stealing. I was late to the meeting so I’m not sure exactly what about, but I think it can be summarized as “Please don’t steal plates of churros.” Or maybe it was “I’ll beat you with a churro if you steal plates.”
  
Appointments Committee appointed Dylan Jordan and Megan Jones to J-Board and Dorothy Howard to Appeals Board. Wooh! Congrats guys! Also, you should apply to Diversity Committee and PPR Assistant Manager and Nitrogen Day Czar.

Reed’s tuition exchange was brought up at the Faculty Meeting this week. Apparently there are five or so schools in the PacNW that give faculty members free tuition at other schools. Whitman might be pulling out of the program (ha, pulling out) and Reed might do so too since Whitman is the only place Reed faculty kids go to that is in the consortium. They also talked about the growing freshman class size’s effect on Hum conference sizes. Talk to Aidan if you want more info.

Aidan also met with Conference and Events Planning for a whole hour. What came out of that meeting? “Don’t have a naked slip ‘n slide on the west lawn over Renn Fayre because it’s mother’s day weekend [and all the mommies will be parking in the west lot to take their cherubs to the Rhodie Garden for tea and crumpets].”

JCDubs talked about Theme Dorm apps with Res Life. Sounds like there are some cool places in the works like P.I.G. Dorm: People Ingesting Gourmet.

Honor Council is working on putting together a Reed Union about the honor principle with some highly controversial title like “Is The Honor Principle killing Olde Reed?” or something. Should be a good fight.

GaronT talked about talking to Renn Fayre about trees. And then he found $5.

This was new Senator David Azrael’s first meeting. He wore plaid and looked fresh and clean. He is now on SCAPP, the BPR liaison, and the Phys Plant liaison (maybe, there’s a cage fight scheduled for tonight at 6:30pm in Vollum 120 to determine whether Azrael will wrangle the position from Schwartz, winner take all).

Senate suspended the Sustainability Line Item because it wasn’t being used. This is just for this semester, however. In the mean time, if anyone has a plan for how to actually use it, Sustainability Committee is still sitting on almost all of the money that Senate has poured into it the last three semesters (about $12k). Questions on this can be directed to Senator Calvert-Warren.

Shortest meeting evarrr!! Ended just in time for you to go out for a romantic Valentines Day dinner with your Honey Bunny. Or sit in bed with a box of chocolates, some tissues, and a bottle of bourbon.
