The idea of the ‘outing club’ at the American university has a venerable history, dating to nearly the foundation of Reed itself. By some accounts, its genesis was the foundation of the very first outing club at Dartmouth College in the winter of 1909, by a rebellious Vermonter who was not content to spend the winter cooped up in parlors playing cards when he had “skeeing on the brain” [sic]. Reed, with its East Coast ambitions and West Coast iconoclasm, would naturally need an outing club of its own, one suited both to Oregon’s unique natural character and to its student body. For those Reedies with “skeeing” (or hiking or climbing or gamboling) on their overtaxed and artificially stimulated brains, Reed Outdoor Programs and Education was born. ROPE, as the program is colloquially known, encompasses a number of services you’ve probably come to take for granted, or perhaps were unaware of. In either case, they deserve your attention.

First and foremost under the ROPE umbrella, the Reed Outing Club itself is part social club, part coalition of like-minded wanderers, and part guiding service. ROC (ROPE traffics in acronyms) offers student-led trips of varying length and discipline and difficulty, across much of the great American West. ROC’s strength is derived from the dedication of its members, and it is entirely what you (the collective student body) make it. If you have an idea for a trip, act on it. In all likelihood, ROC will be able to make it happen, with either you or another student leader at the helm. Beyond providing trips, ROC hosts interesting speakers, shows movies, and holds social events, all of which feature free food. In a similar vein, the Gray Fund draws from a generously endowed fund to offer frequent recreational trips, typically of a more polished nature. ROPE also shapes many freshmen’s first experience of the Reed community (and of the Northwest) through its Outdoor Orientation Odysseys.

ROC has a physical presence on campus at the Backpack Co-op. Not to be confused with its more popular neighbor, the Bike Co-op, the Backpack Co-op is a great equalizing force in keeping with Reed’s original egalitarian spirit. Here, in the basement of Ladd, any student or staff or faculty member can borrow, for two week’s duration and completely free of charge, a vast range of outdoor equipment enabling them to reach the back of beyond, or meet their muse, or live deliberately on weekends. The Backpack Co-op also offers free ski or snowboard tune-ups (edging and waxing), has an extensive library of books ranging from field guides to technical wilderness medical literature, and serves as a headquarters of sorts for planning trips and for other ROC events. This year, the Co-op is open from 6-8 PM Monday through Thursday, and 2-4 PM on Friday.

Finally, in these dark days of recession and dire economic forecasts, it would be a poor college program indeed that did not attempt to mitigate the inherent uselessness of a liberal arts degree, and, with this in mind, ROPE offers a variety of subsidized certifications befitting the well-rounded outdoors professional. During Paideia, the popular Wilderness First Responder certification course offers students the chance to gain a valuable arsenal of eminently practical (and employable) outdoors first-aid skills. This year, ROPE will also be subsidizing Swiftwater Rescue and Avalanche Level 1 courses, both invaluable skill sets for students interested in pursuing guiding or other outdoors professions.

In order to remain relevant, ROPE demands participation. Get involved! It’s as simple as walking into the Backpack Co-op and introducing yourself, shooting an email to the ROClist ([&#x72;&#x6f;&#x63;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1]), or visiting program director Will Symms in his sports center office. We’ll see you in the woods.
