Last semester, Reed hosted a Union to address climate change and issues of sustainability on campus. Hosted by two new assistant professors and two off campus guests, the moral question of Reed&#8217;s contribution to environmental destruction was brushed off. Many felt that the Union was a diversion of attention from the &#8220;specific relevance to the Reed community&#8221; that Reed Unions are instituted to consider.

Reed&#8217;s attempts to become sustainable have been dubious. In 2009 the oldest community garden in Portland was bulldozed and paved over to build the Grove dorms. These dorms are LEED-certified and are one of the college&#8217;s starring achievements in environmental design. Like the Union on Sustainability, they are an exercise in hypocrisy.

As students, we are pouring immense sums of our time and money into Reed in order to invest in our future. And we wonder: Why is that money directly funding an industry whose profits drive climate change, threatening our future?

As Reedies, we are passionate about inquiry and critical thinking. We are passionate about civic leadership. So we wonder again: With the looming specter of global environmental catastrophe, why does Reed have such a hard time addressing its contributions to climate change? Why does Reed lag years behind its peer institutions in addressing sustainability on campus?

In dropping the banner from the roof of the Performing Arts Building during community day, we hoped we could bring these issues to mind for the administrators, students, alumni, and community members ambling around campus. **We want to generate a real community discussion around divesting the college endowment from fossil fuels.**

Previous discussions between students and the administration have yielded little. Treasurer Ed McFarlane has detailed the intrinsic difficulties of divesting an endowment that is handled between dozens of independent managers, each with their own diversified portfolio. We wonder whether we have, by our endowment&#8217;s structure, relinquished the very possibility of honorable conduct in financing our school.

The college&#8217;s Investment Responsibility Policy requires moral and social objections to investment to be widely-held or universal in order to be considered. Many of us feel that in this instance, we are morally obligated and bound by honor to reclaim our agency in our investment policy and abstain from financing the extraction of fossil fuels. In order to hold ourselves accountable, I believe a community wide discussion on this topic is in order.
