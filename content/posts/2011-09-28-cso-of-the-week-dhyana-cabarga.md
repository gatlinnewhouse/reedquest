Community Safety Officer

_Day Shift_

&nbsp;

_Why did you become a CSO?_ 

After doing all my work-study with the Community Safety Department I had forgotten how to forage in the wild, having become so acclimated to CSOs my survival was dependent on them.

&nbsp;

_Where is your hometown?_

Chapel Hill, NC.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite food?_

Sushi.

&nbsp;

_Have any hobbies?_

Volunteering at Belmont branch of the Multnomah County Public Library.

&nbsp;

_What is your spirit animal?_

Hyena.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite book?_

Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett.

&nbsp;

_What are you rocking out to in the CSO-mobile?_

Motorhead, Turbonegro, MC Chris, or whatever Pawl’s playing.

&nbsp;

_Who is your celebrity crush? _

Danny Trejo.

&nbsp;

_A freak accident has endowed you with special powers, making you into a super-CSO. What would your super power be?_

A sixth sense indicating when/where bike thieves were on campus.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite thing about your job?_ 

All of the creative problem solving opportunities.

&nbsp;

_What is your least favorite thing about your job?_

Problems I can’t solve.

&nbsp;

_What is the funniest story that you can legally tell us/tell us without being fired about being a CSO?_ 

Back when I was doing my work-study with Community Safety we got a call about someone masturbating in the pool hall. He was very spacey, and going about things in a totally non-goal oriented way. When told that he needed to stop, and that he was being trespassed, he responded with “I just want to feel nice.” We ended up calling in the Portland Police because he wouldn’t comply with our requests and no one wanted to touch him (open sores). The Portland Police didn’t want to touch him either, and after determining it would be not-so-ethical to tase him, they ended up pulling him off the couch by his pants, zipping him up, cuffing him, and taking him downtown.

&nbsp;

_Obviously being a CSO is the best job ever, but if you weren&#8217;t a CSO, what would you like to do?_

Action Librarian.

&nbsp;

_Anything else you&#8217;d like to tell us?_

I like kitties.
