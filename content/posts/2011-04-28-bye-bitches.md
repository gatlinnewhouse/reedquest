Being a Quest editor can totally suck sometimes.

Being a Quest editor can totally rock sometimes.

This past year we’ve had our fair share of ups and downs, and after our first semester we lost our mom and dad to thesis hell. It was really rough. On our shaky novice legs we wobbled though the first few weeks before starting to build our stride as a lone band of three. Production nights, which used to run till 2 AM on a bad night, began to typically end at 4 or 5. Cher O’Clock, previously reserved for 1 AM, was moved up to 11 PM and made a reappearance at 3. Early morning babysitting shifts and classes became dreaded torture. Xandra Klotz became our unofficial den mother (and my personal savior), holding our hands as we banged our heads on keyboards and cried out in anguish during those late hours spent holed up in the basement cave we called our office.

“I don’t know why you’re doing this,” my friends would say, shaking their heads. “You’re crazy.”

And maybe that’s true. No, I’m not going to miss being obscenely sleep deprived. I’m not going to miss being shat upon by the student body on a regular basis, either. I certainly won’t miss how bone-tired I felt Wednesdays and Thursdays, that sinking feeling that followed content falling through at the last minute, or spending most of my week with “Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves” stuck in my head.

But I think I’m going to miss our Tuesday nights. I know all the lyrics to all of Cher’s greatest hits by heart now (and most of RuPaul’s, too), and now I have a mental library of songs to sing in the shower. My body’s physical tolerance for excessive amounts of caffiene, junk food and lack of sleep has gone through the roof. I feel kind of like Wonder Woman. And we always had fun. There was always laughter in GCC 033 on Tuesday nights. Each week as we sent out our pdf files to Oregon Litho to print while we blasted “One More Alejandro”, that awesome Lady Gaga/Daft Punk mashup jam, I was flooded with a comforting sense of relief and pride. I think we all were.

This past semester could have been the absolute pits, but in the end it was alright because the suck factor was balanced out by the fact that I had two fanstic people to share the experience with. Who knows? Maybe someday soon we’ll get to do this together again. Until then, I will happily spend my Tuesday nights cozied up in bed at a reasonable hour, glass of weeknight wine in hand as I watch Law & Order: SVU, offering a toast to all the memories good, bad, and Cher-tacular. TTFN, biddies. It’s been real.
