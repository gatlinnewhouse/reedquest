The notorious Doomsday Clock has been pushed another thirty seconds closer to Armageddon. Concerned by the escalation of nuclear rhetoric in the White House and internationally, as well as continued governmental inaction regarding the dangers of climate change, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists elected on January 25 to move the hands of the clock to 11:58:00 from their previous position at 11:57:30. “We are very concerned,” said Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin, “with the unpredictability of the United States and how it’s thinking of its nuclear weapons.” The clock was created in 1945 at the beginning of the Cold War, serving as a symbolic weathervane for the world’s vulnerability to potential catastrophe at the hands of nuclear war, climate change, and other global threats. This latest move puts us the closest to complete destruction we have been since the 1953 testing of the hydrogen bomb.
