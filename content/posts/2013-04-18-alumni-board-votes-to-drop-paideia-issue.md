The Alumni Board voted on Saturday, April 13 to not pursue further action regarding President Kroger’s canceling several Paideia classes in January. Alumni Board President Chantal Sudbrack ’97 says that “the motion had roughly 75 percent support for no further consideration as a body.”

The Board first discussed the Paideia controversy during their February 2 meeting, six days before the community forum on the issue held in the Student Union. According to Sudbrack, President Kroger fielded questions over the phone over the next month and met with the Board on March 2. “Many questions were tough, and put President Kroger in the hot seat, despite that, we ended the meeting cordially,” Sudbrack says. After the March 2 meeting, 59 percent of the Alumni Board said that no further action should be taken.

Vice President of the Alumni Board Greg Byshenk ’89 says that the impact of the most recent decision is hard to measure. “It is difficult to gauge the gravity in any precise way. It is plain that there are some alumni (and AB members) who are very dissatisfied with President Kroger&#8217;s actions around Paideia 2013 and following. There are also others who endorse Kroger&#8217;s actions, and still others who have no strong opinions on the matter.”

Alumni Director Mike Teskey did not respond to _The Quest_&#8216;s request for comment by press time.
