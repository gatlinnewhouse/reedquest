It’s beginning to look a lot like rainy season here at Reed, and you know what that means. Amidst all of this work, you’ll look outside, see the sheets of rain pitter-pattering on your window, and you’ll feel even less like getting out and doing something off-campus. But, let me tell you, October is shaping up to be a great month for movies, music, and books, and you shouldn’t spend all of it cooped up in the library. As such, I’ve taken it upon myself to tell you where I will be going this month, because I’ve been told multiple times that I have great taste in music and movies (this is, ahem, _totally true_), and you should like/go to all the things that I like (I mean, if you want). Anyways, this is where yours truly will be in the month of October. Say hi if you see me there.

**Concert &#8211; Man Man w/Xenia Rubinos @ Hawthorne Theatre**

Even though Man Man has been mainstreaming their recorded music lately (read:making music that is markedly more boring and homogenized), their reputation for insane, spazzy live shows still holds up. It’s tonight, so cancel your plans and come scream ‘Van Helsing Boombox’ with me.

**Movie &#8211; Gravity (Opening Wide)**

Now, I don’t know if watching Sandra Bullock on screen for an hour and a half is a selling point (her and George ‘Now only the second-worst Batman’ Clooney are the only two actors on-screen), but seeing Alfonso Cuaron back in the director seat definitely is. (He directed the best Harry Potter movie and his last film, 2006’s ‘Children of Men’ was pretty cool as well.) Expect to feel crushing paranoia and agoraphobia while watching this film of astronauts stuck floating in space.

**Movie &#8211; Werner Herzog’s Nosferatu the Vampire @ Hollywood Theatre**

I’ll see anything by Herzog. His adaptation on the popular vampire myth, starring his old standby Klaus Kinski, is just the perfect way to kick off the month of Halloween.

**Wordstock**

Portland’s annual bookanalia is this weekend, featuring readings, signings, workshops, publishers booths, and a heaping load of bibliophile-baiting buys; if you care about the printed word, you should be going to this. I will be going on Saturday, to see authors Nicholson Baker and Robin Sloan, as well as graphic novelist Craig Thompson (seriously, read _Blankets_ and _Habibi_, they are both wonderful pieces of work). I will also be trying my hardest to not buy anything, which I will inevitably fail. So if you want to come with me to carry my shopping bags, let me know. As a bonus, Reed’s own Samiya Bashir will be giving a reading this Saturday.

**Concert &#8211; Thee Oh Sees w/ The Blind Shake, OBN III’s @ Hawthorne Theatre**

Thee Oh Sees is one of those bands I’ll see any time they come through wherever I’m at. Their garage-rock tunes and fast-paced live shows are the perfect environment for bouncy moshing. I know all y’all out there have way too much energy on Wednesday nights, so come and start some fights with me in the pit.

**Movie &#8211; Escape from Tomorrow @ Cinema 21**

Okay, so this Sci-Fi/Horror movie was filmed entirely in Disneyland without their permission. How insane is that? That alone makes it fascinating and possibly even groundbreaking in terms of the way cinema is made. Also, separated from that context, I hear the movie, which centers around a man questioning his perception of reality, still holds up as a great piece of work.

**Movie &#8211; Twelve Years a Slave (Opening Wide)**

This was the movie everyone was talking about after the Toronto Film Fest this year, and it promises to be _the_ award bait of the season. Even though that is usually a pretty disparaging comment, I have high hopes for this film. I hear Chiwetel Ejiofor is absolutely brilliant in the lead role as a free black man kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. With supporting turns from Michael Fassbender (this guy is everywhere), Benedict Cumberbumberdumberbatch, Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, and little-known character actor Brad Pitt. With the trustable Steve McQueen in the director’s chair, this is the Oscar movie worth seeing this season.

**KANYE WEST W/ KENDRICK LAMAR @ KEY ARENA, SEATTLE**

OH MY YEEZUS I’M SEEING KANYE EVERYONE SHOULD COME IT’S A GREAT WAY TO SPEND FALL BREAK

&nbsp;

_October 21_

**Reading &#8211; Junot Diaz @ Powell’s (Downtown)**

Diaz broke through with the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel _The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao_ a couple years back, a pretty great novel about walking the line between being a stereotypical American Nerd and a Dominican minority living in the ‘hood of New Jersey.’ His 2013 effort, the short story collection _This Is How You Lose Her_, takes a side character from the novel, Yunior, and puts his romantic failures on display to brilliant effect.

**Reading/Talk &#8211; Lydia Davis @ Yale Union**

Besides being an ‘acclaimed short story writer,’ Davis has a claim on being one of the most famous (one could say acclaimed) translators working today. She worked her magic on Flaubert’s classic _Madame Bovary_ and the first volume of _In Search of Lost Time_, _Swann’s Way_ (Seriously, how hardcore is that? Mutha effin Proust, I tell you what). This talk will mainly be centered on the work/art of translation, and should be fascinating.

**Movie &#8211; The Counselor @ Living Room Theater**

This movie features the original screenwriting debut of totally badass author Cormac McCarthy, which should be enough to get anyone in a theater seat. To add to that, the movie centers around a lawyer, played by Michael Fassbender, who decides that it would be a good idea to make some extra cash by getting into drug trafficking. Things obviously take a turn for the worst. So basically this is Breaking Bad-by-No Country For Old Men, which is probably the best (read: most depressing) thing ever. Hank himself (Dean Norris) is in here, as well as Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, and (guess who) Brad Pitt. See this movie.

**Movie &#8211; Blue is the Warmest Color (Limited Release)**

This movie won the Palme D’Or at Cannes this year, and I’ve been eagerly awaiting its stateside release since then. A three hour, brutally honest, coming-of-age lesbian romance story, this film sounds like it may have more in common with _Blue Valentine_ than the sapphire-hued title. Also, it is rated NC-17, for what has been described as the most realistic (i.e. awkward and gawky) sex scenes ever filmed, so there’s that.

&nbsp;

**Concert &#8211; CocoRosie w/Busdriver @ Wonder Ballroom**

Me and my BFF Madi are totally psyched to have a rad girl’s night out at this concert. CocoRosie is a duo made up primarily of sisters Bianca (Coco) and Sierra (Rosie), and they make music that ranges from freaky folk to hip hop to legit pop. Their latest album, _Tales of a GrassWidow_, features heavily on the hip hop side, but also has plenty of appearances by sad/beautiful crooner Antony (of Antony & The Johnsons).

**Concert &#8211; Janelle Monae @ Roseland Theater**

My main girl/person/robot Janelle is probably the funkiest touring/recording musician today, outside of dinosaurs like George Clinton or immortal nymphs like Prince (who endorsed Monae by appearing on her new album). Also, she is a mainstream queer performer, with pride and acceptance being a huge theme of her work. Basically, Janelle Monae is one of the coolest, most fashionable people in the world, and she is alleged to have one of the greatest live shows as well. I look forward to finding out if this is true.
