_A Call for Conversation_

I hope the recent news reports have helped move the conversation about the AOD policy and its implementation forward. The responsibilities of a news journalist are manifold, but when done rightly, seem to lead to a single conclusion: propagating information so that the readership can become as educated as possible about the issues.

This does not mean news should be trusted blindly. On the contrary, as much as it is the responsibility of the journalist to ask the right questions and discover the truth of those he or she is interviewing, it the duty of the readership to question any and all dubious statements; to force, as best it can, the news source to reveal its sources; and to respond in a fair and tempered manner when mendacity is revealed.

This duty however, can sometimes be misused. Though not necessarily on purpose, such misuse diminishes the ability of honest and progressive conversation to take place.

Thus I want to address an exclamation that has recently been circulating over articles I wrote.The claims are that Mike Brody lied to me when I asked him if there had been evictions on campus and that his lie was later revealed when it was discovered that threats of evictions had taken place.

To be perfectly clear: I asked Mike Brody, point blank, if there had been evictions on campus, and he gave me a point blank and honest response. The next week, when I asked him more broadly about threats of evictions, he gave me an honest response as well. If you wish to criticize me for not asking the right questions, you are more than justified. If you wish to criticize Mike Brody for not giving as extensive a response as he could have given, you are more than justified as well. Simply though, he did not lie to me, and saying that he did is inaccurate.

Again, I wish this not to be a call to silence, but a call for more debate and conversation about the role of AOD policy and its implementation at Reed. We, as a student body, are given the unique chance to help shape how our school will be kept safe and managed, but this task can only be done effectively if done responsibly and honestly.
