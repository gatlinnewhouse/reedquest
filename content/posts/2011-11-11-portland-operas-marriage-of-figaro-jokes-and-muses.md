The Portland Opera has begun its 47<sup>th</sup> season with a charming satire. Though this year’s theme (“When Our World Changes”) will be more evident in the rest of the season (Galileo Galilei by Philip Glass should definitely deliver in April), their rendition of Mozart’s _The Marriage of Figaro_ is strikingly successful, in a beautiful, funny way.

This rebellious rom-com the funniest show at the Portland Opera in the last two years. The hilarity of the libretto had the entire audience laughing, in a welcome departure from the solemnity of opera crowds. When Figaro discusses his birthmark, the woman next to him laughs and suggests that it is “in the shape of a spatula,” to which he responds: “Yes, how did you know?” Creative breaks in the fourth wall such as the lines “in true operatic style, let us end with a wedding” and “true romantics, forgive my deception” were especially surprising. Cherubino, the Count’s page, spent the entire show attempting to get into every woman’s knickers, and voyeurism is always fun.

_ __The Marriage of Figaro_ may alienate Reed audiences when Count Almaviva says “Honor, that source of all folly.” But this production matches Reed’s culture in that it is edgy. _The Marriage of Figaro_ is actually a radical departure from the cultural norms of Austria, where Emperor Josef II sponsored Mozart at the time of the writing. By adapting Pierre Beaumarchais’ controversial play, Mozart implicitly argued for equality between men and women and demonized the entitlement of the aristocracy. The same emperor who funded the opera had banned Beaumarchais’ play, but the musical beauty of the piece swayed him to support Mozart’s operatic adaptation.

The staging was phenomenal. The set took full advantage of the vertical opportunities afforded by the opera house. A semicircle of columns framed most scenes, and light came in from towering windows on either side of the stage. The denouement took place in a wash of blue light, but the Figaro and his bride had powerful yellow lanterns that illuminated their faces comically. The costumes emphasized the separation between classes, especially if social standing is measured by the length of one’s coattails.

The only risk of _The Marriage of Figaro_ is that the plot is more complicated than, for example, Beethoven’s _Fidelio,_ which has very few major characters. But by reading a synopsis of the plot beforehand, the subtleties of the show can be fully appreciated. These subtleties are where this opera is uniquely charming. However, the supertitles that quoted the Italian dialogue in English were unusually limited. Not all lines were translated, but that enabled you to get lost in the music.

Engaging and attractive, the visuals supported everything the music and libretto put forward.  The singers took the acting seriously, popping out from under beds and hiding from their superiors with full enthusiasm instead of the normal operatic stoicism.
