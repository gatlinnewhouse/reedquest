Some student groups may have missed the chance to receive votes. An unknown number of groups were not included in funding poll for the poll&#8217;s first few days, due to confusion on the part of signators as to how to register their groups for the poll.

Signators had to sign up for the poll in two distinct places on the SIN website. “It&#8217;s an error that&#8217;s understandable due to the somewhat confusing layout to SIN,” says Treasurer Johannes Harkins &#8217;14, but the error was ultimately the fault of the signators. “Instructions were laid out both in the Signators&#8217; Handbook as well as a reminder that was sent out in an email to signators prior to funding poll,” he says.

About 45 groups were not properly registered, says Vice President Aidan Sigman, but not all of these groups were attempting to register for funding poll. There is not yet information on how many of the groups may have lost the opportunity to receive votes because of the confusion.

Signators who contacted SIN webmasters and treasurers were promptly included in the poll, but in some cases, the damage may have been done. The Russian House was not entered into funding poll until after it began, says signator Auden Lincoln-Vogel. The Russian House did not break Top 40. “Perhaps we would have done better had there not been that delay,” says Lincoln-Vogel.
