**Age:** 21

**Hometown:** New York, NY

**Major:** Anthropology

**Looking for:** A man friend.
  
**
  
List three words to describe your ideal partner/companion/bedfellow:** Confident, funny, whiskey-drinkin’.
  
**
  
Got your eye on someone special right now?** I’ve got my library crushes but no, no one special.

**Would you feel uncomfortable referring to an intimate partner as your “mating companion”?** The word ‘mate’ makes me think of the Discovery Channel – instant mood killer.
  
**
  
Let’s be honest: booties are important. Would you refuse to date someone if you found that they did not have adequate junk in their trunk?** As long as it’s not concave I can deal.

**What about that OTHER kind of junk?** Haha no comment.

**In the event of a zombie apocalypse, what are the first five items you would grab?** Machete, combat boots, dehydrated food, maps, someone with all the outdoor survival skills you don’t learn growing up in the middle of the city.

**Brains over brawn or the other way around?** I wouldn’t be at Reed if I wasn’t into the brainy dudes.
  
**
  
Favorite Rom-Com?** Brown Sugar.

**Best date experience?** We met up to have a picnic on the Highline and quickly realized neither of us had looked up how to get there. Plus it was under construction. We ended up wandering around the Chelsea galleries and watching the sun set over the Hudson at a bar on a boat. If all of our plans fall through and I’m still having fun, it’s a good sign.

**Worst date experience?** Oh god, anything involving your parents.

**How do you feel about SugarDaddie.com? Have you considered it?** Considered, yes. Followed through, never.

**One word to describe the Reed dating scene:** Lol.
  
**
  
Please list three reasons why Team Edward is infinitely a better choice than Team Jacob. This is a mandatory question.** TEAMJACOB4LYFE.

**Do you self-identify as a hipster?** I think my clogs are my undoing.
