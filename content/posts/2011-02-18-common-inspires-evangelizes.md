“Greatness,” said Common from the podium in Kaul Auditorium on Wednesday evening, “is about finding your path and believing in it.”

As part of their initiative to procure higher-profile performers, speakers, and events, Gray Fund invited rapper Common to give a lecture this week on his keys to success.

Common, born Lonnie Rashied Lynn Jr., is a world-renowned Grammy-winning rapper frequently referred to as the “king of conscious hip-hop.” Known for his biting social commentary-inflected lyrics and burgeoning acting career (he has starred in films such as Smokin’ Aces, Wanted, and American Gangster), the Chicago native was dressed remarkably low-key for the occasion. Standing in front of a crowd of  more than 150 students and locals in a simple (but very tasteful) outfit consisting of a persimmon sweater layered over a cream-colored oxford and taupe slacks, he could easily have been mistaken for a young visiting professor or political activist – nothing in his outward appearance so much as suggested that this was the very same man who once penned the lyrics “I’m the truth, across the table from corporate lies/Immortalized by the realness I bring to it/If revolution had a movie I’d be theme music/My music, you can either fight, fuck, or dream to it” (from “The Sixth Sense,” off his 2000 album Like Water for Chocolate).

Once he began to speak, though, it was impossible to deny that this individual demanded respect and attention. Authoritative and self-assured, Common most certainly could have said anything at all and the audience would have hung onto his every word, captivated. The man undeniably had a presence about him. The casual confidence with which he spoke put the audience at ease and kept interest levels high throughout his entire address, a rare skill indeed.

Though Common started off with a fantastic freestyle about Reed and what he’d come to speak about, the actual lecture content initially contained more or less fluffy inspirational speech invoking listeners to follow their dreams and the like. It was only after several moments of the usual “believe in yourself” idioms that Common finally delved into the heart of his presentation – and even then it felt as though he was only scratching the surface. This was the man who wrote “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” the classic rap anthem that both criticized and mourned the death of hip-hop. To see him sidestepping any major statements and sticking to neutral (and completely PG-rated) lingo was slightly disappointing, to say the least.

That’s not to say that the lecture wasn’t outstanding. To see this man in person – an award-winning musical artist who had risen from the Southside of Chicago to become such a successful individual – was inspiring in and of itself. Referencing his own personal experiences and that of his (also super-famous) friends, Common crafted a short and sweet address on how having infallible faith in oneself will ultimately lead to success. Of course, it’s one thing to be a famous rap star and another to be a nineteen-year-old college student, but the look of rapture on the audience members’ faces was more than indicative that Common was getting through to them. Even when he began to talk about his faith and God, that most-ridiculed figure on Reed campus, heads were nodding and eyes remained faithfully glued to the charming celebrity on stage.

And Common was, on that stage, a living testament to his own words. Never fumbling for a single moment, he frequently talked about how he never doubted that he would make it as a star. He openly discussed his disappointment at losing a Grammy award to Kanye West, his grief over his cousin’s recent death, and how he had been musically inspired for an album by a breakup with another high-profile ex. Unapologetic and yet non-aggressive, he made it perfectly clear that he simply didn’t believe life’s mishaps are ever mistakes – they are just lessons that motivate and teach us how to be even more successful in the future. This outlook could easily be confused with an oversized ego, but Common presented it as just the outlook necessary for making it big.

Even Reedies, notorious for being somewhat sophomoric, were relatively short on the weird factor during the following question and answer session. Though one particularly bold freshman gave Common a heart-shaped lollipop (and received a hug in return), most questions were from genuine fans who wanted to know about Common’s political opinions, inspiration, and thoughts on the future of the music industry. Like a seasoned veteran accustomed to deflecting tough questions, Common gave cautious half-answers about transcending politics and embracing universal humanity; but the responses he did give were heartfelt and encouraging.

Overall, Common’s visit to Reed was an amazing opportunity that was ultimately overlooked. Most people were hoping to see a concert performance, and when they learned that he would strictly be lecturing decided against attending. A real shame – this event was a rare opportunity to see the man behind the myth, and get a glimpse into what it takes to become a legend.
