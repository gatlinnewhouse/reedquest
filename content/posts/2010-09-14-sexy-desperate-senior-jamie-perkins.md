Have you ever been driven to online dating by the Reed student body?
  
I’ve been driven to this. Isn’t that enough?

Looking for right now:
  
Fun buddy or something more serious? My current cuddle buddy insists on licking himself and smelling like dog. So, a step up from that would be nice.

Three words to describe ideal partner:
  
Not a Furry.

Body or brains?
  
Yes.

Dating freshman: cougar or pervy behavior?
  
Only pre-1992 need apply.

People should contact you if:
  
They know Aaron Paul or have extra board points.
