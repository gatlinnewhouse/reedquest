**Sara Tan**

_Sara Tan is currently studying abroad in Paris for her sophomore year. She writes of her first impressions of her new home – the coffee, the cigarettes, and the Frenchness of it all._

One of the first things that strikes you about Paris is the cafés. More specifically, the sheer number and variety of them. There is a café on nearly every corner and, more often than not, several to a block. Most of them are crowded, too, and sport a wide demographic: attractive and intimidating French students wearing striped shirts and tight jeans, tourists who accidentally leave a tip and are subsequently harassed by the confused wait-staff, and elderly women smoking slim “Vogue” cigarettes, exclaiming “ooh la la” at the cacophony of honking horns on the street.

My American friends and I soon became addicted to the tiny cups of espresso that constitute “un café.” Served with two sugar cubes on the side, the synergistic rush of sucrose and caffeine is too tempting to pass up.

Café etiquette is important and common sense alone is often insufficient. Do you wait for the server to acknowledge you, or do you immediately snag the last outdoor seats? If you want to eat as well as drink, is it taboo to sit at a table without a place setting? We soon figured out the rules and were casually seating ourselves and leaving exact change like nobody’s business. Confidence is everything.

So here is the picture: I am sipping espresso through a cloud of cigarette smoke, eyeing people as they pass by – the impeccably dressed Parisians and the odd tourist who actually waits for the light to change before walking across the street – and I suddenly realize that the main reason I’m doing this is because it makes me feel French with little actual effort. It’s easy to forget that we are speaking English, my American friends and I – and that saying “L’addition, s’il vous plait” doesn’t mean I can read untranslated Sartre without a dictionary.

Yes, I know where to sit if I want a plate of fries with my coffee. But wouldn’t my time be better spent talking nail polish colors with my gorgeous fifteen-year-old French host sister, Calliope, or job seeking at every bakery within a one mile radius of my apartment? Learning the words for nail polish and cash register would actually constitute a certain level of practical fluency over and above blending into a café.

If there’s one thing I’ll take back from this year abroad it’s that it isn’t easy to integrate oneself into a new city with a new language and a new culture without significant commitment. It takes a willingness to risk embarrassment, awkwardness, and failure. And since I feel socially inept even in my home country, it will take more than to simply “step outside of my comfort zone” to become a bona fide Parisian. I’ll have to leave my comfort zone so far behind that I can’t even see it anymore, and the initial reason I decided to apply for this program was to force myself to do just that. I want to make the most of this remarkable opportunity, and I do not want “the most” to be that I can order coffee and wolf down a croque monsieur with panache and ease.

By the time these thoughts passed, I had tipped back the dregs of my espresso and was digging into my wallet for centimes. Later that night I received a text from a friend inviting me to hang out with her twenty-something host brother, Guillaume, and his friends. I would be meeting new people and struggling with communication. It would be a perfect opportunity to test my newfound resolve.

The only thing was that I was truly terrified. Resolve is one thing. Application is another. At the very last minute, allowing no time to change my mind, I hurriedly sent a reply.

Moments later: I am clutching a plastic cup of whiskey and coke, leaning back against the steps of the 15th Arrondissement mayor’s building and laughing with several friendly, fashion-forward Parisians. A crowded bar was our next destination and it was 2a.m. when my friend and I left. In a giggling haze of French and alcohol, we rode home on the last Metro train of the night.

I dreamt in that language – the language of love – that night. Stilted, halting French, but French nonetheless.

I took a risk, and it paid off. I know that that won’t always be the case, but I’m prepared to take the chance. Chalk this up as having learned one thing abroad so far. And of course, there was the other slightly less consequential lesson, which wasn’t so much learned as reinforced: alcohol is an awesome facilitator.
