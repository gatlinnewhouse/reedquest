One of the many zines available for your enjoyment and education 24/7 with swipe card access in the infoshop is “Greenwashing and You!”, which examines the trend of businesses marketing their products as “green”. This appeals to consumers because if the products we already buy are “green”, we can save the planet without even changing our lifestyles. Woohoo! We’re geniuses! The market is working! Unfortunately, this zine goes on to explain that simply buying “green” cat litter is not enough to keep the planet from going to shit, and neither is a switch to fuel cells, wind turbines, or whatever your favorite hippy-dippy alternative source of energy happens to be. If we used biofuel the way we use fossil fuels, people in third world countries would have to grow fuel for us instead of food for themselves. “Any economy that is based on constant growth and ever-increasing consumption is by its very nature unsustainable,” claims the zine. So what should we do?  “Greenwashing and You!” writes up a sobering prescription: “&#8230;prepare to part with the world of industrial civilization.” This seems like an unrealistic expectation of society at large, and the later advice to generally fuck shit up seems a bit haphazard. The inhumane conditions of sweatshops are indeed nauseating, but razing them as recommended would put people out of the only jobs available to them. However, I can’t really blame this zine for its idealism. There is no prefect answer to what we should do. No matter how you slice it, we consume too much, and stopping is never going to be popular. Overall, “Greenwashing and You!” is a good, basic, easy-to-read introduction to why we can’t go green within our current system.  Go read it!
