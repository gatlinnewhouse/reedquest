As you walk around campus, take a closer look at the flower beds and you will find some colorful surprises. As of this week, Zia Rady, a second year Biology major, has placed a bevy of brightly painted rocks throughout Reed with the hopes of brightening up both campus and your day. The rocks are painted with different colors, designs, and themes. The Reedies who helped paint them clearly let their imaginations run wild, painting unique abstract designs on some, writing kind messages on others, and even turing a few into pickles. 

Zia began thinking about this project even as a prospie. She remembers “loving the campus, but wishing it had some more art and fun colors.” After debating different methods of introducing colors to the campus, she decided to go with rock painting because it was simple yet effective. It was also important to her to include other community members in the process. “It seemed like a feat to paint them all by myself, and then it would be a narrow perspective if only I painted them,” Zia said.

Over the course of three Paideia classes with close to fifty total participants, Zia encouraged students and other community members to paint rocks with images and colors that would make them happy. Zia also began reaching out to faculty members and encouraging them to each design a rock based on their area of study. Some of the rocks are placed randomly, but those with academic themes are placed outside of the buildings that correspond to their areas of study. 

Zia hopes the process of painting the rocks will help students to relax and enjoy themselves. One student who attended multiple rock painting events, Rugby Simon, commented, “I think Zia's idea is really fun. The actual painting of the rocks was a super relaxing way to spend a couple hours and now I get to see all these colorful rocks all over campus. I think it the rocks really brighten up campus.”  Other students have expressed their joy at seeing the rocks too, as one student on a Facebook thread commented, “whoever held the rock painting paideia class is a blessing. I love spotting the little colourful rocks around and they make me smile a little bit each time I see them and I have seen at least a solid 20 of them over the past few days.” It seems that even the animals who populate the campus appreciate the color. Another student, Helen Zhang, said on Facebook, “It makes me feel like I’m discovering a treasure every time I notice a new one! And today I saw a ladybug hanging out on one of them so that ladybug must like them too!” 

When asked if there were more ways to participate in the rock painting trend, Rady stated, “you can still engage in a number of ways: One, host a dorm or department rock painting event by contacting me atziarady@reed.edu for supplies. Two, follow the Instagram account @reed.rocks. Three, Rock Hunt: Check the _Quest_ or Instagram for the “Rock of the Week” and the first three people to post a picture of themselves with the rock using the hashtag #reedrocks will get their picture reposted on the @reed.rocks Instagram. I hope you continue to have a wonderful semester and I hope that you enjoy seeing the fun rocks across campus and take time to check out some of the amazing work your peers have completed! Together we make Reed rock!” So, even if you missed out on the first few rock painting events, there is still time to get involved and help make our campus a little more colorful.
