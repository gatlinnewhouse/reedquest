What does “Barbra Streisand” mean to me? Oh god, where do I even begin? For starters, Barbra Streisand is deliciously danceable disco-house with a New York ethos attached to it. But that’s Choi the douchebag DJ talking. On a more personal level, Barbra Streisand is about take-out food; specifically, pizza.

You could say that my family and I order pizza a lot. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it’s family activity. One of the hallmarks of eating pizza is, unquestionably, that we have the same deliveryman, one whose quadrisyllabic name we unrelentlessly sing to the tune of Barbra Streisand.

I have a weird family.

When I hear the first beats of “Barbra Streisand”, I instantly think of sunny days spent cruising around my home turf, the great and magnificent NYC. It’s summertime and it’s hot as sin and humid enough to make you sweat buckets but my goodness – is it glorious! Hanging out in Union Square with the skateboarders and hitting the clubs with my number one ladies in the most scandalous outfits, riding the 7 train with an oversized (and perspiring) iced coffee clutched in one hand on the way to work, getting drunk on rooftops and actually believing, for a moment, that the city is ours to take…

Nothing can really describe the feeling I get when I hear that chorus. It’s electric. I feel really alive, like I’ve got nothing to prove to anyone other than myself. And all I want to prove to myself is that I’m capable of having a good time. I recall watching the sun rise over the empty streets as my friends and I staggered home after another amazing night of debauchery and silliness, laughing about how absolutely amazing it feels to just be young and alive.

Barbara Streisand’s hit song, “Duck Sauce” isn’t hers at all. I don’t understand why she gets to put her name on it. I mean, c’mon, aside from her name being repeated now and again, she doesn’t have any real claim to the synthesized masterpiece.

Don’t get me wrong, I love it. I just don’t understand why she gets to release it as a single. The video for the song is a veritable who’s-who of the New York music scene, but the diva herself makes no appearance.

Perhaps “Duck Sauce” is the new Yentl, and Ms. Streisand is disguised as one of the men in the video. I doubt it , though.

This is proof that Barbara is inferior to Cher. While I applaud the singer for reinventing herself, I frown on her lack of obvious participation. In Burlesque, there is no doubt that Cher is an active participant. For “Duck Sauce,” this simply isn’t the case. Barbara, darling, I’m sorry but after hearing “Duck Sauce,” I only want to call you a mother-Focker. Say hello to Ben Stiller for me. Love, J.
