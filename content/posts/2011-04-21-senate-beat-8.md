**SSASS**

Discussion with Students for Sexual Assault Support Services (SSASS) dominated the bulk of the meeting. They all showed up in purple. SSAS’s purpose of coming to Senate was to get Senate support on a petition that they are currently circulating. For those who have not seen the petition, the petition asks Colin Diver to support many of the same points that are in the tentative Ad Hoc Committee charge (this document has yet to be released). The petition asks Colin to support four points: 1. The removal of sexual assault cases from J-Board’s jurisdiction. A new board will be created to hear these cases. 2. The creation of a new position for an Assistant Dean of Sexual Assault Prevention and Advocacy. 3. Hire a female-identified Women’s Center staff person. 4. Release and make publicly available the identities of all individuals found guilty of sexual assault consistent with the Department of Education’s interpretation of Title IX and FERPA. This last point was the most controversial.

This sparked a lengthy debate amongst Senate, SSASS, and Senate attendees, specifically around the first and fourth points of the petition. Senator Carlisle, as well as others, is concerned by the possibility that students will no longer play an active role in adjudicating these crimes. The point was made that it is really important for students to continue playing an active role in this capacity so we can maintain student autonomy. On the other hand, a popular point that was made is that students simply aren’t capable of adequately and effectively hearing these cases, due to lack of training and other issues, including that hearing these cases can be extremely emotionally trying for both student J-Board members as well as a complaintant and respondant who are being tried by their peers.

On point of releasing the names of individuals found guilty of sexual assault (point four), Mike Brody and SSASS disagree completely. While Brody believes we are currently in compliance with FERPA and Title IX, SSASS does not. In support of implementing SSASS’s fourth point, without full disclosure, RDs (and other staff/faculty) have no way of making informed decisions when hiring HAs (and other for other student positions).

Basically, this was an extremely heated debate. All parties agree that changes need to be made to the system that is currently in place, the point of contention is how we should be about making those changes and precisely what those changes should be. For this reason, Senate agreed to give SSASS their support, in that Senate supports the efforts being made, but not necessarily everything on the petition. In addition, Senate agreed to draft a letter of support after the Ad Hoc Committee releases their recommendations.

Meeting adjourned.
