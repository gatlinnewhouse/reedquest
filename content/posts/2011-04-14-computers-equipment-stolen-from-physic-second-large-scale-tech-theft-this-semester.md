Late Sunday, several computers and pieces of equipment were stolen from the Physics building, amounting to thousands of dollars in stolen assets. This is the second theft in the Physics building this semester; the first of which took place in January and involved a theft of similar items.

The stolen items in question were five laptops, six iMac desktop computers, and several analytical balances. They were taken from Physics 129 and Biology 207, computer laboratories that are primarily used for introductory physics classes. These rooms were subject to similar thefts on January 28, and both incidents involved the forced removal of the laboratory door. The break in was discovered early Monday morning and Portland police were informed.

The Physics department is unsure of what will come of having two large-scale thefts in such a short period of time. “We’re kind of sitting ducks right now,” said John Essick, professor of physics and current department chair. “Everything is kind of up in the air.”

Essick noted that CUS replaced the technology that was stolen after the last theft, but was uncertain about the feasibility of replacing expensive equipment again in such a short period of time. In the meantime, the Physics department will be transferring equipment between laboratories.

The theft is suspected to be one in a series of Mac-related thefts in the greater Portland community and not an event isolated to the Reed community. Portland Police are conducting an investigation alongside Community Safety, the latter of which was unavailable for comment at the time of publishing.

In addition, new security measures have also been taken in an attempt to theft-proof the physics labs. These measures involve an alarm system and metal plates on the door hinges.

“I’m happy to see that they are taking measures to prevent any more stealing,” said Matthew Lambert ‘12, a physics major. “It’s just frustrating that it took two times for them to do anything about it.”
