Reading a scientific paper gives an in-depth but very narrow view of what’s going on in a field, but conversing with one of the scientists who actually did the work gives a more complete picture. Last Monday we got to talk with Dr. Rachel Wong, a pre-eminent neuroscientist who visited our Developmental Neurobiology seminar, not in person, but via Skype.

Rachel also happens to be the senior author on many of the papers we’ve been reading. It was a real honor to be able to ask some of our many questions about how two neurons in different parts of the eye find each other and form synapses amidst the vast sea of retinal neurons.

When we asked how one specific type of bipolar cell “knows” to connect with a specific type of ganglion cell, Rachel didn’t have the reply we were expecting.

“So, how many of you know M&Ms?”

She paused as we all timidly raised our hands.

She then explained that everyone probably has a favorite M&M color, like blue, and your default behavior is to always pick blue M&Ms out of the bowl first. Yellow might be your second favorite, and if all of the blue M&Ms are gone, you might take a yellow one instead, but you would never choose a brown or a green one. This simple scenario of people choosing M&Ms is similar to the complex one in the retina of retinal ganglion cells choosing bipolar cells to synapse with. Rachel’s lab has developed transgenic mice that lack some “colors” of bipolar cells. With these mice, they are able to observe how ganglion cells behave when they can’t choose their favorite type of partner. Just like us, ganglion cells seem to have back-ups that they connect with when their favorite type of cell isn’t available.

The M&M analogy helps us think of useful questions to ask: How do the retinal ganglion cells choose their favorite “color” of bipolar cell? Why do they even have a favorite? It turns out we don’t know the functional difference between retinal ganglion cells that causes them to prefer to synapse with different types of bipolar cells, but now we can begin to find out.  In Rachel’s words, “The problem is very simple. The answer might not be, but the problem is simple.”

How does science tackle such problems?  Rachel’s answer was quite intuitive: “I believe to solve any important question, its good to attack that question through many different approaches.” Rachel’s team is composed of researchers with distinct and diverse backgrounds, including electrophysiology, molecular biology, and computational mathematics. Her team converges around their shared interest in retinal imaging, and this helps them tackle work thoroughly and efficiently. Rachel advised the future researchers in our class to not “be limited by how you answer [&#8230;] questions technique wise.”

Rachel also talked about the importance of communicating science to the general public (something we’ve tried to do this semester with these columns). This can be challenging when many important and interesting results aren’t controversial or curing diseases. Rachel believes that “you can get across how important a problem is to the general public without having to dress it up too much&#8230;and that’s where the M&M’s come in.”

_Rachel’s lab is currently looking at retinal circuit development in various vertebrate systems as well as retinal regeneration in zebrafish. To find out more, visit her lab’s [beautiful web-page][1]._
