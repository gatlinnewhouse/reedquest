The culprit was asked for their account of the incident and agreed to give it on the condition that their anonymity be preserved. Said culprit will be referred to by the grammatically, though not politically, correct “he.” Any objections should be directed to the editors of _The Quest_.

While the event occurred on Oct. 24, only now have details come to light.

He says, “I had gone to the Crystal Castles concert the night before and I was really tired, you know? And all I wanted was one of those nice, fresh, flaky Commons’ croissants. But, by the time I got up it was too late for any of that and all I could find was one of the cold, hard, beginning to go stale, wheat ones.

“But beggars can’t be choosers, so I take the croissant, and I think to myself, ‘If I toast this maybe I can revive it, bring it closer to that fresh out of the oven flakiness I was so craving. And at the very least it’ll be warm.’

“So I go over to the toaster only to find that the croissant’s too big for the toaster. And I didn’t want to force it in so I just rested it on the outermost edge of the conveyer belt thing. I turned around for a second to grab a plate for it, and when I turned back it had been sucked into the innards of the toaster by the conveyor belt, and as I watched with horror it was drawn further and further into the toaster until it reached the orange lights in the back and caught fire.

“So now my morning really sucks, you know? My breakfast is on fire in the toaster. I grab a fork and am trying to pry it out when one of the Commons’ employees, seeing that the toaster’s on fire, comes running over, unplugs the toaster and then tries to help me by sticking a plastic plate in and attempting to use it to get the croissant out when the plastic on the plate starts to melt and Commons is filled with this acrid burning smell, and they have to wheel the toaster out. That’s the last I saw of it.”

He feels remorse for the part he played in the incident but denies culpability. “How was I supposed to know the thing was going to go up in flames?”

Freshmen Maia Scarpetta says of the incident, “It sucks. We no longer have the capacity to toast a fuck ton of bagels. We require the capacity to toast a fuck ton of bagels.”

Freshman Brydon Brancart also took the loss of the toaster seriously, going as far as to challenge the culprit to a witch hunt, “What we need are some pitchforks and torches. Then “bam!” we get it back. I’ll bring the fire if the perpetrator will bring the toaster. Back from the dead. Or the recycling. Wherever it went.”

Junior Ari Galper, a Senator, is equally distraught, “Fuck yeah it’s serious. It has significantly altered the course of my mornings. When there’s a line I have to walk away in disdain. The old toaster was aesthetically pleasing, a fine example of the technological progress of man, the industrial age. This puny replacement toaster is nothing.”

Marcus Robinson, asked if he knew the whereabouts of the toaster, replied, “No comment,” while glancing around him with suspiciously shifty eyes.

But freshman Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche has a positive view on the whole catastrophe. “People need to let go of the romanticism of the old toaster. It used to burn my bagel every morning. Every single morning. It’s time this school joined the 21st century and got a new toaster.”
