Vollum 120 looked more like a war-torn battlefield than a classroom by the time we finished with it. Senators that had given up were passed out on the floor, and those still standing were red-eyed with exhaustion. Dirty paper plates, empty champagne bottles, and the remnants of a fifth of whiskey cluttered the room.

It may seem glamorous, but Funding Hell just isn’t pretty. We have a great time on Saturday, sure. There’s all sorts of food, cool people, and we get to hear about all the cool stuff that’s going to happen on campus that semester. But when it comes down to making hard decisions, Senate is torn apart by shouts, personal attacks, and general exhaustion.

This isn’t because Senate is filled with mean, hurtful people. No, this particular Sunday is fraught with conflict because of one simple fact: scarcity. Reedies have a lot of badass ideas, but most of these cost money. And despite the fact that we raised the student body activity fee a couple years ago, the money Senate has doesn’t seem to go far.

Though student government has approximately $180,000 to spend each semester, a lot of this is caught up in obligations the organization has made. Wages and grants eat up about $70,000 each semester, no negotiations allowed, and the Top 40 organizations typically request $200,000, double what remains.

So your dedicated senators, these hyper-involved Reedies that care deeply about their school, throw themselves into this impossible calculus. There are no right answers in this conference, no easy way to determine whether that $200 is better spent on bike tubes or board games. How can you know if people will have more fun at Dia De Los Muertos or Oktoberfest? And what’s this obsession with fun? Shouldn’t we bring intelligent and passionate speakers to campus?

It gets painful very quickly. Tensions erupt and personal associations come to the surface. People cry. Because Senate wants to get it right. In a slow semester, this weekend is arguably Senate’s most important. Fun on-campus events can forge a powerful community, and a dearth of them can send upperclassmen spinning away from the Reed bubble, jaded and bitter.

If you see a senator this week, be kind. They’re about to get knee-deep in hell.
