A Reed Union on the state of the Honor Principle occurred Monday night before a crowd of over 400 students, faculty, staff and alumni, nearly filling Kaul Auditorium.

The Union, the first since 2007, was proposed by members of Honor Council to discuss the “state of the Honor Principle.” Reed Unions are described by the college as “moderated discussion featuring panels of experts in dialogue with members of the audience” and are intended to serve as a Reed-wide forum for addressing topics of importance to the community. The structure of this Reed Union was a panel followed by questions offered by attendees. The panel was comprised of community members holding a variety of different positions within Reed, and included two professors, two student members of Honor Council, an alumnus and former co-chair of J-Board, the president of the college, dean of student services, and a residence director for on-campus housing.

Moderator Paul Hovda, professor of philosophy, framed the event by emphasizing the goal of bringing the community together to share a variety of different perspectives and create a mutual understanding of the Honor Principle.

Hovda encouraged the first hour of questions to address the current state of the Honor Principle, while the second hour explored its future potential. Audience contributions generally touched on issues of communication: the location of responsibility in navigating potential disagreements; the Honor Principle as a tool of power; the relationship between administrators, students, and the law; and merits and demerits of an unwritten code of conduct.

In anticipation of the Union, Honor Council conducted a survey of the student body to identify the most pressing honor-related issues in the community. Responses, disseminated via email four days before the event, ranked sexual harassment and assault, mental health, stealing, academic dishonesty, decision-making in altered states, drug use, discrimination, alcohol use, smoking, vandalism, and noise as the primary topics of concern.

In spite of this, the majority of the conversation was theoretically-based and focused on the issue of the Honor Principle as a model for community governance. “It surprised me that no one chose to ask questions or make statements about specific issues like sexual assault and the AOD policy,” said Lizzie Sandercock, student member of Honor Council since December 2009.

“We specifically did not want to guide the discussion and block out portions of time to discuss specific issues, because we did not want to put constraints on which topics would be brought up,” she explained. “While I think that it’s important for the theoretical issues of the Honor Principle, I would have liked to see how people related [these] specific issues to the Honor Principle.”

Matt Kumar, a junior English major, waited in line to present a question to the panel but was prevented from doing so by time constraints. Afterward he expressed a great deal of frustration with lack of discussion around sexual assault as a particularly pressing issue. Said Kumar, “Listening to President Diver and a panel of other stewards of the college discourse around the exhortation to honor in no way illuminated their perspective on how honor works (or doesn’t) in relation to real acts of violence within our community: acts which harm not only individual victims but also, in my view, the body of the community as a whole.”

Reflecting on this absence, Kumar drew a connection between the unwillingness of the assembled group to substantively address this sensitive issue and the impact of confidentiality on the opportunities for support available to sexual assault survivors: “The silence of the Union on sexual assault not only doubles the silence pushed upon victims after they seek judicial action through the school, but reinforces it as well: if we as a community are unable to speak about sexual violence, we certainly keep victims of that violence quiet as well.”

In reflecting on the Union, lab instructor Carey Booth described the influence of the Honor Principle on her relationship with her students in Introduction to Biology. At Portland State University, where she teaches during the summer, all exams are administered with instructors present to prevent cheating.

“I love working here because we can say ‘Honor Principle, take the exam, bring it back’ and we trust students to do it,” she explained. She said that she has only participated in two honor cases related to academic dishonesty since she joined the biology department in 1989 and has used informal mediation, in the form of an open dialogue with a lab section, to address rumors of falsifying of research in lab reports.

Carla Mann, professor of dance and an alumna of the undergraduate program, joined the Honor Council as a faculty committee member in September 2010. Like many of the panelists, she drew a distinction between the Honor Principle and the processes in place to adjudicate violations.

Reflecting on her experiences with the college, Mann described the day-to-day discussions surrounding the Honor Principle as an integral aspect of the Reed education. “Living with the Honor Principle while I was a student at Reed helped me realize that I had both the responsibility and the agency to have a positive affect in the world; it was a huge factor in how politically active I was when I first left Reed,” she said, adding, “Living in a community governed by the Honor Principle helped make me aware that I was not only capable of having a positive impact but that it was my responsibility to help shape the broader community for the better.”

Mann also suggested that the experience that Reedies gain by engaging with ethical issues on a daily basis informs their commitment to higher ideals in all aspects of their lives. For her part, she explained, “I learned how to be a citizen of Reed and from there, a citizen of the world.”
