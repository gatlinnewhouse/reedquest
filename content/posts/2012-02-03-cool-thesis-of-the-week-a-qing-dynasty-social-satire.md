_Each week, The Quest profiles the thesis of one senior whose work is worth sharing with the Reed community. The purpose of this column is to increase awareness among Reedies of the work being done in various academic fields and to make disparate forms of scholarship accessible and understandable to all._

    Rex Crabb '12 wants to learn how satire can be constructive.
  </p>
</div>

Throughout their primary education, American students are taught the proper structure of a story: Narrative arcs have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and they follow one or two main characters through a path of personal change and growth.

Not so in traditional Chinese literature, says Rex Crabb &#8217;12. Rex, of Providence, Rhode Island, explains that “with Chinese novels, the historical comes before the fictional,” though “there is not much distinction between the two.” This is the narrative form taken by “The Scholars,” a comically satirical work of social commentary of the late Qing Dynasty in the mid-18<sup>th</sup> century, and the topic of Rex&#8217;s thesis. In his thesis, which he is working on with Professor Alexei Ditter, Rex will examine the use of collective memory in the text to construct an overarching historical narrative.

Dynastic Chinese culture, says Rex, was characteristically backwards-looking, with an emphasis on ancestor worship and an idea of “reclaiming the ancient kingdom.” “The Scholars” looks favorably on the past by mocking the present, satirizing many objectionable aspects of late Qing society. For example, says Rex, the Chinese civil service exams, known for their exhaustive brutality, “had little to do with effective governance.” What was called “true scholarship,” he goes on, actually consisted of scholars “going around and having huge parties, gossiping about one another.” Also satirized was the habit of the mercantile elite of “buying themselves the literati lifestyle,” because, Rex says, the “image of power was connected to scholarship.”

“The thing with satire is that it&#8217;s always really easy to see what it&#8217;s breaking down,” says Rex. However, “it also builds something up if it&#8217;s good satire.” In “The Scholars,” Rex says, this is achieved as “the author destructs and reconstructs a concept of collective memory.” For example, rituals are a point of focus: One major event in the novel is the reconstruction of a temple to a historical figure, and the ensuing ritual practices around it.

However, says Rex, ritual alone is not enough in “The Scholars.” “We can&#8217;t just have these rituals and wait for Confucius to come back,” he says, “we have to understand the virtues of history.” Though the narrative follows multiple characters across three generations, the novel begins by telling the story of Wang Mian, an intellectual from much earlier, the Yuan dynasty in the late 14<sup>th</sup> century. Wang Mian “lives life the right way,” says Rex: “He studies because what he&#8217;s studying is cool; he paints because what he&#8217;s painting is beautiful&#8230; He&#8217;s like a Yuan Dynasty Reedie.” All the later characters are implicitly compared with Wang Mian, setting up from the beginning a historical context whose memory will recur through the story.

It is through this understanding of history in collective memory that the satire of “The Scholars” offers its constructive commentary. The Chinese believed in a “natural repetition in history,” says Rex, but “The Scholars” sees a role for action based on active comprehension of this fact. “History repeats itself,” summarizes Rex, “but not only does it repeat itself naturally, we can force it to repeat itself in favorable ways.”
