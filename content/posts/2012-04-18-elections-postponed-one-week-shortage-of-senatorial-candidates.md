Spring semester Student Body elections have been postponed for one week. Only two candidates had turned in petitions to vie for the six open seats on Senate in time for the original deadline, Wednesday April 11. The deadline was subsequently extended two days, but no further candidates submitted petitions.

Elections had originally been scheduled for Wednesday April 18-Friday April 20, with Elections Assembly slated for the 18<sup>th</sup>. Assembly will now occur on Tuesday April 24 at 7:00 in the Student Union, with elections open from that day until Friday April 27.

Senate and the Elections Czars made the decision to postpone the process to allow time for more candidates to enter their names. Senator Shabab Mirza emphasized the importance of student involvement in Senate, saying, “if you want to do certain things at this place, it has to be through the Student Body.” Elections Czar Jacob Canter encouraged any and all students to enter the election, calling the post of Senator an “incredibly important” position that “not only has an effect on student life but on how Reed College is run as an institution.” Hopeful candidates can find petitions in Commons, the Paradox, and the Library. 25 signatures are needed to enter the elections; completed petitions can be turned in to MS 200 or MS 128 by Monday April 23 at 5:00.

As of the original deadline, only current Senator John Iselin, running for reelection, and Vas Srivastava, running for the first time, had acquired the necessary signatures for their candidacy. Canter says he knows of at least one more candidate who will run and is hopeful for at least a few more.

In the event that there are still not enough candidates after the extended deadline, elections will proceed as planned and a special election next fall will fill the vacancies.

Running collectively as “_Quest_er A. Arthur,” five current _Quest_ editors and with three new editors are on the ballot for reelection to _Quest_ Board. No other boards have entered the race.
