Night Shift

_Interview by Robert Shryock_

&nbsp;

_So how do you pronounce your name?_

Like Shane.

&nbsp;

_How do you like working night shift?_

I am the Dark Knight, keeping watch over the time when the rest of the Reed community has eased into the land of Nod (or at least _should_ be). Nights can either be insane or boring as hell. You see weird shit, medical transports, weird people, oh, my toliet&#8217;s overflowing, things like that. Around 3 AM it winds down, that&#8217;s when it gets boing.

&nbsp;

_Why did you become a CSO?_

Honestly, it was a job of opportunity that just happened to turn into a very rewarding endeavor.

&nbsp;

_Where are you from?_

I grew up on a rez, but I moved at least once a year until I got to Portland. My mom was a bit of a nomad, but when we got here we both felt totally at home. When I got to Portland, I looked like a total freak, trench coat, steel-toed Doc Martens, a facial peircing, I looked weird. And even with all that, little old ladies walked up to me to ask me directions, “COULD YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET TO COUCH STREET?” It felt great.

&nbsp;

_You said you grew up on a rez. What was that like?_

It was great. It was boring at the time, but in retrospect I had total freedom, I could do anything I wanted. Let&#8217;s see.  I took baths in an oil drum. We would light a fire under it and get in. That was awesome.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite food?_

Just about anything, but I absolutely adore Korean food. Jeeze, now I&#8217;m craving some bibimbap!

&nbsp;

_What hobbies do you have?_

I really like film, and was into music back in the day. I was in several industrial bands. There is nothing better than doing live shows.  Around 2000, I was in this band called Bound in Oblivion. I did keyboards, some programming and percussion work. That blew up in a typical way- the lead singer of the band went off the deep end and the band imploded. I haven&#8217;t played much since then, except for solo stuff that I haven&#8217;t really shared with anyone.

&nbsp;

_What is your spirit animal?_

Krafayis. Put your nerd glasses on, kiddies.

&nbsp;

_What&#8217;s that from?_

Doctor Who. It&#8217;s the monster from Vincent in the Doctor. It&#8217;s like a Griffin!

&nbsp;

_I love Doctor Who! How long have you been a fan?_

Since 1978. I loved the new series, though.

&nbsp;

_Who was your favorite doctor?_

I would have said Tom Baker for most of my life, but David Tennant really won me over. I&#8217;m so enamored with those door tags on Naito 3 that have the Doctor Who characters on them. And the portraits of the doctor in the Griffin common room.

&nbsp;

_What are you rocking out to in the CSO-mobile?_ 

97.9, when it is actually broadcasting.

&nbsp;

_Who is your celebrity crush?_

Zhang Ziyi.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite thing about your job?_

Hands-down, the interactions with the amazingly diverse, intelligent, challenging student body. I love that I can have nerdy conversations about Doctor Who, science, mathmatics, the meaning of life, anything. Even if people don&#8217;t see eye to eye here, they get along.

&nbsp;

_Obviously being a CSO is the best job ever, but if you weren&#8217;t a CSO, what would you like to do?_ 

Motion picture editing as a main gig, and using my stunt training as a side-gig.

&nbsp;

_Stunt training?_

Did I say that? Yeah, a few years ago I took a workshop in Vancouver. I learned all the basic stuff, but never made a career out of it. That would have required me to move to LA, which I just didn&#8217;t want to do.

&nbsp;

_So what&#8217;s this about motion picture editing?_

I know way too much about film. Back when, I had a show on Portland Brodcasting called Trinity by Night about the underground music scene in Portland. It was a short lived show because it took so much work to keep up. But yeah, I love movies. I would do it, except I&#8217;d have to live in Hollywood.

&nbsp;

_Seems like you&#8217;re kind of a nerd._

I like being a nerd.
