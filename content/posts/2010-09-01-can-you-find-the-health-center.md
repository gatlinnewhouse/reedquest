Reed is mixing things up by playing a little switcheroo this year with office locations! If you were around last year, you may have encountered some major confusion with the new arrangements, but never fear &#8211; we&#8217;ve got it all spelled out for you right here. So now you _really_ don&#8217;t have any excuse for not knowing where anything is.

The plans to give everyone more convenient space were set in motion last November when a group of administrators from different departments compiled a massive document and submitted it to the facilities committee. Senate hopped on board, and the tedious process of figuring out exactly what went where began in November. By May the layout was finalized and ready to go.

The Health & Counseling Center has left its cozy spot just off the GCC and has made a new home in the gray building just north of 28 West. Moving in to the former HCC facility is the Student Activities Office. SEEDS has claimed the former SAO space in GCC 104, and is sharing it with International Student Services (ISS). The Multicultural Resource Center (MRC) is shacking up with the SAO in the former HCC building.

You&#8217;ll also note some additional renovations that have gone into making the new facilities more suitable for their new residents. Make a point to familiarize yourself with the new layout, and don&#8217;t forget to attend the open houses scheduled for this Thursday, September 2. Drop by from 3 to 5 pm to meet administrators, scope out the new spaces, and grab some food. And what Reedie says no to free food?
