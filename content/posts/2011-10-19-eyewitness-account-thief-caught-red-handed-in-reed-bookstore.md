At around 12:20pm on Tuesday the 27<sup>th</sup>, I walked into Marianna Mullen’s office to ask her questions for a Quest article on the Bookstore thefts that occurred over the summer (see page X). At the same moment she received a call from the CSOs, who told her that an anonymous tip had just called dispatch, with information that a man was just leaving his house with plans to steal textbooks from the Bookstore. Dhyana Cabarga, a community safety officer, along with Gina Ensunsa and Mullens planted themselves in locations around the bookstore and kept an eye on the door for any suspicious activity. The plan was to keep Cabarga in clear view of the door, to deter the possible perpetrator from entering at all. I went to the candy section, and spent time choosing between yogurt raisins and sour Skittles.

At 12:35pm, a stocky young man slowly walked into the Bookstore. He was white, wearing a dark green military cap, a dark brown sweater and skinny black jeans. He was unshaven and wore a medium-sized messenger bag around his shoulder. Walking in, he asked Ensunsa whether she had found his glasses he lost earlier in the Bookstore. She mentioned that he should probably check 28 West. He had no response, and instead went over to the textbooks section of the store and began looking through the piles. Mullens and Cabarga changed their positions, Ensunsa kept an eye on him from behind the counter, and I went to the cashier to buy my Skittles. After fifteen minutes, the man left the Bookstore without saying anything. I stepped outside to see what direction he had gone in, but by then he was gone.

Back in the Bookstore at ten to one, Mullens, Ensunsa and I were discussing whether we had ever seen this stocky man on campus before. None of us had, but before we could decide if that news meant anything, Mullens saw the man through the window walking back into the GCC, this time with a woman beside him. Later named by the man as Rachel, she was white, wearing all black, with short black hair tied tightly in a ponytail down to her shoulders. I had already stepped back to the political science section of the textbooks, and was looking through a _Marxist Reader_ as the man walked passed me and to the opposite aisle. He spent most of his time looking at titles of texts and fidgeting with his cell phone. If he ever talked, it was a short comment to his companion about how hard it was to see without his glasses. He sat on the floor, and spent most of his time looking at titles. I peered over my book, and saw him move from the history section to the economics section. He continued to shuffle with his phone. He moved to the biology section, and muttered that he probably would need an “environmental ec.” textbook. He sat down on the floor, looked through titles, and looked down at his phone. I watched him through the aisles, Mullens from the back, Cabarga from the front, and Ensunsa from the register.

At 1:15pm, he stood up and began to leave. Ensunsa tried to call him back to the register, but as he turned around he spilled supplies on the floor. As she and the rest of us moved closer in to his position, the man turned around and ran out the building. He pushed his way through the bottom-floor doors of the GCC and ran out around the amphitheater to the land bridge. Mullens, Ensunsa and I ran after him, Cabarga went to sound the alarm.

He crossed the land bridge with Mullens and me following, now only twenty or so yards behind. Up the hill towards the rugby field, he began panting and slowed down. Ten yards away, we tried to yell at him to stop. He ran once again, this time to the path around the rugby field, but by then we had come by his side.

Mullens asked who he was and what he had stolen. He said he was a Reed student, a Junior who couldn’t afford his textbooks, who was scared that he would get kicked out of school. He told us his name was Jason Burns, and that his Student ID number was K00247. He looked scared and nervous. He tried to walk away, but Mullens asked him what he had stolen. He said he had stolen a Physics textbook and asked whether we thought he would be kicked out of school. Mullens tried to respond, but before she could a CSO suddenly came into view, quickly coming up the path from 28 West in our direction. The robber ran off even as we called for him to stay. The CSO was nearly at his side once he got to the other end of the rugby field. He tried to jump over the fence to evade being caught, but instead tripped, and landed on his arm, scrapping it badly. From a distance, it looked as if the CSO and Cabarga checked to see if he was injured from the fall before taking him away. They walked him down the street, presumably to 28 West, where at 1:29pm the police came and arrested him for a class C misdemeanor. He is currently unsentenced.

  I later found out that his name is not Jason Burns, that he is not a student at Reed, and that he did not in fact steal a Physics textbook. He is 29 years old, his ID has him living in a different part of Oregon altogether, and he actually stole an Economics textbook. He was on probation at the time of his current arrest. It is still unclear how he knew the format of a Reed student ID–a letter followed by five digits. It is still unclear what he intended to do with the stolen textbook.
