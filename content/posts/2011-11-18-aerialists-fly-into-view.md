Did you know about Reed’s aerial group? Because I didn’t. They perform lofty acrobatics—suspended by fabric­—high above the ground. The aerial group will now be able to host performances indoors, allowing the group to gain the student body recognition they previously lacked. Until now, the 10 or so members of the aerial group (a subset of Weapons of Mass Distraction) were relegated to the unforgiving outdoors, a situation that prevented the group from performing thanks to the unpredictable nature of Portland weather. Now, with the blessing of the Student Activities Office, an indoors aerial rig will open the door to the possibility of regular performances.

For those unfamiliar with the aerial group, its members meet on Monday from 4:30-7:30pm, Friday 1-4pm, and Saturday 3-6pm in the Quad to practice on a large blue metal structure called a rig. Tied to the rig are aerial silks, which are strong but flexible swaths of fabric that allow the aerialist to perform a variety of tricks several feet off the ground. Aerials are simultaneously technical and highly expressive. To the viewer the aerialist seems to fly through the air entirely separate from the earth while executing climbs and wraps with fluidity and grace.

The aerial group at Reed was formed in 2007 by Reed alumni Peter Schroeder ’08, Robin Zander ’08, and Jaine Powers ’09 as a subset of Weapons of Mass Distraction. By the winter of 2008 the group had obtained student funds to purchase a rig and bring it to campus. However, funds were appropriated and the rig purchased before a storage location could be found for the rig. Senate was “very insistent on the rig being stored on campus. Although they weren’t clear on where to put it,” according to mathematics major Jay Harman ’12, a member of the aerial group. As a result, the aerials group has been forced to ping pong around campus seeking storage for the rig. Temporary refuge for the rig was provided by the Association of Reed Gamers and later by the Senate Treasurers who, until this year, had allowed the aerials group to store the rig in their Gray Campus Center office. Currently, the rig resides in the Sports Center where Isabel Cylinder, the group’s signator, was able to secure a space. However, the aerials group’s woes did not stop at the storage issue.

Initially the aerial group had planned to purchase a permanent rig setup that could be constructed in the Sports Center gym. “The indoor rig would have been cheaper, safer, and better,” said Jay Harman. Nevertheless the request was denied due to a policy that makes Reed more liable for accidents that occur indoors than those that occur outdoors. As a result, aerial group members were forced to settle on the inferior outdoor rig. The topic of liability has become a constant reminder of the limitations of aerials at Reed for the group. Issues of liability require new members of the group to attend an introductory lesson at one of the few gyms in Portland that offer lessons in aerials. Consequently, the aerial group remains relatively small as prospective students shy away from attending the pricey lesson.

Recently the aerials group received a break from the SAO in the form of a change in the rules of engagement that now allows new members to circumvent the lesson so long as they first obtain instruction from a competent teacher. Most notable, though, is the change in policy that will now allow the aerials group to set up their rig indoors. Kristin Holmberg confirmed that the previous policy was overly cautious: “I don’t see any reason why Reed would be held more or less liable for hosting the rig indoors or outdoors.” With the change in policy in place, aerials will move to an indoor location and a performance is now a possibility. Increased accessibility and real performances will provide the aerials group with all the tools they need to raise student body awareness.
