“INVASION” read the signs hung all about campus the week before Friday, November 9. At 7 PM that evening, about a hundred students gathered in the SU to celebrate Mongol customs, courtesy of a combined effort from the Chinese and Russian houses.

In the first hour alone, the attendees ate an entire roast pig, hung out in a Yurt, and drank barley tea. Then, around 7:40, students broke down “The Great Wall of China”–crashing through a wall of cardboard boxes.

At 8 o’clock, Soriah, a world famous Tuvan throat singer, performed his remarkable talents. Tuvan throat singers are able to make two different tones with their voices at the same time, creating an extremely distinctive sound.

Soriah punctuated every song with a short Tuvan exclamation: “Shu!” This is roughly equivalent to “giddy up!” He went on to explain that this is because Tuvan is a horse-centric culture.

In fact, the first instrument he introduced to his concert, called an “igil,” had a horse head at the top of the neck. An igil is a string instrument, played with a bow. This igil in particular, Soriah said, was made by is Throat Singing teacher, “Silver Tongue.” Soriah told the audience that the wood from which the igil was made was taken from a tree that had washed down the river for thirty miles.

Soriah went on to sing a number of songs, ranging from a lullaby written about a mother, to a song he described as “balls out throat singing.”

After Soriah’s performance, the partygoers destroyed a giant horse-shaped piñata.
