Reed’s Commons uses disposable plastic saltshakers and peppershakers that are not recyclable and cannot be refilled. However, Bon Appétit uses reusable glass shakers at all of its other operations: Out of 25 educational institutions, 13 corporate clients, and 10 “specialty venues”, Reed’s Commons Café is the only Bon Appétit site that uses these disposables. “We’re not about this. We’re not about throwing away plastic,” says Debby Bridges, General Manager of Commons. The problem is simple: At Bon Appétit’s other cafés, people cannot bring food out of the dining area, so no one can walk off with the glass shakers. At Reed, students can eat wherever they want, and some already steal Commons’ dishes.

It boils down to expense. With freedom comes responsibility, and Reed students are not always so responsible. Commons’ saltshakers disappear and need to be replaced. Sometimes they migrate into the rain, where they are wrecked, or sometimes they migrate to dorms, never to return. Replacing glass saltshakers would only add to the cost of replacing dishes. Commons pays for up to $6,500 dollars a year for replacement dishes, and Reed covers the rest. Last year, Reed paid for $32,000 worth of replacement dishes.  In total, Commons’ dishes replacement costs were a whopping $38,000. That’s about $26.50 per student, or about 90% of one year’s tuition for a student.

Perhaps using disposable plastic shakers is an environmental travesty, but the loss of dishes (and potentially glass shakers) would represent a different kind of unsustainability. When students lose Commons’ dishes, or do not return them, they are essentially throwing them away—this is not only lazy, but also a waste of money and resources. Meanwhile, Eco-tainers, as they are called, are a means of encouraging Reedies to bring back their dishes. With each meal purchase, Eco-tainers take ¢20 off your purchase, and provide a convenient and reusable to-go container that is more reusable than a styrofoam or cardboard food box.  These benefits are intended to keep Commons’ dishes from being lost and save unnecessary expenses. Bridges hopes that more students will begin to use Eco-tainers around campus, and that they will serve as an incentive to be more responsible with dishes.

Commons is trying in other ways to maintain their efforts to be sustainable, including the installation of a new dishwasher, paid for by Reed. The school owns the major equipment in Commons’ kitchen, and, since the old dishwasher was nearing its time to be replaced, Reed decided to replace it earlier. Bridges was happy about this: “It’s nice when you work with a college where your ideas mesh so well.”  The new industrial dishwasher only pumps 90 gallons per hour into the sewer—a large improvement over the ungodly 260 gallons per hour of the old dishwasher.

However, the responsibility to be environmentally friendly is not solely that of Bon Appétit. For instance, although paper cups are available in Commons, Reedies have the option to bring their own mugs for coffee in the morning. Bridges explained that Commons has not “pursued getting mugs” because it would just be “another item Reed would have to pay for” to replace. In this case, Reedies can make decisions for themselves—Commons isn’t there to get in the way.

As for the saltshakers, glass, refillable saltshakers are clearly not currently an economically sustainable solution. So even though Commons may be using disposable saltshakers and peppershakers, Reedies’ privilege to eat wherever they choose, combined with their thefts of Commons’ dishes, are ultimately to blame.
