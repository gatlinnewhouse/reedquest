Some student groups hang around so long they become synonymous with Reed: DOTU, CAVE, RSSK. Still other groups form and dismantle on a whim, zipping in and out of existence over the years. Here is a compilation of the new groups that Reedies have managed to dream up, as well as a couple of recently established or half-dead groups attempting to gain membership.

**Fungus Among Us**

_Hunt and cultivate mushrooms._

Like  mushrooms? No, not the trippy kind. The delicious kind. Fungus among us “Breaks the mold”, hunting and cultivating mushrooms, and educating people on their health benefits, as well as the potential dangers of certain mushrooms. If you think mushrooms are mediocre, Fungus Among Us will prove you wrong! Or at least prevent you from eating the poisonous ones.

**Reed College Publishing Kollectiv (RCPK)**

_Facilitating printing of pamphlets and zines._

RCPK intends to have a space to house a small publication studio, and to be a resource for student groups that wish to publish zines, pamphlets, graphic novels, and many other forms of print media. RCPK will also have its own line of publications, including the creative writing magazine Homunculus. “A vote for RCPK is a vote for a better, more engaged Reed College,” says RCPK member Alexi Horowitz. Contact [&#x61;&#x6c;&#x68;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x77;&#x69;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][2] for more information.

**SERCAH**

_Ending rape culture at Reed._

Students for Ending Rape Culture, Assault, and Harassment (SERCAH) is a new group, but it is also a combination of students from the Sexual Assault Task Force (SATF), the Feminist Student Union&#8217;s Sexual Assault Working Group (SAWG), and Students for Sexual Assault Support Services (SSASS). These groups were responsible for the petition that circulated around Reed&#8217;s campus last year that gained 60% of the student body’s approval in a hundred hours, as well as making recommendations and advocating for change in Reed&#8217;s sexual assault policies. SERCAH is planning on working to reform Reed policies, fighting for resources for survivors, and doing as much as they can to end rape culture at Reed.

**Reed Film Society**

_Watch movies, eat popcorn._

As CAVE has shown us, sometimes the best Reed groups have the simplest goals. The Reed film society likes popcorn and movies, and they provide access to both of them in plentiful quantity. Although the Reed film society is not a new group, they have had little activity in the past couple years, so now is a great time to join their mailing list, [&#x66;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x6d;&#x73;&#x6f;&#x63;&#x69;&#x65;&#x74;&#x79;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][4], and get watching those movies.

** ****Nothing But Flowers**

_Compost stuff, make it into flowers for stressed seniors._** **

Sean Howard wants to bring joy into the lives of Reedies, using flowers. Specifically, he wants to grow potted flowers from compost made of Commons leftovers. “In the past, the administration has not really trusted students to take care of composting,” said Howard. “I hope to change their minds.” Once the flowers have been grown, seniors will get the first flowers, as their lives have been drained of all other forms of beauty. Email Sean Howard at [&#x73;&#x68;&#x6f;&#x77;&#x61;&#x72;&#x64;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][5] if you are interested in helping him, contributing compost, acquiring flowers, or simply to show your support.

**Mock Trial**

_Practice being a lawyer._

MOCK TRIAL! You know what it is. Two attorneys, including a Reed alum, will coach the team, which will attend two invitationals. Contact Allie Hemming at [&#x61;&#x68;&#x65;&#x6d;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][6] if you are interested.

**Massage Party**

_Give and receive massages._

Massage party is a great group for those who are tired of giving and not getting back (unless you&#8217;re at the back of the massage train, I suppose). Massage Party&#8217;s role on campus is to provide a “social, relaxed” environment for the giving and receiving of massages, as well as the sharing of massage techniques. Contact Eleanor Kinney at [&#x6b;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x79;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][7] if you interested.

**Cylco-Cross Team**

_Biking+Cross Country=Awesome._

Cyclo-Cross is a form of bicycle racing that involves rough terrain that you must dismount from your bike and circumvent, while carrying your bike. Hardcore. Contact [&#x6a;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x64;&#x72;&#x69;&#x67;&#x75;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][8] if you are interested.

**Sky Appreciation Club**

_Appreciating the sky._

“We are a club interested in facilitating veneration of the sky,” says Sophmore Ryan Butcher. Sky Appreciation Club will make weekly trips to Mount Tabor Park to appreciate the sunset. Butcher is acquiring knowledge of astronomy, and his co-signator Alaia Giglio is a cloud “aficianado”, but the group’s primary purpose is to appreciate the sky and sunsets. Root beer floats may also be involved. Hopefully they get lots of trips in before the rainy season hits. Email [&#x72;&#x62;&#x75;&#x74;&#x63;&#x68;&#x65;&#x72;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][9] if you are interested.

**Fishing Club**

_Going fishing, catching fish._

Apparently, catching stickleback in the Canyon isn&#8217;t good enough for some people. Fishing Club is a group that wants to use student body funds to provide fishing equipment and licenses for students, as well as transportation to places to fish. Fishing Club, given enough money, would want to take a charter out on the Willamette for fishing. Contact Wyatt Alt at [&#x77;&#x79;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][10].

**Motorcycle Co-Op**

_Keeping motorcycles healthy._

Bike Co-Op repairs and tunes up bikes. Motorcycle Co-Op does the same thing, except with motorcycles. Sounds pretty cool. ****Contact [&#x63;&#x74;&#x68;&#x6f;&#x6d;&#x66;&#x6f;&#x72;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][11] for more info.
