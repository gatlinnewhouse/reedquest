There is nothing better than a good dive bar. Except, of course, when gunplay breaks out in a good dive bar, or when you manage to entrap young women in a good dive bar. In my opinion, the dive is the best kind of drinking establishment because it needs so very little to be great: cheap beer; strong, cheap drinks; games of some sort; good happy hour deals; and bartenders who are neither inattentive dicks nor hovering and over-attentive.

A good jukebox is a bonus, as is good food (although I do have to give props to the bars who only serve “food” like Tombstone frozen pizzas because the law says they have to, and will direct you to a more food-centric establishment if you’re really hungry).

Other frills—menus printed on swanky résumé paper in Georgia or Big Caslon with no dollar signs next to the prices, mood lighting, cocktails featuring “house-made infusions”—have their time and place. I mean, I enjoy a foofy, pretentious cocktail as much as the next young lady, but my heart belongs to the dive bar.

Each week, I will strive to find the diviest dives you ever dove and bring you a neat, compact summation of my travels.

Author’s Note: This should go without saying, but it can’t hurt to spell it out: don’t attempt to frequent these establishments unless you are actually 21. Just don’t, okay?
  
The OLCC (Oregon Liquor Control Commission) is really strict, and pretty much every bar I’ve been to checks IDs with a blacklight. Your precious fake will be taken away, chopped into itty-bitty pieces, and I will sit on my high, 21-year-old horse and laugh at you.

Oh, how I love the Ship. It is very near and dear to my heart. It’s dark; it’s open, like, all the time; it’s laid-back; and best of all, drinks are cheap ($3.00-$3.50 drinks depending on time of day, and beer is $2.50-$4.00 a pint, depending on type and time).

The Ship does not serve food that you actually want to eat, but does let you bring takeout from C-Bar across the street and eat it inside, which is an unusually cool policy.

Furthermore, the beer selection is way better than average for a dive-y place and they have FOUR pinball machines (at last count: Whitewater, World Cup Soccer, Attack from Mars, and my personal favorite, Dr. Who). There is no change machine, but a bartender will more than happily swap your cash for quarters. A pool table, Big Buck Hunter, and video poker round out the entertainment. There’s also an electronic jukebox (i.e., internet-based), which is definitely not as cool as a real jukebox, but you can play pretty much whatever you want.

All the bartenders pour heavy, and if you’re nice to them, they’ll be nice to you—which is how everything should work, anyways.
