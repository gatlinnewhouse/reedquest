Last weekend, Stephen Bennett’s thesis show, James Joyce’s The Dead, opened at Reed College Mainstage Theatre. Directed by Darrin J. Pufall, the production is a smashing success complete with 15 musical numbers, an impeccable mise-en-scène, and spectacular performances by the entire cast.

Bennett leads the cast as Gabriel Conroy, a Dubliner who, throughout the course of his aunts’ annual Christmas-time party, comes to accept his heritage and realize the frailty of the human condition.

Bennett’s performance is poignant without being syrupy, and his timing is flawless, if his accent sometimes wavering. Allie Cislo plays Gabriel’s wife, Gretta. Cislo and Bennett’s performance during The Dead’s final scenes are the production’s best.

Ananya Kepper, who plays the fierce nationalist Miss Molly Ivors, Tristan Nieto, who plays the rebellious Freddy Malins, and Kathleen Worley, who plays Aunt Julia Morkan, all provide exceptional performances as well.

The songs in The Dead, far from typical show tunes, range from jaunty drinking chanteys to haunting arias. “Wake the Dead” is the musical’s most theatrical number. Led by a tipsy Freddy Malins (Nieto), the song is an uproarious, foot-stompin’ celebration of good cheer. Aunt Julia (Kathleen Worley) steals the show with “Naughty Girls,” a mischievous little ditty exploring a reformed choirgirl’s coy sexuality. Other standouts include the elegiac “Michael Furey” sung by Gretta Conroy (Cislo) and “Kate Kearney” a romping tune led by schoolboy Michael (Walker Holden).

The live accompaniment provided by John Vergin (piano/harp), Emma Farley (violin), Haley Jacobson (cello), Sara MacQueen (flute), and Will Hattman (percussion) are indispensable to the production, and their ability to segue from genre to genre is particularly impressive.

It would have been nice to hear more of Andrew Brown’s voice in the production, but his character’s “D’Arcy’s Aria” is perhaps the best technically executed number in The Dead.

Kristeen Willis Crosser’s set design is exceptionally effective as the production transitions from the large main area to two intimate bedroom nests, and Pufall’s costume design has everyone dressed to the nines – Molly’s gown and cropped jacket, and Freddy’s plaid suit and red bowtie looked particularly dapper.

_You can (read: should) see The Dead November 11, 12, and 13 at 7:30 at the Reed College Mainstage Theatre. Tickets are $2 for Reed community members and $6 general admission._
