This week’s subby is a quicky but goodie.

Surely, by now, you’ve seen Rebecca Black’s  YouTube gem “Friday” and its subsequent parodies (if not, I would highly recommend watching before continuing reading). It’s terrible, and we all know it. And yet, I really don’t understand what the fuss is all about. Yes, “Friday” is the culmination of everything detestable about horrifically generic teen pop. But is it really that surprisingly bad?

What I mean to say is that while “Friday” is, indeed, the gold standard of horrific, there is a lot of  shit out there that is just as uninspired and derivative: shit that is made to cater to the Disney big wigs responsible for Hannah Montana, Ashley Tisdale, and other tweenpop sensations. But unlike the aforementioned, this shit often lacks the talent and pop aesthetic necessary for Disney stardom. Which is exactly why it’s shit. Namely, Disney shit.

So what constitutes “Disney shit”? As you’ve probably already guessed, Disney shit necessitates a vocalist fresh out of puberty. Said vocalist doesn’t really have to know how to sing; auto-tune can (and most certainly) will take care of that. Disney shit also requires shitty production value that aims at a synthy dance-pop sound, but fails entirely. Stir in some non-sensiscal lyrics, and hot damn, you’ve got a stew going. The proof is in the recommendations below. Make sure you watch the accompanying videos with all of these.
