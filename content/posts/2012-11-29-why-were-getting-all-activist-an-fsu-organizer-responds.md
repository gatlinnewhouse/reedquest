**_TW: sexual assault, racism, misogyny, detailed discussion of triggering & emotional harm._**

This article addresses the closing question, posed by Sal Rodriguez, in the [_Quest_ article about his performance on Nov. 17][1]. As a member of FSU, I immediately mobilized around Sal’s act because his words caused immediate and dire harm to survivors and allies at Reed by triggering many people who both saw and heard about the show. During a support workshop in the Women’s Center on Nov. 19 a dozen people met to seek mutual support, but we also worked to craft a cogent response to Sal’s actions. As was discussed, it is now clear that many people at Reed are still gravely undereducated about harm reduction and trauma.

According to RAINN (the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network), [1 out of 6 women and 1 out of 33 men][2] has experienced attempted or successful sexual assault in the US. There are currently [1,455 students enrolled at Reed][3], meaning that there are likely around 130 female-identifying and 20 male-identifying sexual assault survivors at Reed. Ten percent of our population is at increased risk for serious psychological hardship from sexual assault alone.

As such, this article responds to Sal’s question by explaining what trauma, re-traumatization, and triggering are and entail. I take my definitions from Nina Kammerer and Ruta Mazelis’ 2006 article, “[After the Crisis: Trauma and Re-Traumatization][4].” The two emphasize specifically that _trauma does not only come from sexual or physical assault_. As such, all mention of trauma and triggering in this article includes racism despite the fact that such language has yet to be widely applied to the lived experience of people who have been subjected to racist aggression.

As Kammerer & Mazelis note, “Rather than as trauma once again, retraumatization should be understood as trauma yet again, with this ‘yet again’ likely to be again and again…” This ‘yet again’ is what Reed needs to shift its focus to—especially because, for many people who are attacked here, it isn’t for the first time. Having had this lived experience myself, what I see as the fundamental flaw in discussion around Sal’s performance is the extent to which the emerging narrative prioritizes students’ rights to say whatever they want, wherever they want, and neglects the right of all students to feel safe at this school. Allowing dialogue about Saturday’s performance to center on Sal’s right to speak freely turns him into a martyr of a crusade that doesn’t exist.

In rebuttal, it has been noted that students were free to leave the SU at any time and that the (few) posters hung around campus bore a warning of “offensive material.” While it is true that people could have left Sal’s performance, creating a situation that requires swift exit due to feelings of immanent harm is still grossly negligent. It is also very different from being “offensive.”

Again, the issue is not that Sal’s bit wasn’t funny, or that people didn’t “like” it. Triggering has absolutely nothing to do with aesthetic judgment. It is brutal physiological pain, which includes the sudden incursion or exacerbation of any adverse symptoms associated with trauma, such as “dissociation, flashbacks, and nightmares…[but also] depression, anxiety and panic…obsessive-compulsive…[and/or] psychotic disorders” (Kammerer & Mazelis). Because a survivor is likely to experience many more episodes of triggering in their lifetime than immediate violence, on a day-to-day basis _avoiding triggering actually becomes much more central to the quality of many survivor’s lives_ than avoiding directly abusive contact. To me, behaving honorably at Reed means considering this fact.

From my experience at Reed, it seems that many students worry that being asked to avoid triggering behavior will limit their ability to speak freely. Unfortunately, there is no universal metric for triggers; this why, rather than censoring student speech, we need to encourage compassion on the ground, and on an institutional level enable students to call out triggering or hurtful behavior when it does arise in a protected, supported, and _respected_ way.

We are all here because we have so much potential—to be brilliant, constructive, lovely, and whole. Attacking one another as Sal did on Saturday seriously undermines our ability to be all of these things, both as individuals and as a community. Experiences like this access our potential and force our community to grow in necessary ways, but the tragedy of this situation is that someone will always be harmed by the violence inherent in such force. As a community, we owe those harmed by Sal’s performance accountability, and we owe them transformation. Influencing what Sal thinks is not my aim—but improving the standards of what our community will tolerate is. I will never advocate against free speech, but I will advocate changing the debate towards something that is actually in jeopardy: the right of all students to exist happily, safely, and equitably at Reed.
