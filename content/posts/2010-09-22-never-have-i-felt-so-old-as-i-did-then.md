They swarmed like flies around the half-consumed corpse of a cow, downing cheap beer and making eyes ineffectively at one another in hope of emotionless trysts. I’ve spent a number of gorgeous, ridiculous nights at comparable events, but on Saturday there was no there there. All we had to show were disconnected, ineffectual smiles and failed conversations.

And this isn’t about the party’s organization or theme — it was a birthday party and the birthday girl lived it up — Reedies, I am ashamed for us. That was the first night I have felt truly old, like I-saw-Abraham-bind-Isaac fucking old. I craved madness and shouting, but spent most of the night on the porch with a friend while making snarky comments about all the freshmen we couldn’t recognize. I felt like a stranger in my own home.

Because we destroyed that house my freshman year. When I stumbled upon the first party there I was stunned by the wealth of tight, sparkly clothing and the rampaging pop music. Those dancing tore up the side room with outrageous moves. Perhaps the mists of memory have clouded my mind, but all I saw last Saturday was composed mostly of awkward shuffling and slight hip thrusts.

Where is the wild abandon that once filled our bodies? Have we given up on ourselves, on our ability to do more than mercilessly pound literature into our heads?

So I retire. I quit. I’m hanging up my neon leggings and retreating to the mountains to meditate on weekends. Every hope I had of enjoying myself on Reed’s campus has been boxed up and packed away — you’ll only see me here when I’m grumpy and upset, churning away at problem sets and Max Weber’s Economy and Society. I want no part of half-hearted smiles and empty buildings. I would prefer to spend my life in the company of a few close friends rather than face the facades that hide your hollowness.

This is why seniors look grumpy and disillusioned. It’s not the workload or the post-graduation black hole. We’ve lost faith and tossed aside any desire that our institution be more than the aggregation of manically-stressed students. Faced with morbid images of something I loved, I have buried myself so deeply in books that I cannot see out.

Yet escape from this repugnant world is only possible if we wake up and take a hard look in the mirror. We must either risk constant upset and disappointment or wither quietly in our rooms. Take a deep breath and look back — remember those nights you fell head over heels, and use them to make something fresh and new. Hope still waits in the wings.
