Reedies, while brilliant and lovely people, tend towards being socially inept in some form or another. Consider this a complimentary guide to avoiding some serious awkwardness during your more romantic endeavors.**
  
** 

 **“Birthday Sex” – Jeremih**
  
Because, really, does it matter if it’s your birthday or not? Paris Hilton once said that “you should live every day like it’s your birthday.” Normally we’re not too crazy about P. Hilton’s advice, but we’ll make an exception in this case.

**“Push” – Enrique Iglesias**
  
Complete with heavy breathing, growling, and Enrique’s super-sexy accent, this jam will turn up the heat from “okay” to “OMG!”**
  
** 

**“The Stroke” – Billy Squire**
  
This is a classic. It’s perfect for the down-and-dirty, hair tossing moments…and it’s practically foolproof. In fact, it may inspire some unexpected carnal behavior. You will not regret this choice in the least.

**“Buttons” – Pussycat Dolls**
  
Honestly? Nothing gets your clothes off faster. They are literally instructing you to remove your shirt. How you do that is totally up to you, but I guarantee you’ll be wearing a whole lot less after the first fifty seconds…

**“Neighbors Know My Name” – Trey Songz**
  
Seriously. We all know that the walls in, like, all the dorms are super-thin. At least you’ll be owning your noise with this song. You might even get a high-five the next morning from a particularly impressed dormie. Or you might find a hateful, passive-aggressive sticky note on your door. Whatever.

**BONUS:
  
** 

**“I Will Always Love You” – Whitney Houston**
  
This is strictly post-coital. It is effective in one of two ways: you will either have a great laugh with your significant other over the silly cliché that is this overplayed (but glorious) song, or you will get rid of a particularly clingy one-night stand in the blink of an eye. Either way, you win.
