Last Thursday generated a lot of stories: speeches were given, slogans were chanted, and somewhere along the way naked freshmen crowded into a U-Haul and streaked the Lewis & Clark Library.

Most of that isn’t noteworthy – this shit has happened at Reed for far longer than the three years I’ve been here. But that night something innovative happened. As the freshmen spray-painted their white clothes in red patterns, red, white, and blue lights came on the SU porch. Gigantic speakers blasted the “The Star-Spangled Banner” across the quad, and all were stunned. As the guitar ended its patriotic song, a hush came across the space. A voice came on.

Last week I was wrong. Demoralized, I claimed that the underclassmen were all lifeless machines, beings that knew not how to dance or truly live. As such, I resigned to studying crankily in the library away from constant disappointment. Based on vague recollections of my own freshman year, I argued that this current crop of Reedies couldn’t party with the wild abandon I once knew. Yet along the way I forgot one crucial detail: We had leaders who indoctrinated us and showed us the way.

The speech that rang from those speakers was carefully arranged and orchestrated, full of rhetorical chicanery. I can’t claim to know what exactly was said, but somewhere in there I heard declarations that RKSK was no radical body, but only a puppet of the administration. What the demagogue said isn’t important; rather, it is key that he spoke. For the first time, bystanders took part in initiation. Though we sat on the sidelines, he gave us voice and expanded the event beyond its narrow slogan-chanting and library streaking.

This sort of thing doesn’t happen. Thought, planning, and manpower went into this; someone rolled those speakers out there, wrote that speech, and filled all those water balloons. My guess is that they were upperclassmen.

In the party I mentioned last week, underclassmen weren’t the only ones present.

No, there were Reedies with experience on the dance floor. The DJ, the two arguing over obscure philosophy on the porch, the guy that danced so hard you couldn’t bring yourself to stop him; they were all juniors and seniors.

We still have a place here! No matter how goddamn jaded you feel, you can’t let this place go. If you resign yourself to the cloistered life of books and papers there will be no one to teach the young ones how to live. I know that I didn’t get here on my own; along the way I had mentors and friends that opened doors and pointed me to opportunities.

The Revolutionary Youth Brigade’s speech came to an end, and the spray-painted masses marched away in column, chanting ‘We Have No Name.” The groups will likely squabble in the days ahead, but it doesn’t matter. The important thing is that for a moment, as Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA” roared from the speakers, we were more than aggregated individuals. Prompted by a nameless demagogue and a few dedicated organizers, we acted collectively. We became more than ourselves.

In three years the freshmen will be seniors; who will they look to as they navigate their new lives in this institution? Certainly not the grumpy, stinky Reedies they’ve only seen in the library. Put down your books, hoist up your boombox, and show ‘em how it’s done.
