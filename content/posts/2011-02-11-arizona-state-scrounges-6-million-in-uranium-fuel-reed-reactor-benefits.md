_ASU’s Defunct Reactor Program Supplies Reed with Used Fuel_

Last month, the Reed College Research Reactor received roughly 6 million dollars worth of new uranium fuel elements. “This is easily the most significant event in the history of the reactor since it first went critical in 1968,” said Stephen Frantz, Reactor Director.

The 91 stainless steel clad fuel elements delivered to Reed were going to be discarded after Arizona State University shut down their reactor program last year. Frantz, however, was able to convince the US Department of Energy to instead use them to replace the 64 aluminum clad fuel elements that had been used at Reed since the start of the reactor program in 1968.

The new stainless steal clad elements are much stronger than their aluminum clad counterparts. As soft-shelled aluminum clad elements had begun to leak, they had to be taken out of service and eventually the reactor was unable to run at full power. “Reed needed more fuel, but new fuel is almost impossible to obtain. This will enable us to operate and fulfill our mission for many more decades,” said Frantz.

Since being hired as Reactor Director 16 years ago, Frantz had secured a number of new elements for the Reed reactor, but nothing on this scale. Because the Reed reactor is non-profit, it relies on the Department of Energy to supply its fuel elements. Frantz explained that the difficulty in obtaining new fuel elements depended on the priority given to larger research schools like MIT, the price of new elements – roughly 67 thousand apiece – and the fact that used elements are radioactive.

Frantz described the situation as “win-win-win”: by giving the fuel to Reed instead of sending it to be disposed, ASU was able to dispose of their material and the Department of Energy could provide Reed with the fuel it needed. “The fuel was headed for disposal in the waste stream at Idaho which is the normal course for even partially used reactor fuel.
  
We convinced the US Department of Energy to send it to Reed instead. This fuel is in much better condition than our fuel and it made more sense to dispose of our fuel instead of the Arizona fuel,” said Frantz, “It was just a matter of convincing people it’s worth the extra paperwork.”

Frantz commended the student reactor operators on their work during the delivery of the new fuel elements, as did the government officials involved. “The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy were impressed by our students and the job they did. They complemented us on the students’ professionalism, skill, and hard work,” said Frantz.

Frantz said he is happy to have accomplished obtaining new fuel for the reactor before his retirement at the end of the year.
