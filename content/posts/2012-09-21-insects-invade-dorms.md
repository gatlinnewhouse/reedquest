On-campus residences are dealing with a new nuisance. Living halls like Canyon House, Aspen, Sitka, ODB, and the Birchwood Apartments have had encounters with ants, bed bugs, and silverfish. Wasp&#8217;s nests have been found on dorms across campus.

“I’m not bothered by [them]. I’m bothered by the fact that they are there,” says Paloma Martinez-Miranda ’16.

For the most part, the insects are only minor nuisances in students’ lives. An Aspen resident who requested anonymity says, “I nearly ate some food that was left over with ants on it when I was drunk one night.” Students and faculty had a meeting in the dorm’s kitchen during O-Week, he explains, and left their food unattended for several nights. Fortunately for Aspen’s residents, the ants did not take up permanent residence within the dorm.

Michele McPherson, the administrative coordinator of facilities services at the Physical Plant, and a team of exterminators help the college remain bug free when it remains essential. “Bed bugs, wasps, any stinging animal where someone might be allergic to it, we take care of it immediately,” says McPherson. “If it’s a nuisance, it’s taken care of when Saul, the pest control guy, comes in every other week.” Wasps are particularly common around campus, especially near light fixtures. A Canyon House resident reported a wasp&#8217;s nest on the dorm’s porch late last week. “It was taken care of later [that] afternoon,” McPherson says.

Though students can’t do much about wasps or ants, McPherson says that reporting nests and tossing away unfinished foods promptly can help control the spread of unwanted critters. But it’s unlikely that bothersome insects will ever stop bugging Reedies. “They’re a nuisance,” says McPherson.
