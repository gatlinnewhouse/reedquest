In his first year at Reed, Director of Community Safety Gary Granger has spent a lot of time repeatedly emphasizing one point: communication with him and/or his CSO staff will help ease students’ concern about CSO engagement. If you don’t communicate with them, there’s no way Gary will be able to know how you feel. However, as you can see from the picture, and from across campus this past week, some unknown students have found a way to reach out to Gary that he didn’t initially expect.

“I love the posters. I love the fact that instead of calling for my resignation, the [students who made the poster] are looking forward to seeing me in April,” says Granger.

Granger recognizes that this certain form of satire has been circulated to critique how his staff has been taking down the names of students they find infracting the school’s alcohol and drug policies, but Gary has no intention of looking for the individual(s) who put up the posters and confronting them.

“If the person who put up the sign wanted to personally talk to me about what motivated him or her to do it, I’d be more than happy to do that. But I have zero interest in trying to find out who put the signs up…I’m really not worried about it,” says Granger.

Though the sign appears to have caused no serious consequences, the _Quest_ has recently received information that, if verified, could have serious ramifications on the CSO staff. Rumors of “unethical CSO Behavior” have reached the _Quest_ Office, with no further information about CSOs involved or what sort of behavior this could entail. Granger wishes this information would have gone directly to him.

“If a community member knew about unethical behavior by a CSO, they could take it to the J Board and I wouldn’t even have to know. I don’t think that’s smart because ultimately if the J Board found a problem, or anybody found a problem with the CSOs, the only person who could fix it and be responsible [for] it is me. So from whatever root it came, it will always end up landing on my desk. So I just say to the community, ‘bring it to my desk first.’ And if you don’t like the way that I deal with it, all those options are still open. You can still go knock on Colin’s door, you can still go see Mike Brody, and you can still file an Honor Council Case.”

Granger notes that there is a possibility that the circulation of such a rumor has occurred because of unhappiness about his and his staff’s implementation of the AOD policy. To try to deal with this problem, Granger, along with Dean of Student Services Mike Brody and Associate Dean of Student and Campus Life Peter Meagher, will lead discussions in each of the residential area groups and one in the SU for off-campus students. The topic: drug and alcohol policy and AOD implementation plan. The goal is to facilitate frank and honest discussions about the policy and how it is being dealt with this year.

“The meetings have gone great. I feel like anytime Reed students have an opportunity to discuss what’s on their mind, especially vis-à-vis policy and implementation, it’s a worthwhile use of time. Some of the discussions have been heated, and generally all the better because of it. People are expressing their opinions and I think they’re expressing them honestly, so I think it’s been good.”

Four more meetings are set to take place before the end of the semester. Brody, Granger and Meagher are hopeful that such meetings will increase school-wide understanding of the policy and hopefully encourage students to be more honest and open with the CSOs. Such behavior can be incredibly important for community safety at times. As noted in this year’s 11th issue of the _Quest_ in the CSO Blotter, friends of a student who had an “adverse reaction” to cocaine went to the CSOs to make sure the student was all right. The CSOs performed a medical evaluation and were able to deal with the problem.

“We will not deal with cocaine much differently that we would deal with marijuana. It’s not what our plan would call a hard drug, like heroine or meth, but it certainly can be more serious on the reactions than what can happen with marijuana. I’ll follow the implementation plan guidelines.”

Communicating with the CSOs directly has proven to facilitate understanding about issues and Gary continuously encourages such behavior. You can contact Gary at his 28 West Office or on his blog at [http://blogs.reed.edu/reed\_blogs/community\_safety/][1]{.broken_link}.
