Beginning this semester, we’ve decreased printing fees by 20 percent, lowering the cost from 10 cents to eight cents per side. Wait, what? Can that be right? In this economy, with prices rising for… everything?

Ever since Reede was Olde, printing has been charged at 10¢ per side. Why change it now?
  
Well, there are a couple of reasons. One of the biggest complaints we’ve heard in the past has been, “Hey, don’t charge me so much for printing, you dirty so-and-so.” At long last, we are able to make it happen.

At the help desk we occasionally see students printing jobs 2-up or 4-up or even-more-up. I’m not talking about video games here. I’m talking about printing multiple “pages” per sheet of paper, with type so small that even your young eyes couldn’t possibly read it. Some folks print this way to save money; others are simply being green. If we can ease some eye strain by charging less, it’s probably worth it.

Okay, but what’s the catch? Have you just been spending the printing money on ponies and lollipops? No, no, no, CUS hasn’t purchased a pony in years (we prefer to lease).
  
Revenue from printing is first used to cover the cost of printers, supplies and maintenance, then it goes towards evening help desk coverage by your friendly t-watchers. Money from printing is also used to increase the speed with which we can replace IRC and library lab computers. With less revenue coming from printing fees we may need to extend the life of these computers, but we’ll just have to wait and see how that works out.

Well, that’s my 2¢. (Now it’s yours!)
