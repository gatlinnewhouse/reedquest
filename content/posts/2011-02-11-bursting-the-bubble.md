**Entertainment:** 

• Lindsay Lohan is on trial for stealing a $2,500 necklace. Also this week: an 80-year-old Floridian woman was arrested and sentenced to five years jail time for stealing a ring worth $9,000. Way to get shown up by a senior citizen, Lindsanity. At least grandma knew that you either go big or go home.

• The White Stripes broke up, for good. Really, they mean it this time. But if true, it’s quite sad… for Meg. Last time I checked, Jack has about 230498320948 billion other bands. Dude will be around for a while.

•Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, Julie Taymor’s $65 million project, is currently regarded as Broadway’s biggest flop. The only good thing to come out of this disaster of a musical, apparently, is a YouTube video entitled “Spider-Man Reviews in Color” that uses the worst of the negative review pull quotes set to an old-school Spider-Man cartoon soundtrack. It is guaranteed to make your day.

• The Black Eyed Peas sucked at the Super Bowl. Like, really, really bad. There was even a moment when Slash came out and started the guitar solo introduction for “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” which was a nice relief from the awful mess that was BEP. But then Fergie started to sing, and we were all reminded that nothing good in life ever lasts.

**U.S.:**

• New York representative Chris Lee resigned after Gawker reported that he had been sending flirtatious emails and shirtless photos of himself to a woman he met through Craigslist personals (uh, sketch much?). For the record, he is HOT for an old guy. If he’s lucky, he’ll get his own show on CNN.

• Smoking is banned in New York parks and beaches! And public plazas like Times Square and Union Square, too. It’s sparked a nationwide movement to make smoking a whole lot tougher. SUCK IT, BIG TOBACCO! Apparently, a study conducted among non-smokers in New York revealed 57% had toxins in their lungs that are associated with secondhand smoke. Of course, you inhale a LOT of shit in New York, so if the secondhand smoke doesn’t get you, the exhaust totally will. Bet they didn’t test for that.

• Bristol Palin said in an interview that she will “probably” run for office in the future. P.S. She’s got a memoir coming out. Like mother, like daughter&#8230;

• A 20-year-old British tourist in the U.S. died from poor plastic surgery techniques when she received silicon injections into her buttocks. The procedure was carried out by an unlicensed person in a Philadelphia motel. Moral of the story: if you wanna get more junk in your trunk, make sure you’re getting it done at, like, a medical facility. 

• Bad weather’s sweeping the nation, and now it’s powering through the Southeast. At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, crews struggled to keep the runways clear. Imagine that! Blizzards in the south. 

**World:**

• Egypt, motherfuckers. If you don’t know what’s going on, you are an ignorant skid mark on the underpants of humanity. Or you just don’t care. Either way, you make me sad.

• Pirates captured a U.S.-bound Greek oil supertanker off the Oman coast. Uncool. Pirates suck, unless they are like Jack Sparrow. In that case, they are very cool.

• Electoral officials in Southern Sudan published results from January’s historic referendum on independence, which confirmed that nearly 99% of people voted for separation from the north and creation of a new country. New independent nation is a go! Hooray!

**Science & Technology:**

• A federally-funded study released on February 9th publicized results that revealed that performing surgery on babies with severe spina bifida while still in the womb doubles the chance that they will be able to walk. So awesome!

• R.I.P. Guitar Hero. Activision announced the dissolution of their GH unit this past week. We all know Rock Band is where it’s at, though.

• Reports show that sales of Android phones went up 888.8% in 2010. That is a LOT. 

• The Verizon iPhone was released to mixed response. Rumor has it that Apple has been waiting for the Verizon phone to circulate for a while before announcing the iPad 2. Exciting!

PDX:**

• A local mom has filed a $734,000 wrongful death lawsuit against the Multnomah Education Service District. Her special needs son, Christopher Tyler, died two days after choking on a hamburger. Tyler, 18, required close supervision at mealtimes, and school instructors were given specific instructions to ensure that Tyler was eating safely. This protocol was obviously not adhered to, and unfortunately resulted in Tyler being left on life support with no chances of recovery. His life support was removed on December 10th. Hopefully, this will be a wake-up call to school districts around the state, and across the nation – accidents like this should never happen.

• JetBlue announced new nonstop flights from Portland to Boston. Congratulations, you Bostonians! You can space out to TV for five hours in-flight. And you get those yummy blue chips. Love those.

• Powell’s announced that declining book sales (thanks, Kindle/iPad/Nook) have forced them to lay off employees. Interesting fact: most of Powell’s profits come from its online sales. That’s right, PDX’s pride and joy is floating on out-of-state monies! It’s okay if you feel like your whole life is a lie now. For the record, the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny aren’t real, either.

• Yay! A second H&M opened up in Portland on February 10th. (I love how this somehow qualifies as news. It’s an H&M. Get real.)
