Wiggle your toes, then take a look outside. Aren’t you glad you’re cozy inside, with a good pair of socks to protect your extremities from the cold and wet when you do venture outdoors?

Hate to be the nag, but not everyone has either the luxury of staying indoors this winter, or for that matter, wearing that delightful article of clothing known as socks. Street outreach organizations like the one myself and many Reedies are a part of, Yellow Brick Road, make a point of delivering socks on our nightly rounds to supply basic first aid and harm reduction supplies to the Portland street population. Socks provide and simple yet wonderful relief to the homeless population: sturdy socks aren’t an item you can typically pick up secondhand, and for a population that is both outside and always on their feet, new ones, when afforded, wear out far quickly.

Unfortunately, socks are both the most requested item, and the one we run out the most frequently.

Per person, they’re also prohibitively expensive, and when you’re dealing with upwards of fifty people a night who need items that vary from bleach kits to dog food to Q-tips to soap to toothbrushes to condoms to matches,  all while on a shoestring budget made of a patchwork of federal, state and local grants and private donations&#8230; it’s hard to make ends meet. As a result, street outreach volunteers are told during training to never bring more than three or four pair out per volunteer on a shift.

After handing out our limited supplies, the accusation plagues us throughout the night, sometimes with a few choice expletives, sometimes with just a sigh: “You’re always out of socks.” But, there’s not a whole lot we can do, other than attempt to honor other requests for supplies, be they for antibiotic cream or alcohol swabs, safety pins or sewing needles.

However, there is something you can do to help. Reed Yellow Brick Road volunteers are putting together a sock drive for the month of December as a contest between area groups. Each area group will have a box for donations placed in Commons, along with a box placed in the library for off-campus folks; by the end of this semester, the area group who donates the most socks will receive a pizza party, compliments of Res Life. Socks will also be collected at the Staff & Faculty Holiday Party on December 20th.

So, while a small gesture, please consider giving the gift of socks this Christmas. Everyone should be able to have warm toes this season, right?
