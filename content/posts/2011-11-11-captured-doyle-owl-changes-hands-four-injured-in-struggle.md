The Doyle Owl has new owners. After a long fight Saturday night, the Owl was eventually taken by a team made up of various members of Frisbee and PIG dorm. A high-speed chase ensued. According to one student involved in the chase, a silver mid-2000&#8217;s Honda CRV had the owl in it, three cars pursued that car, then the owl car was joined by a blue Honda Civic as backup in the event of a confrontation. The Owl was carried towards Mount Hood. The chasers had to give up around 2:00 AM when the road became too icy for them to continue. Wherever the Owl has been taken, it will remain there until the owners decide to bring it back out, or it is stolen in the dead of night.

The Doyle Owl was set to appear on “a front lawn near you,” but it was not made clear which front lawn. So hundreds of students convened in front of ODB, wearing warpaint, carrying hand carts, buzzing with excitement, only to find that the Owl was not there.

At about 9:10, students were led into a grove of trees on the front lawn by a signal firework. However, it soon became apparent that the Owl was not there. Another firework went off, near the student center. It would later be apparent that this firework was set off over the Blue Bridge; however, it was not initially obvious where the firework had come from, so people began to gather in front of Winch, looking confused.

A white car sped into Eliot Circle, and students followed it. It was unclear what exactly this car was doing, but it clearly did not have the Owl in it. It could have just been an unfortunate parent. While the car was leaving, a couple of students wandered around, shoving a camera phone in people&#8217;s faces, saying, “why is everybody over here? The Owl&#8217;s at Bragdon!” Sure enough, there was the owl, covered in gold paint, mud, and barbed wire.

As people realized where the Owl was, they began to filter over the Blue Bridge, although many students remained on the south side. A smoke bomb was placed at the north side of the bridge; however, a student who was irritated by it gave it a swift kick and it went speeding into the canyon. According to Gary Granger, students were telling other students that the owl at Bragdon was a fake, and the real owl was on the south lawn. This tactic, though admirably sneaky, was only a stall: By 9:40 the south side of campus was dead quiet.  At first, there were perhaps twenty people around the owl, which was covered in barbed wire (which was quickly removed) and mud. One team kept trying to load it onto their handcart, but it kept falling off: The whole lawn around Bragdon had been hosed down, and had become slick with mud that seemed to verge on ice. Rented U-hauls lingered in the Bragdon parking lot, waiting for their team to get the advantage. As per usual, people entered the owl fight to touch, kiss, and rub their genitals against the owl. (Thankfully, due to the low temperatures, the latter occurred infrequently at most). Occasional fights and impromptu wrestling matches broke out on the fringes. In the words of Granger, these people were occasionally “overenthusiastic” but he noted that “the crowd reels them in pretty quickly.”

Four students were injured in the owl fight. According to Granger, three of these were head injuries, one of which required a call for Emergency Medical Assistance, but no medical transport was necessary. The other one was a cut from barbed wire, which Granger described as a “bad idea.” Granger noted that students were “amazingly cooperative” when they moved for the EMS response, and afterwards the fight resumed.

In the words of Granger, “The Owl abides.”
