_Community Members Restore Reed Nature Preserve_

**Julia Lee**

Georgia Baker and Lea Burke, nine-year-old girl scouts clad in power-blue slickers, were perhaps the muddiest of all the soil-soaked Portlanders that participated in Canyon Day this past Saturday, October 9.

“We come and hike around,” Georgia said. “I really like to come for the birds and salmon,” Lea said. This was the girls’ third time participating in the semesterly celebration of Reed’s canyon, and they certainly looked like they knew what they were doing.

The celebration marked the culmination of the three-month long culvert construction project on the north end of the canyon that will allow juvenile fish access to Reed Lake. The previous culvert was circular and only 16 inches across.

The new passage is 8-foot wide and will reduce the speed of water flow. Canyon Day is dedicated to the removal of invasive vegetation and the replanting of ecologically-friendly species. Reed has owned the property since 2007, but installation of the waterway began in July.

The 8-foot culvert was completed concurrently with a half-street improvement on SE 28 Street, an improvement required by city planning code, said Towny Angell, Director of Facilities Operations. In total the project cost approximately $700,000, and was primarily funded by the city, state, and metro grants. Reed will pay about 10 percent.

“This was an unprecedented cooperative effort between many agencies and individuals and was undertaken in understanding of the importance of clean water, improved fish habitat, and restored natural canopy,” Angell said.

This project was part of the City of Portland’s Grey to Green project, which aimed to restore and protect natural areas to improve watershed health. The Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, Portland Metro Council, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and the Bureau of Environmental Services were all involved with the project, said City Commissioner Dan Saltzman.

Dozens of Reed folks and community members showed up this weekend to tackle the nonnative English Ivy and Himalayan Blackberry and reintroduce some local vegetation to our lonely loam.

“We think the college is a wonderful neighbor to have,” said Louise Rasmussen, a resident of Reed’s neighborhood who comes out for Canyon Day twice a year with her husband, Lee. “They do so much for the community so we just thought we’d give back.”

Sucking in an air saturated with rain, music and the smell of home-made barbecue, the loyal volunteers zealously stuck their digits in the dirt, overturned the black plastic pots and scrunched the roots to allow easy transition into the soil.

“It feels good,” said Jamie Loos ‘11 as he wedged his shovel into the mud. “I walk through the canyon every day on my way to campus, and it’s made living here more enjoyable.”

President Colin Diver thanked Reedies and community members for taking part in restoration of the “true treasure” that is the Reed College Canyon at the dedication ceremony. City Commissioner Dan Saltzman also gaves thanks to the crowd.

Dramatic improvements in ecology like the canyon restoration can only be accomplished with community involvement, he said. The two planted a tree following the ceremony.

“It was an amazing turnout considering the weater,” said Zac Perry, grounds specialist. “I think any Canyon Day where people live with smiles on their faces is a good one.”
