A Bon Appétit hamburger: a patty of shoulder meat from a humanely treated, 100 percent true-blooded American, grass-fed organic cow that never had a drop of growth hormones in its life, a slice or two of tomato, pickles and onions to taste, ketchup and mustard. The price of a Bon Appétit hamburger: $2.68. Or $2.95. Maybe even $5.90.

The various payment methods available to those eating at Commons can have interesting effects on the de facto cost. Commuter cash is cheapest while using board points reveals inflated prices.
  
While any student or faculty member who lives off campus can get board points at a rate of 1.1 points per dollar, all students who live in dorms are required to purchase board plans with exchange rates as low as half a point per dollar. For a Board Plan C student, this doubles the cost of each food item. This means a student with Board Plan C pays $11 for the board points required to purchase a kombucha that costs $5.50.

The reality is that only a portion of the money paid for board plans goes to Bon Appétit. The remaining balance goes to the school, which in turn pays for the equipment, furnishings, insurance, utilities, and custodial services that are required to keep Commons running.
  
As a result when that kombucha is bought with Board Plan C points, the student is effectively paying $5.50 for the kombucha and another $5.50 for the clean cafeteria in which he or she can drink it.

Commons also uses offset pricing. This means certain items, such as the drinks, are priced up in order to keep other prices down. This explains some of the gap between Commons prices (Naked Juice: $4.35) and Safeway prices (Naked Juice: $3.29.) The rest of the gap is due to order quantity: retailers often get a better bargain if the shipment is larger. Since Commons’ order is notably smaller than Safeway’s, specialty drinks are priced at a premium.

There’s also the matter of the roughly $30,000 that the school pays to replace lost dishes each year. Whether the dishes are carelessly thrown away, converted into dorm room ashtrays or currently decorating houses from Flavel to Burnside, they need to be replaced. That money comes directly out of student board plans.

This means that the disparity between the price of food and the price of board points is not a source of profit for the school. Reed’s goal each year on for room and board is to break even, and the final numbers are usually pretty close.

However, there are ways for students to maximize their personal savings. Board Plan A gives students 1,625 points for $2,800 while Board Plan C costs $2,300 and supplies the student with 1,160 points. Students can first purchase Board Plan C then go to the Cashiers office in Eliot and purchase $500 worth of board points at the rate of 1.1 points per dollar. This nets 85 more board points per semester than Plan A.

Apartment residents are allowed to opt out of having board plans, and are therefore free to purchase as many commuter cash board points as they wish. With this freedom, an apartment resident can purchase the 1,160 points in Plan C for $1,054, saving $1,246 per semester. The only catch is that commuter cash must be paid for up front while board plans can be paid for at the same rate as tuition.

Though the system of board points versus cash money and expenses versus profit is complicated, Commons operates with much humanity. Not only do they have an atypical open kitchen policy, but they also mix a willingness to lend cooking equipment with a willingness to borrow ideas from students.

“We’re in business to make money, but we’re not here to steal money,” said operations manager Daxton King. “We appreciate student input. We don’t want to be evil food Nazis.”
