_Jyl Shaffer is the Assistant Dean for Sexual Assault Prevention & Response._

Since starting work at Reed just before the end of the fall semester, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to learn what every brand new Reedie learns: how to get around campus, how to balance all the daily requirements with having a life, and what it really means to be honorable. I’m so glad y’all are back so I can start learning from you too!

One of the greatest concerns I’ve heard voiced so far is a perceived lack of confidential resources for survivors—so here’s the low-down.  Although I want students to know they can come forward and safely seek support and help from me, Community Safety, the Judicial Board, and/or the criminal justice system, it’s important for survivors to know that these are not confidential resources, AND that you do have a confidential option on campus, 24 hours a day. During the week, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., you can go to the Health and Counseling Center, even without an appointment, to talk, ask questions about options, and create a safety plan. After hours and on the weekends you can still talk to one of the HCC counselors, confidentially, through the on-call system.

To access an on-call counselor, call Community Safety (503/771-1112) and ask for the on-call counselor. The dispatcher will ask if you’re a Reed student, and for optional call-back information in case the call gets dropped, but won’t ask you any other specific questions. The dispatcher will connect you with the HCC’s after-hours counseling service, ProtoCall. A confidential professional will ask the nature of your call.  If you say that you are calling about a sexual assault, ProtoCall staff will immediately put you in touch with the Reed Counselor On Call.

My professional background is in victim advocacy, and my top priority is working on creating the framework for comprehensive victim services. We cannot challenge all the isms that go along with sexual violence if we do not feel safe and supported in our home, and Reed is our home.

This spring I hope to get to know as many of you as possible. You may have seen me at midnight Red Light Green Light, or you may have non-verbally asked me for candy in the library. You’ll see me every week offering some activity to help all of us practice effective consent. You’ll see me working with groups like Healthy Masculinity at Reed, the MRC, and any other group of community members who want to talk about what we are doing to show the nation, starting with each other, that Consent is Reed.

Whether you’re a survivor, an ally, or you just want to know more about resources, visit our website, [www.reed.edu/sexual_assault][1]. If you have suggestions about other information that should be on the website, click on the link on the front page and send us your feedback. If you have questions for me, stop by my office in 28 West, e-mail me or stop me on campus. I’m happy to listen! Creating the Reed we all envision as a safe space will take time, but it’s important to know that we have support in place right now, ready to help.
