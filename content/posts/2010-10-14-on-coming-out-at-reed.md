**Kyle Webster**

I’m a bisexual man. This statement, while neither earth-shattering nor unbelievable, has not always been the easiest thing to say. Sure, at this point in my life I am fairly open with my family, friends and the general Reed community about my sexuality and I rarely hesitate to disclose it. But, it took me nineteen years to say it for the first time and twenty-two years before I was able to openly declare it to everyone and anyone. Even still, today, at the age of twenty-seven, I find myself sometimes having to come out to people whose reactions I’m unsure of and I do hesitate. I view being bisexual as a gift, but it’s not always an easy one to unpackage.

This week marks the twenty-second year we have had a National Coming Out Day. In these twenty-two years, we have seen immense advancements in the world and our country around LGBTQ issues and this nation is a better place for it.

Regardless of this progress, things continue to be less than perfect and especially in the past hand full of weeks, we have seen people ridiculed, teased and, in extreme cases, pushed to suicide as a result of intolerance. At least two national stories have dominated the airwaves as of late surrounding college students at schools perceived by most as liberal who have experienced this sort of extreme bigotry. This is not okay and, as a higher education administrator, member of the LGBTQ community, and human being, this breaks my heart and tears up my soul.

I think there’s a common misconception that it’s easy coming out at a place like Reed. But Reed does not exist in a vacuum that isolates us from the surrounding world. In this country, gay people are looked down on and treated as less than equal. On this campus, I have heard the words “that’s so gay” used casually in conversation by heterosexuals and I’ve seen the word “fag” venomously written across the tiles of the GCC restrooms.

Thus, I feel compelled to speak to the LGBTQ community of Reed: if you’ve ever felt unsafe here, I’m sorry. If you’ve ever questioned whether or not you’re supported here, I’m sorry. If you’ve ever felt alone and longed for a community you couldn’t initially find, I’m sorry. If the administration and student body of this community have ever hesitated in its support of you, I’m sorry.

Reed is a great place and we are above the curve when it comes to sexuality, but that just means that the national curve is too low. Being a part of the LGBTQ community is a gift. We have the ability to love and see the world in a way most never will. I’m proud of that and I’m proud of us. So, happy Coming Out Day.

Know you’re supported and loved. If you ever doubt this, feel free to stop by my office and we’ll talk. Honestly, I’ve been there.
