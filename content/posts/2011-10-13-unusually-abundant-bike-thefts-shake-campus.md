When asked if this year&#8217;s bike thefts exceeded the normal  amount, Gary Granger&#8217;s response was simple: “Um, yeah!” There have been 40% more bike thefts this year than there were at this time last year (14 vs 10). Thieves have not just been taken unlocked bikes or cable-locked bikes; they are actually cutting U-locks.

Thefts of bikes that are simply locked with cable locks are common in Portland, but thefts of bikes with U-locks are rarer, and U-locks are generally thought of as the strongest defense against bike theft. While U-locks are safer, there are certain methods that can pick certain types of U-locks, but Reed is encountering a different problem. Community Safety has been finding _cut_ U-locks all over campus.

Granger noted that the U-locks cannot be cut with standard bolt cutters that aren’t at least 4’ long, and that the U-locks all over campus look like they&#8217;ve been cut by “Jaws”–a device either powered by electricity or hydraulics that can go straight through thick pieces of metal, including U-locks. This device would be noticeable but not necessarily large, and could be hidden in a bag, backpack, or large coat, said Granger.

It is possible, according to Granger, that some of these thefts were driven by the large community presence at the Centennial Celebration. “People who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise see campus see things that they can steal,” said Granger. “It&#8217;s the downside to having an open campus.”

Granger also noted that Community Safety would be taking measures to curb the thefts at the bookstore, including informing bookstore employees as to how to stop theft. Furthermore, he believes that the cameras would be a helpful deterrent, but noted that retail theft is an unfortunate fact of life. He also spoke about the fact that one of the bookstore thieves caught last week knew the format of our student ID numbers, saying that it was likely that the thief knew a student, though it was also possible that he had simply found an ID card.
  
Community Safety is taking certain steps to respond to the bike thefts. They&#8217;ve been communicating with the Portland Police, and CSOs have changed their patrol priorities to check bike racks more frequently, but Gary noted this is about all they can do. There are many bike racks on campus, and only a few CSOs at a time, and a theft takes about two minutes. Granger also disdained the idea in last week&#8217;s Quest poll, which asked whether bike racks should have security cameras. Granger noted that besides potential community rights issues they would be expensive and ineffective, and would work mainly as a minor deterrence.

Granger offered a far less expensive and more practical solution. “It&#8217;s about the community paying attention. If they see somebody sketchy or who looks like they don&#8217;t belong, they should call.” When people call Community Safety to examine the threat from a suspicious person, Community Safety approaches them and asks a few simple questions–whether or not they&#8217;re a Reed student, and what they&#8217;re doing on campus. “If they&#8217;re a Reed student, they&#8217;re usually happy to see us,” noted Granger. “It&#8217;s not difficult to spot somebody who shouldn&#8217;t be here.”

Granger related an anecdote to illustrate how this might work: “During O-week, I saw two white, twenty-something males on campus. I thought there was something weird about them, and followed them. Sure enough, when they noticed me following them they ran to their car and drove away. I realized later that it was because they both were wearing the same clothes. I&#8217;ve never seen two Reedies wearing the same thing.”
