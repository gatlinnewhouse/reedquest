A gender studies major may still be a distant possibility at Reed, but a group of faculty are working to ensure that the discipline still has a place at the college. Reed’s Gender Faculty Consortium, a group of professors interested in gender-related issues, has been busy building an intercollegiate association on gender studies and organizing an annual Sex, Gender, and Sexuality Symposium for next fall.

Professors are making progress in the classroom, as well. Anthropology Professor Charlene Makley notes a significant increase in permanent faculty members teaching courses with themes of sex, gender, and sexuality—a growing trend that was the impetus for forming the Gender Faculty Consortium in the first place. While no formal gender studies major (which would require difficult-to-acquire, full-faculty approval) exists at present, History Professor Jacqueline Dirks &#8217;82 says, “students shouldn&#8217;t wait—look at the catalog, talk to professors, and sign up for classes!”

These developments accompany another gradual change in the atmosphere surrounding gender studies at Reed. Dirks says, “While many female professors were employed at Reed over the years, most were hired to temporary rather than tenure-track positions. Reed only began to hire and tenure female academics in significant numbers beginning in the early 1990s.” Dirks reports that in the mid-nineties she was appointed, with English Professor Nathalia King and French Professor Bill Ray, by the Committee on Academic Policy and Planning to an “ad hoc committee to look into the status of gender studies at Reed.” According to Dirks, the committee’s report found that “while a number of classes were being offered, mainly in Lit and Lang, most were being taught by visiting professors,” rather than permanent faculty, and the report “concluded that a major wasn&#8217;t necessary.”

Outside of the classroom, students can look forward to Reed’s first Sex, Gender and Sexuality Symposium, which Political Science Professor Tamara Metz has led the way in organizing, next fall. Metz has recruited Anne Fausto-Sterling, known for her work on intersexuality, to speak at the symposium. Fausto-Sterling will give a public lecture and an exclusive seminar limited to 20 people, including a number of students, who will have to apply to participate.

With increasing activity on the part of the Gender Faculty Consortium, students can expect the rise in interdivisional effort and support to improve overall gender studies course quality. According to Makley, roughly 20 faculty across departments currently gather twice a semester to discuss “how to think about their syllabi, share resources, and talk of where the [sex, gender and sexuality] research is.” Any faculty member is welcome to join the Consortium, though the group is composed mostly of professors teaching courses dealing with gender studies, like Art Professor Kris Cohen’s _Performing Mediation_ and English Professor Gail Sherman’s _Ethnicities and Genders in Graphic Narrative_.

Beyond Reed, Sociology professor Kjersten Whittington, with help from Makley and representatives from Lewis & Clark College and Willamette University, has received funding to form a Gender Studies Faculty Consortium with the NorthWest 5 Consortium—which also includes Puget Sound University and Whitman College—from its Fund for Collaborative Inquiry. According to the NW5C website, the project aims to “facilitate communication across our campuses, the sharing of campus-based news and events, and provide support for pedagogical practices and research in these topical areas.”
