In a surprise announcement on Friday morning, Assistant Dean of Residence Life Serilda Summers submitted her immediate resignation just as returning students began moving into their dorms for the fall 2010 semester.

Associate Dean for Student and Campus Life Pete Meagher sent a statement to the Housing Advisers and other effected staff announcing the change, saying, &#8220;We thank her for her hard work with the Residence Life program and wish her the best in her future endeavors.&#8221;

Jonathan Gonzales, second year Residence Director for Anna Mann and Old Dorm Block, expressed his reaction via email on Sunday. &#8220;Serilda&#8217;s departure came as a surprise to us, but I support her decision as she felt she did what was best for her at this time.&#8221; Still, he said, &#8220;I will miss the leadership and energy that she brought to our department.&#8221;

Both Meagher and Gonzales have faith in the solid foundation Summers leaves behind. Said Meagher, &#8220;There is a strong and capable Residence Life staff in place that includes our Assistant Director of Housing, Amy Shuckman, as well as five master&#8217;s trained Resident Directors and an administrative assistant.&#8221; While the timing of her departure is unfortunate, neither staff member appeared deeply concerned about it&#8217;s long-term impact on the effectiveness of Residence Life.

Summers joined the Reed community in August 2006 as a Residence Director for the cross canyon dorms, eventually being promoted to Assistant Director of Residence Life. She served as the Assistant Dean for the past year.

The search for a replacement will begin this fall with the hope of filling the position by the spring semester.

In the meantime Meagher will serve as the interim Director supervising RDs, answering day-to-day questions, and overseeing the smooth operation of the college&#8217;s seventeen dorms.
