At the start of each new semester, whispers and rumors of the so-called “Reed Plague” begin to fly around. These rumors are then verified when our peers are absent from classes, or worse, sit sniffling and sneezing in lecture halls. It is all too easy to fight through sickness and continue on with our academic lives, but this year especially it is important to be conscious of your own health and that of others. 

The 2017–2018 flu season is underway, and, according to a media statement from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, it is going to be a rough year. Dr. Fitzgerald explains that the virus circulating this season is influenza A, the most common form of it being H3N2. This type of virus is associated with a more severe illness, resulting in more hospitalizations and deaths.

To prevent contracting the flu this season, the CDC recommends taking basic precautions such as washing your hands and avoiding contact with sick persons. During an interview with Dr. Jennifer Edman, director of the Reed Health and Counseling Center (HCC), she emphasized the importance of community awareness in washing hands and not sharing food or drink, including in Commons. According to Dr. Edman, people can be contagious before showing symptoms, meaning that seemingly innocent pizza crust you left at the scrounge when you felt totally fine could cause someone to become sick later. 

Another preventative suggestion offered by Dr. Dan Jernigan, director of the influenza division in CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, is to receive your flu vaccine. The vaccine covers multiple strains, some of which are also prolific this season. According to the HCC, over 800 Reed students, faculty members, and staff attended the annual campus vaccination event. Although the HCC no longer has a supply of vaccines, local pharmacies provide flu shots which often come at no cost with medical insurance.

Although the flu vaccine is strongly recommended by CDC officials, it is important to note that the vaccine is far from perfect. CDC data indicates that it takes at least two weeks for the protection from the vaccine to set in. The vaccine also varies drastically in effectiveness, ranging from 10–60% over the last 13 years. In the past seasons when the same strain (H3N2) was most prevalent, 2012–2013 and 2014–2015, vaccine effectiveness was 49% and 19% respectively. In spite of this fluctuating success rate, it is important to get vaccinated because it can help to protect other community members who are unable to get their flu shot, as well as to reduce the severity of the flu should you still contract it. 

If you do happen to contract the flu, the main thing you can do is stay home from class while you are sick. The CDC says that healthy adults are most contagious for three to four days after symptoms begin, but can continue to infect others for up to seven days. A recent study from the University of Maryland concluded that sneezing and coughing is not required for disease transmission. Simply breathing in close proximity to another sick individual is sufficient for influenza virus aerosolization and infection. If you do become sick, it is important to wear a mask, even for excursions as small as leaving your room to use the restroom. Masks can be found at the HCC along with cold care kits, and cold medicine may be purchased in the Reed bookstore.

You can talk to a physician at the HCC about taking preventive medication if your roommate or someone you live in close proximity to becomes ill. The HCC can also provide documentation for professors in order to excuse flu-related absences. This measure must be done proactively and is only applicable if the HCC recommends self-isolation. Isolation is typically recommended if you have a fever and have a positive rapid influenza test, which can be performed at the HCC and involves swabbing the nasal cavity. While not dangerous, the procedure can be mildly uncomfortable, and the test determines if you have influenza within ten minutes. 

 In order to care for yourself if you do contract the flu, the Mayo Clinic recommends getting bed rest and drinking plenty of fluids. You can also take some over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen, to help with aches. It is also important to avoid alcohol, as it tends to make you dehydrated, thus aggravating the illness. Alcohol should especially not be mixed with over-the-counter pain relievers.

Dr. Edman of the HCC recommends discussing prescription antiviral medications for those with compromising medical conditions. This should be done promptly after symptoms develop, because time is a key factor in their effectiveness. Dr. Edman also notes that secondary infections, when your symptoms return after apparent improvement, can be a problem especially in young adults (that’s you, Reedies!). Secondary infections tend to be caused by bacterial infections which need to be treated with antibiotics, and therefore it is especially important to get treated by a doctor.

Since October, the CDC has reported 37 pediatric deaths due to the flu, and schools in 11 states have closed due to flu outbreaks.It is highly unlikely that Reed will escape the impact of the flu, as CDC director of the influenza division, Dr. Jernigan explained, saying simply, the “flu is everywhere in the U.S. right now.” Thankfully, the HCC reports low rates of influenza so far at Reed, with no cases yet this year. However, our luck may not last, so it is important that all members of the community take the proper measures to ensure that everyone remains healthy this flu season.
