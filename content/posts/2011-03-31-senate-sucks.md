_Bylaw Revision Controversy Strains Relationship between Senate, Treasury_

Sunday marked the end of a weeklong strike by Head Treasurer Torra Spillane and Assistant Treasurer Khagemba Adhikarimayum described by Senator Robert “Schwartz” Kahn during Monday’s Senate meeting as, “almost semi-serious.”

The treasury went on strike to protest the fact that they were non-voting members of Finance Committee. In response to the strike, a bylaw change penned by Kahn was proposed during Monday’s Senate meeting.

The bylaw in question, Article II Section 2, E ii, currently reads: “The Finance Committee shall consist of the Vice President of the Student Body, three other Senators, the Student Body Treasurer, the Student Body Vice Treasurer and the Student Body Assistant Treasurer. The Vice President shall be the chairperson. The presence of three voting members shall constitute quorum. The Treasurers shall be non-voting members.”

The proposed change alter the last sentence to read as follows: “The Student Body Vice Treasurer and the Student Body Assistant Treasurer shall be non-voting members.”

This change would grant the Head Treasurer a vote in Finance Committee.

Concerns were raised by Kahn regarding the fact that treasurers are appointed and not elected and met by former Treasurer Cori Savaiano’s claims that treasurers are equally qualified to vote on budget issues as most senators.

Vice President Will Gester motioned to delete the last sentence of the bylaw and modify quorum to five members, granting all three treasurers a vote, but was voted down. Senator Todd Garon’s motion to table the issue until next week’s meeting was passed, granting Senate time to consider the issue further.

Should the bylaw be changed, Senate would still be able to overturn Finance Committee suggestions with a majority vote.

After the meeting, President Nora McConnell-Johnson said, “I want the treasurers to have a vote. I think we will have a resolution next week.”

Spillane only said, “Senate sucks.”
