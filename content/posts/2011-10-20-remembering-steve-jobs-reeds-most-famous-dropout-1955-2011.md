Steve Jobs passed away on October 5th from pancreatic cancer. Jobs revolutionized technology across the board, founding both Apple and Pixar. Jobs is notable at Reed for being our most famous non-graduate. He enrolled at Reed for one semester and then dropped out, hanging around to unofficially audit classes for a year and a half. Because of his short time at Reed and his subsequent fame, Jobs&#8217; relationship to Reed is shrouded in myth.

Jobs lived in Westport for his first semester at Reed, and spent the remaining time couch-surfing. Jobs, like all of us, took Hum, and, like many of us, he hated it at the time and loved it in retrospect. Jobs said in his 1991 speech at Reed&#8217;s commencement that, “It seemed like a meaningless and cruel endeavor at the time. (But) it has helped me in everything I&#8217;ve ever done.” He also took a Shakespeare class, a dance class, and most importantly, a calligraphy class with Robert Palladino, a then-visiting professor of art.

It was from this calligraphy class that Jobs came up with the idea of fonts. Before that, fonts were something from calligraphy, and computer typography was restrained to basic block letters. In Jobs&#8217; words, “I learned about serif and sans serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.” Jobs noted that this knowledge seemed useless at the time, but that ten years later it would lead to the Macintosh’s becoming the first computer with “beautiful typography.” Windows copied this from the Macintosh, and the rest is history.

Even though he had to drop out, Jobs must have been grateful for his education.  In 1983, Reed became one of twenty-five colleges (and perhaps the only liberal arts school) to receive the early Macintosh. There were only about twelve of them, and they all resided in a computer lab in Elliot Hall. The Macintosh changed the nature of academia, according to Rory Bowman &#8217;90, “The Macintosh made it much easier to rewrite.  It also made it easier to move around and play with structure than it had been before.  And professors told me it dramatically improved the quality of writing because people could revise more easily.”

Jobs did not often discuss his feelings about his time at Reed, and his own statements about the college were generally positive but ambiguous. Jobs&#8217; 1991 commencement address closed with the following striking lines, &#8220;Character is built not in good times but in bad times, not in a time of plenty but in a time of adversity&#8211;and this school seems to nurture that spirit of adversity.” There was some uneasy laughter, for it seemed that Jobs was simultaneously highlighting the counter cultural, “question everything” spirit of Reed that inspired him, and the fact that, like many Reedies from the seventies, the school hadn&#8217;t made it easy for him. Jobs continued, “Thank you for teaching me how to be hungry and how to keep that with me my whole life.&#8221;

“Hungry” also had a double meaning. Jobs was referring, in part, to the innovative spirit that drove him to found Apple. But he was also referring to the fact that, due to Reed&#8217;s high tuition and mediocre financial aid that depleted all of Job&#8217;s parents’ savings, he had to collect coke bottles to pay for food, not eat for days at a time, and hitchhike across town to a Hare Krishna temple for one square meal a week.

Still, Jobs had nothing but positive things to say about the generosity of Reedies, particularly then-Dean of Students Jack Dudman. Dudman looked the other way as Jobs was staying on campus for free. Jobs praised Dudman&#8217;s generosity, “When I was at the end of my rope, Jack would go for a walk with me and I would discover a $20 bill in my tattered coat pocket with no mention of it from Jack before, during, or after.”

So what can we learn from Jobs&#8217; time at Reed? In the words of Colin Diver, “Jobs has said he left Reed for two reasons: lack of money and lack of interest in much of Reed&#8217;s curriculum. If a Steve Jobs came to Reed today, he would get much more financial aid and support outside the classroom, but he&#8217;d still have to take Hum 110 and write a thesis.” Jobs certainly seems to have seen the value of the curriculum in retrospect, and as Reed moves further towards need-blind admissions and begins to provide better support for students struggling outside the classroom, we can be reminded of how far we&#8217;ve come – and how far we still have to go.
