This year Residence Life is rolling out a brand new model to foster helpful communication between freshmen and their HAs.

One specific aspect of the new programming model involves having HAs meet individually with new students on their floors.

“With first-year students we ask that the HAs meet with each of them once per quarter, and we have provided a structure for them to use,” Resident Director Nayland Olsen says.

Resident Director Jessica Gibsonone of the key architects of the new programming model adds, “The structure is derived from our department’s mission and values.”

The new model is a collaborative effort between both the faculty and the students.

It is no great revelation that the transition from high school to college can be challenging. For those unaccustomed to living away from home, the uncharted waters of dorm life can be difficult to navigate. Sophomore Maia Scarpetta, thinking back upon her freshman year, says, “I knew people who could have benefited from some extra help.” And at Reed, the myriad stresses of schoolwork can compound quickly.

However, while the model strives to reach out to students in a structured, deliberate manner, it also risks alienating and frustrating some with its formality. Scarpetta adds, “Having an upperclassman pay attention to you and helping you figure your life out is nice, but when it’s required it may take away from the sincerity of the act.”

Yet in theory the check-ins are not intended to be a burden to HAs or students. Olsen expanded upon the flexible nature of the check-ins: “We intend for residents to get out of the conversation whatever they want to. If the conversation becomes all about their major, great; if the conversation becomes all about where they grew up, great; if the conversation forays into an opportunity for an HA to provide support or a referral, great. We just want new students to feel like they have an experienced student with whom they can talk about whatever.”

Inspired by the work of individual HAs in the past and their attempts at reaching out to students, these new check-ins attempt to formalize what once was an informal process. Perhaps some of the sincerity might be lost in the transition. Yet regardless of whether the increased structure of the new program proves to help or hurt the effectiveness of these meetings, the true success of the new model will ultimately depend upon individual students and their varying levels of receptivity.
