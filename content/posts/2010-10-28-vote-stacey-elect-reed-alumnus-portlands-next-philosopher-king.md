**Joel Batterman ‘10**

[crackle] Hope you can hear me through this bubble, folks. I’m at the edge of metro Detroit, hollering back some advice on the Oregon ballot you may have in your mailbox. 

The “Metro Council President” part, specifically, which stars Bob Stacey and Tom Hughes.
  
Obscure as it is, this race is crucial for our common future, and I hope you vote for Bob.

“Metro Council,” perhaps the most unique American governing body you’ve never heard of, is the only elected regional government in the USA. Tasked with land-use planning and transportation policy for the tri-county Portland region, it’s headquartered in the former Sears store on Grand Ave. But ultimately your choice for Metro Council President is much more important than any household appliance decision. Let me explain.

In other areas of the country the idea that citizens should actually vote for the officials who decide how to use millions of our dollars for transportation is laughably naive. Not so in the Portland region, which has embarked on a great Noble Experiment of American history. Unlike Prohibition, this experiment deals in democratic governance, sustainable urban development, and green transportation systems, and it actually seems to be working.

Consider: The miles that an average person in the Portland region drives a car per day was actually lower in 2005 than 1995. Contrast that to the rest of the country: Americans drove, on average, one thousand miles more per person per year. Moreover, going green hasn’t hurt Portlanders’ lives. The transit and bicycle facilities here make it fairly easy to get around in a healthy, fun and inexpensive manner. More sustainable communities leave you more money for local brews (due to reduced gas costs) and less obese to boot.

Credit for Portland’s greening goes to a lot of people, institutions, and historical forces.
  
But Metro Council has been a big part of that transformation. It’s Metro that’s held the region’s urban growth boundary (an anti-sprawl device unique to Oregon) mostly in place, directing new development inwards rather than out into the countryside. And it’s Metro that’s sent regional transport money towards new rail lines, bus lines and bike facilities, instead of blowing it all on highways that get congested as soon as they’re built.

So who’s Bob Stacey, and why should he head Metro? Bob is a Reedie (’72) who’s spent most of his life fighting for the policies that have made Portland great. Most of that time, Bob’s been with 1000 Friends of Oregon, the nonprofit environmental outfit which works to protect farms and forests from sprawl while fostering livable cities. It’s hard to imagine anyone more knowledgeable than Bob when it comes to those tasks, which also happen to be Metro’s job description. He’s a guy who could spend hours plotting vehicle-miles-traveled scenarios on a whiteboard. (As an intern for 1000 Friends, I had the pleasure of transcribing those scribblings. But I am no longer in Bob’s employ, and I’m writing this of my own volition.)

In short, Bob is just the kind of dork Metro needs, and such a responsible one that he took it upon himself to serve as a Queditor when the paper had stopped publishing and everyone else was probably sitting naked in trees. He’s living proof that the environmental idealism of the time can be translated into policy with the power to save the world, and of the intellectual fortitude, fitted to a strong sense of honor, which this College can foster at its best. As you might expect, Bob wants to create jobs, keep a lid on sprawl and build more transit lines. His opponent, the former mayor of Hillsboro, thinks we need to expand the urban growth boundary to permit more sprawling development. The choice is clear: Portland can grow best by strengthening the policies that have made Portland great, the policies which Bob’s been pushing since around the time he bought his first washing machine at the Metro building, then Sears, several decades ago.

Vote for Bob. As green as Portland may seem, it has a long way to go, and the rest of America needs the region to keep pushing the bar higher for sustainable, just, and prosperous human civilization. My time in Portland, with Bob’s group, convinced me that while my home state was still ensnared in rampant sprawl, real change was possible, and I could be part of that change. Perhaps after casting your ballot, some of you will consider how you too can become a transportation geek, er, help bring our cities a sustainable, just and prosperous future. As the cover of Ernest Callenbach’s Ecotopia used to read, “Imagine a future that works!” Then go out and build it, young Reedie.
