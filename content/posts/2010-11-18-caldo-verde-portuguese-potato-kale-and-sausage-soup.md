This is a great meal to make when it’s cold, dreary, and downright depressing outside &#8211; i.e., perfect for Portland fall/winter (I vote we condense them into one season). You don’t see much of it on this side of the country, but it’s very popular on the East coast &#8211; Boston and other coastal Massachussetts towns are due west of Portugal and the Azores and therefore have large Portugese populations.

Caldo verde is cheap, delicious, and best of all, completely customizable. Use russet or red potatoes if you don’t want to spend extra on Yukon Golds; if you can’t find linguiça, replace it with chorizo, andouille, kielbasa, or any cured sausage that will hold its shape when sliced or diced; if you’re not into kale, use any robust leafy green you like: collards, Swiss chard, mustard greens, etc. Finally, you can even use soyrizo and vegetable broth to make this vegan (sans butter, of course).

**Tips:**

The prep work can take upwards of 45 minutes if you’re not fast with a knife. To save time, peel and slice the potatoes up to a day ahead of time, then refrigerate them in a large airtight container, completely covered with cold water. The kale can also be ribboned up to a day ahead, then refrigerated in a plastic bag (put a dry paper towel in there too, to soak up any rogue moisture).

To “ribbon” the kale, remove the tough stem and separate the kale into single leaves as best you can.

Then roll leaves up lengthwise (like a cigar) and slice very thinly (about 1/8” thick) crosswise to make long ribbons.

Homemade chicken stock definitely makes a better soup, but honestly, boxed or caned stuff is perfectly acceptable &#8211; just always, always use reduced-sodium broth.

Caldo verde is potato and kale soup with sausage, not the other way around. The sausage should be treated like a garnish. Aim for 3 or 4 slices, or 1-2 Tb diced, per bowl; any more is totally overwhelming.

**Ingredients: (serves 4)**

  * 4-5 big Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and very thinly sliced into rounds (~1/8” thick)
  * 1 large onion, minced
  * 4-5 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 Tb butter
  * 2 Tb olive oil
  * 1 box (32 oz, 4 cups) chicken or veggie stock
  * 1 large bunch kale, stems removed and leaves ribboned
  * 1/2 lb. linguiça sausage or your preference (equivalent to two 6”-long links), sliced 1/4” thick or cut into 1/4” dice
  * Salt and pepper to taste

&#8212;-
  
Heat the olive oil and butter in a large, lidded pot (a stock pot works well, or an enameled Dutch Oven if you’ve got one) over medium-low heat. When the butter has melted and foamed slightly, add the onions and garlic. Cook, covered, for about 5 minutes or until the onions have softened. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for an additional 3-5 minutes or until the onions are translucent and very soft.

If you’ve prepared the potatoes ahead of time, drain them well. Add the slices of potatoes to the pot, cover with chicken broth, and bring to a rolling boil. Then reduce heat so the broth doesn’t boil over during cooking; cover the pot and cook, mashing every 5 minutes with a wooden spoon, until you have a big pot of potato mush. This will probably take about 25 minutes. (Be careful here &#8211; hot potato mush really likes to jump out of the pot and adhere itself to your delicate skin.)

When you have a big pot of boiling mush, remove it from heat, stir in the kale ribbons, and cover.

While waiting for the kale to cook (which will take 5 minutes at most), heat a tablespoon or so of olive oil in a frying pan until it smokes, then reduce heat slightly. Fry your sausage slices or cubes in batches so that there’s at least 1/2” between pieces in the pan; reserve cooked sausage on a paper-towel-ed plate. When all of the sausage bits are nicely browned, stir them into the soup.

CAREFULLY (the burns from boiling caldo verde really hurt) taste the soup, and add salt and/or pepper as needed. If you find the soup too thick for your liking, thin it out with additional stock.

Spoon into bowls, drizzle with olive oil and serve with a big slice of bread —because using carbs to soak up other carbs is ABSOLUTELY a reasonable thing to do — and enjoy!
