The search has begun to rename the “Class of 2010 Scholarship,” an on-campus fundraiser to establish a scholarship for an incoming freshman. Meetings have only just begun for the new campaign but organizers are considering the catchy tag “Reedies for Reedies,” a play on the student committee name “Reedies for Reed.”

This year’s organizing committee is planning a few changes for the fundraising as it attempts to repeat last year’s successes. Most importantly, the committee is focused on reminding the community about the importance of giving. The seven students directing the project represent every grade, in contrast to the previous group of four seniors.

“Last year [the organizers] started off only targeting the seniors but they didn’t raise enough money so they opened it up to the entire school,” said Erica Boulay, a senior committee member.

Instead, this year’s effort will include the entire student body in the fundraising effort from the outset.

President Colin Diver matched the campaign’s $6,707 catch last year, The students on the committee find it important for a previous student to match the funds raised by the current student body rather than the school’s president. “This year we are going to have an alumnus or several alumni match the amount instead of Colin Diver,” Boulay explained.

“Student giving is not only extremely important to the future of financial aid at Reed, but it also sends a very powerful message to both the college and other students. It means that you value the education you received here so much that you want future Reedies to benefit similarly,” responds Boulay about the importance of giving back. The committee hopes that reminding current students will result in a higher percentage of donations after graduation.

Some fun ideas to get students involved, said Boulay, include, “a t-shirt competition, or a competition between dorms, free food in the library for students, and a fun entertainment program with alumni speaking about their exciting lives and talking about the importance of giving to the Annual Fund.”

No quantitative goal has been discussed for the campaign but the money will be placed in a separate account for use by financial aid. “The amount students give is not important, so much that students give at all. I feel inspired when students and alumni give back to Reed,” summarizes Boulay in describing the campaign.
