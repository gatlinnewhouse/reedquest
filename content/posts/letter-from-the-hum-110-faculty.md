Dear Reed Community Members,

We, members of the faculty teaching in Hum 110 this year, would like to clarify a few issues about the Humanities lectures and protests. On MWF from 9:00-9:50, Vollum Lecture Hall functions as a teaching space and, as such, it is our responsibility to ensure that that space remains under the purview of the day’s Hum 110 lecturer or lecturers. The Hum faculty has agreed to defer to and support decisions of individual lecturers to determine the conditions in the lecture hall so that they are conducive to their presentation. 

Hum 110 faculty members hold a broad array of opinions about current debates with regard to the course.  We are united both in respecting the importance of dissent and the ideals that animate it, and in our commitment to the college’s pedagogical mission.  While Reed’s dissent policy may be an imperfect document, it establishes clear boundaries for protest with the goal of protecting Reed’s pedagogical mission. On Monday, when three protesters interrupted the lecture presentation by taking the microphone, that boundary was crossed and, therefore, we cancelled the lecture. While this position was supported by a majority of those teaching in the course, it is important to note that this decision was not unanimous.

We assure you that the Humanities faculty is taking seriously concerns raised by Reedies Against Racism.  Last year we both held open community meetings and met with members of RAR in a series of moderated conversations (the 6X6 meetings).  The Humanities faculty have accelerated the decennial review of the course, and a committee worked this summer to develop an alternate syllabus that the full Hum 110 faculty -- approximately 40 Reed faculty members -- will consider along with two other alternatives this fall. We expect to continue to engage in conversation about the course and welcome that engagement. At the same time, we will also continue to uphold the college's pedagogical mission and to respect our colleagues’ right to their teaching space during Humanities 110 lectures.

Sincerely,

Members of the Hum 110 faculty
