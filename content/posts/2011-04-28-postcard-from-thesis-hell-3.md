A warning for all the kids out there: when your thesis adviser tells you everything is fine and you can just spend the rest of your time editing what you have two weeks before your thesis is due –HE IS LYING!  You know why he is lying?  Cause your first reader will decide that she wants to meet with you to discuss your data and model for 90 minutes less than 2 weeks before your thesis is due.  Once she has finally decided that you have not committed academic fraud by purposefully messing up your dataset or data mining, she will tell you that you still need to re-do the only part of your thesis that actually matters.  Here’s where the fun comes in- you leave her office, bolt to the bathroom so she doesn’t see you erupt into tears.  But you can’t cry for too long because you have to go give a presentation on land use in Fargo, ND for in the class you have with your thesis adviser, who, by the way, you hate at the moment for not doing better job of silencing (not in permanent way, don’t worry) your first reader. After discussing Fargo in all its glory, you can finally go home to grab your ice cream and Jose.  With supplies in hand, you can head back to the ETC to listen to the Backstreet Boys while you run every fucking possible variable through every fucking possible model in Stata.  You think it ends there?  Nope.  Cause the next morning in your political science class, you will think you have it under control, until your friend asks you how you are doing and you erupt into those damn tears again.  The one thing you can say to yourself to maintain your sanity is that there’s no way teaching math at an under resourced high school in a mob run state can be as stressful as this shit (especially if there are trees around!).
