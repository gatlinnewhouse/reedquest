Informed, unadulterated, hilarious, mentor, badass; these are all words students use to describe the former Assistant Dean of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Jyl Shaffer. Having left Reed for the University of Houston on Aug. 16 , Shaffer is now working to process Title IX sexual discrimination claims. Although she no longer walks around Reed’s campus, her impact can still be felt among the student body.

Aside from working tirelessly on the new Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct policy, she also altered the broader conversation on sexual assault.

“We talk about issues of sexual misconduct differently than before she got here,” Student Body President Ari Galper says.

Although not a Reed alum herself, she infused the conversation with the intellectual acumen and emotional tenacity of a Reedie. From the Friday senate meetings to the Student Activities Office, her discussions, whether public or private, illustrated her straight-forwardness and attention to detail. She was not afraid to speak her opinion and provide reasoning to back it up.

“Most people aren’t willing to challenge you in that way,” says junior Annam Swanson, who worked with Jyl during the course of her tenure.

Today her ADSAPR seat lies vacant and the administration is in the early stages of analyzing the very position Jyl once held. “The ambiguity of her responsibility of her role kept her from making all the changes she wanted,” says Ari, who believed that the level of administrative support at Reed didn’t exactly meet her expectations. According to those who worked for her, she was “a great, underutilized resource” by both the students and the administration.

Shaffer’s perspective was unique among faculty members. She was able to articulate the positions of people outside of Reed, and didn’t alter her opinions to fit the Reed mold.

“Jyl is Jyl, always,” sophomore Ali Ryan says, who worked with her last year. From student-administration duality, to interpretation of federal law, to the perils of social work, Shaffer examined the broad picture and used it to remind Reedies that while we may live in a bubble, we must consider the larger implications if the whole world thought like we do. But her unique perspective was not what most impacted the students I interviewed.

“She was trusted for her person, not her position,” Galper says. More than her knowledge, more than her administrative qualifications, more than her experience, was her love of the people she worked with.  “She was so much of a mentor,” Ryan says, noting that Shaffer had passed out a Bell Hooks feminist guidebook to her and the rest of her student workers at the beginning of their employment. Shaffer always made time for anyone who wished to see her, whether by appointment or not. Both Galper and Swanson recalled visiting her under simple pretenses, then spending hours in her office discussing all topics under the sun. One of Shaffer’s more memorable musings involved disembodied penises and vagina’s running around campus and latching on to students’ legs.

From her sex-toys workshop to her 25-page magazine, “Sex and Identity at Reed,” Shaffer’s projects aimed to amplify the conversation of sexuality at Reed. “The vast majority of our work was about communicating effectively,” Ryan says. More informally, this summer Shaffer would hold weekly barbeques open for anyone to drop in. She even bought a giant trophy at the bins and passed it to a different employee every week.

People seem to have trouble summarizing their feelings about Shaffer. “If I could sum up my sentiments, I’d say: Damn,” Ari says. Ryan puts her thoughts about Shaffer in a different way: “ I wish I could see her walk around campus again.” Two sentiments about a woman who, for a moment, both showed Reed what it was, and helped define what it could become.
