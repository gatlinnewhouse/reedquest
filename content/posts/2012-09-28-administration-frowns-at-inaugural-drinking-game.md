While the school seemed charged with energy in the days preceding President John Kroger’s inauguration, a number of students just couldn’t get that excited about the event. That is, until a certain game helped them see inauguration through a new lens: the lens of cheap and poor-tasting alcohol. An “Inauguration Drinking Game,” which instructed participants to drink if Kroger “talks about the ‘Life of the Mind,’” “quotes a philosopher,” or “says the word ‘Reedie,’” proliferated on Facebook amongst the student population, engaging them in a challenging new way to have fun at Kroger’s grand soiree.

It didn’t start as an actual challenge, though. “I didn’t realize that people would take this as a real game,” creator Ben ‘14, who asked that his last name not be used, said. “I was just sitting with friends, and we were talking about how boring inauguration would be. Then I thought of how much more interesting the whole spectacle would be if you were drinking at the same time. Plus, Kroger already has a stereotype built up around campus, he already has such a character, that there are plenty of tropes we can poke fun at. I didn’t make it to be real, I just wanted to satirize Krogs a bit, welcome him in.”

Apparently that message didn’t reach many students reading the Facebook event, who took the joke literally. On his experience with the Inauguration Drinking Game (subtitled “Gettin’ Gone with John”) one freshman who preferred to remain unnamed said, “It was fun, but I finished my drink halfway through his speech. When you have a president that says ‘Life of the Mind’ every other sentence, your drink will be gone fast. However, I spent the remainder of inauguration pleasantly inebriated.”

“Dude, you weren’t pleasantly inebriated, you were belligerently drunk!” a friend interjected. “That was later; during the speech I was pleasant,” the freshman retorted.

However, the drinking game wasn’t all fun and underage imbibement. Ben received a tenebrous and urgent e-mail the night before inauguration from Associate Dean of Student and Campus Life Bruce Smith urging Ben to take the event down and meet with him the next morning. Smith was concerned the event might damage Reed&#8217;s public reputation, though after Ben argued it was an exercise of free speech, he allowed the event to continue. Smith could not be reached for comment by press time.

With the event back up, many participants rejoined the fold, and the inauguration, and the game, went off without a hitch. It certainly led those that partook to have a certain elation about the entire goings-ons. The ‘pleasantly inebriated’ freshman testified, “I went into the inauguration thinking it was going to be pretty corny, but, by the end, I was very happy to be at Reed.”
