The sky burst into colors that cool day in December. Confetti, champagne, and obscenely bright spandex transformed the entrance to the library into a sea of raving madmen. I tried take in every sight and sound, but the sheer mass of information sent me reeling. I know that I stumbled through the crowd dodging the burning ashes of thesis drafts and champagne-soaked seniors, but all other details escape me.

After six thesis parades, I&#8217;ve probably been showered in gallons of champagne, dusted with pounds of glitter, and engaged in more drunken shenanigans in front of my professors than I would care to admit (sociology professor Marc Schneiberg called me a man-whore after the last one). Yet, I don&#8217;t think that I ever properly understood the event; it was the last opportunity to be loud and drunk before finals and little more. Only now, knowing that the next one will be mine, have I been able to grasp at its meaning.

I was left wide-eyed and exhausted when the crowd finally dispersed in front of Eliot Hall.

Staggering toward the quad, I caught up with a friend of mine that would graduate in the spring.

Though she wore only a tattered dress and a pair of boots she seemed to exude confidence and power in every step she took. Her strength left me awestruck; how, I wondered, could one walk away from that parade so calm and collected?

Because that is not how I feel. Piles of pages and problem sets stand between this day and the plane that will take me away from Portland. My apartment is cold, my love life is effectively non-existent, and I haven&#8217;t cooked myself a fresh meal since Thanksgiving. The tasks before me seem monumental, and my resources appear miniscule in comparison. Despair threatens to break through the doors and flood the room at any moment.

Yet ours is a novel situation. We construct and engage in this work willingly, deliberately taking on more than we can handle and putting on a semblance of panic in order that we may work all the harder. When I look at the situation seriously I know that I have done this to myself, and that if I didn&#8217;t want to I would have left a long time ago. For the reward to this life of labor is a familiarity with madness, an intimate knowledge of the emotional vortex that emerges in the depths of winter and isolation.

The senior I encountered in my freshman year possessed such calm and self-assurance because she had been a part of the whirlwind for four years. Tossing herself headlong into thesis parade was natural, normal; it was just as she lived daily at Reed. I had just become so concerned with my own work that I lost the ability to see beyond the edges of my textbook.

Looking beyond the structures we&#8217;re comfortable with can be unnerving. I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll be after May, and even this slight bit of uncertainty can fill me with dread. But I know that when I head to the library tomorrow afternoon, champagne in hand, I will walk without fear or hesitation. I will breathe deep in euphoria and give my best farewell to those classmates who will soon face the world.

If I can brave the turmoil of this place, I can steel myself against anything that lies beyond the borders of Reed College.
