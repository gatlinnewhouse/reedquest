**_Tangled_, Disney
  
Rating: PG
  
Running Time: 92 minutes**

It’s hard to believe that Disney has only made fifty “canon” animated feature films in the company’s history as the monopolizer of animated movies, but everyone’s favorite production company is clocking in the big five-oh with _Tangled &#8211;_ and it’s not to be missed. Not only are the CGI effects awe-inspiring, the story itself has a magical level of heartfeltness that is true to the Disney we fell in love with all those years ago. Quirky but classic, this fairytale weaves an inspired story that is both funny and beautiful. Don’t let the campy trailers fool you: this one’s a keeper.

There is nothing remarkably original about this movie (aside from the stunning visuals), and it heavily borrows elements from films like _The Little Mermaid_, _Beauty and the Beast_, and _Aladdin_.

But _Tangled_ unabashedly revels in its conventional storyline. A retelling of the Grimm Brothers’ _Rapunzel_, _Tangled_ has everything you used to expect from a Disney film pre-1995: lots of catchy musical numbers, an evil stepmother, and a cute animal sidekick. The only twist is that Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) falls for not a prince, but a thief who calls himself Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi).

Rapunzel wants nothing more than to watch up close the “floating lights” which she sees from her window every year on her birthday, knowing that there must be some significance between their annual occurrence and the reason why she is kept locked up in a tower 24/7. She also possesses absurdly lengthy locks of magical hair. Rider happens upon her skyscraper-level abode while on the run from palace guards, and after being kidnapped and coerced into helping arrange her temporary escape, the two find themselves caught up in a whirlwind adventure and, of course, fall in love.

Of course, not everything is smooth sailing (is it ever in a Disney film?), so prepare for some pretty interesting plot developments. It’s no Pixar movie, but you can rest assured that there is still the signature Disney guarantee of happily ever after.

Some viewers will be irked by the obvious similarity to other films, but it is important to watch _Tangled_ with an open mind to appreciate it for what it is: a feel-good fairytale that you can revisit again and again to pick up your spirits when real life gets kind of blue. So while the progressive world has moved beyond the girly princess rescue tale, it’s nice to know that this guilty pleasure is still there to inject a little belief in the magical into daily life. Fairytales teach us to dream and imagine beyond what seems possible, and thankfully, Disney has not forgotten this fact. Though there have been dark moments in the production company’s history of filmmaking (_Chicken Little_: need I say more?), Disney seems to be regaining their footing once more.

**_Faster_, CBS Films
  
Rating: R
  
Running Time: 95 minutes**

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is Ultimate Man. He’s so brolic that he could jack your car, blow up your house, kill your dog, run off with your wife and kids, and sucker punch you in the face&#8230; and you’d pay him a hundred bucks to do it. At six-foot-four and God knows how many pounds, he is a bulky mass of sheer muscle and strength. You do not want to mess with him, because you will have a zero percent survival rate. He is fierce, he is intimidating.

The Rock is also known for making poor decisions in choosing roles (hello, _The Tooth Fairy_?). As audience members, we have watched an actor who takes himself way too stumble awkwardly from one role to the next (with the occasional redeeming part, like Agent 23 in _Get Smart_ or self-obsessed wannabe actor/personal security guard Elliot Wilhelm in _Be Cool_), and it has been a painful journey at best. Alternating between trying too hard and giving cringe-worthy performances, Johnson’s shaky career has been a rollercoaster ride of bad, worse, sort of okay, and inconceivably ridiculous (have you seen _The Game Plan_ or _Race to Witch Mountain_?).

So, it’s nice to see The Rock playing a role that finally seems to suit him. _Faster_ is a kicking-ass-and-taking-names kind of action flick that is all business, but still doesn’t take itself too seriously.

Johnson plays Driver, a man recently released from prison and on a mission to hunt down and assassinate all members of the group responsible for his brother’s murder. On his tail is a cop (Billy Bob Thornton) on the verge of retirement, a mysterious assassin with some sort of compulsive mental disorder, and his own feelings of guilt and responsibility for what happened to his brother. As he makes his way through the list of victims, Driver finds himself struggling more and more to come to terms with his actions and justify his manhunt. Meanwhile, the cop and assassin have their own personal issues to sort out, and as the chase intensifies, all sorts of unexpected curveballs come flying out of the woodwork.

Taking obvious cues from grindhouse films (and a serious shout-out to _Kill Bill_), _Faster_ polishes up the genre, giving it a glamorous coating of Hollywood sparkle and shine, and spares no expense in staying extremely busy. There is not a single dull moment in the entire film, which is exactly what you want out of this kind of movie. And it’s not just a “bro” movie; it’s got plenty of sex appeal for all sorts of fans. If The Rock isn’t your type of stud, you are introduced to Oliver Jackson-Cohen, one very fit and handsome British actor who plays the role of Killer. Killer is an assassin hired to take out Driver, and his suave style of dress and sleek cars will have panties across the nation hitting cinema floors. The creators of _Faster_ were no dummies when it came to casting this gentleman, and he is even described in the movie as “beautiful&#8230;like a movie star.” _Faster_ is definitely able to laugh at itself, which makes it all the more endearing to watch.

_Faster_ subtly hints at a level of comedy that puts you at ease and in the right place to just sit back and enjoy following one revenge-thirsty man on his bloody killing spree. Completely comfortable with itself, _Faster_ tosses in elements of sentimentality for cinematic balance, but mainly focuses on testosterone-feuled high-speed car chases in sweet rides and beating the living daylights out of bad guys. Of course, The Rock isn’t on the side of the law &#8211; that would make for a seriously lame movie &#8211; but he’s one of the criminals you love because someone did him wrong and he’s out to get even. With the flawless work ethic of Jason Bourne and the campy jock attitude of Vin Diesel in xXx, Johnson has finally found his stride as a hardened killer who is starting to develop a conscience.

_Faster_ has a moral, but it’s far from original and really more or less a backdrop to the glorious fighting action and insane driving. The plot essentially serves as a weak adhesive holding together the intersecting lives of three men all hellbent on “finishing the job,” which is a paraphrased way of saying “putting a bullet in somebody’s head.” But as an audience member, you really don’t care. You just want to see The Rock kick some guy’s ass in the most epic way possible, and it doesn’t matter why they’ve got beef in the first place. _Faster_ is one action movie cliché after the next, all strung together to make a thoroughly enjoyable shoot-em’-up. For those of you who can’t wait until summer to watch stuff blow up on the big screen, this is exactly what the doctor ordered.
