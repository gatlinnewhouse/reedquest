In solidarity with the “Occupy Wall Street” protests taking place in New York City, citizens of Portland will be holding a “Occupy Portland” protest. At noon today (Thursday the 6<sup>th</sup>), those assembled will march from Tom McCall Park at 1020 SW Naito Parkway to Pioneer Square, then back to the Waterfront, which they plan to occupy as long as they can.

A central goal of this occupation, like its counterparts in other major cities across the country, is to challenge the monopoly on power that it believes is held by America&#8217;s elite. Occupyportland.org, the official website of the protest, declares, “[we] will no longer sit back watching corporate and special interests run their government. We are citizens of the United States, and this country is ours. We will take it back.” The movement does not have distinct demands, but expects its goals to come about naturally from direct democracy, which will involve all those present at the protests. According to occupyportland.org, protestors “will assemble&#8230;to demonstrate peaceful, substantive democracy and work for real change.”

Reed students are participating in the protests both through activist groups and as individuals. Blue Heron Collective ****will be getting a van to shuttle Reed students to the site of the protest this afternoon. They will also be distributing information pertaining a “Know Your Rights” pamphlet, as well as a pamphlet providing information on sexual assault (particularly pertaining to demonstrations). They are also providing limited amounts of food and camping gear for protestors. Though other Reed activist groups will not acting as groups, they will be represented, according to Samuel Law &#8217;14, a member of Blue Heron and Greenboard. Law also noted that other campus groups could potentially provide resources–Backpack Co-op, for example could provide camping gear.

Law believes that Reedies can take a significant role in these protests. “We do have to be students, but we can, as students, try to make sure that this can go on as long as possible.” As far as the duration and scope of the protest, he was optimistic: “Given the enthusiasm I&#8217;ve seen, it could conceivably go on for a month or so.”

However, others express concern that the movement will not accomplish anything. “While some of the ideas people are expressing are good,” said one anonymous sophomore, “I don&#8217;t think the protest will get anything done. It&#8217;s too unorganized and vague.” Faced with little progress, the protest may peter out sooner than some expect.

Reedies who wish to participate in Occupy Wall Street need only show up and respect the commitment of the movement to nonviolence. According to Emily Due of Blue Heron Collective, specifics of transportation will have been decided by Wednesday, after the Quest goes to print. Interested students can contact Blue Heron by email at [&#x62;&#x6c;&#x75;&#x65;&#x2d;&#x68;&#x65;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x2d;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x66;&#x6f;&#x73;&#x68;&#x6f;&#x70;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1].
