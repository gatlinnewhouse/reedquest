Whilst studying Ancient Egypt in Hum 110 last week, some freshman residents of Old Dorm Block might have felt a little closer to the study material than they cared for. One of the ten biblical plagues, that of lice and nits, descended onto Kerr in the terrifying form of the common bedbug. Rooms had to be evacuated, possessions fumigated, and beds burned.

“It was fucking terrible,” says freshman Erin McConnell. “I didn’t even have bedbugs in my room, but since my roommate found them, they fumigated my room too out of precaution. All of my work was gone for two days, and everything that made my room feel like home was gone.”

There are a number of symptoms that signal a bedbug infestation. First of all, anyone who wakes up with mysterious bites on their body has every right to be suspicious that bed bugs – and hopefully not their roommate – may be the cause. Blood stains on sheets may also be a sign of bed bugs. One sure sign of bed bugs is small stains resembling ink blots on sheets and pillowcases. Unless you were getting frisky with your typewriter last night, those inky stains are a sure sign of a bed bug infestation.

If a bedbug infestation does occur, students should not panic; there will be a couple of not-very-fun days ahead, but certain precautions must be taken to prevent the spread of the bug. “Pack the things you want to keep throughout the fumigation in plastic bags, and of course, tell someone as soon as you think you might have an infestation,” McConnell says. HAs, RDs, or CSO officers will be more than willing to notify the right people.

Bedbugs were first seen in Portland in 2008, reported _OregonLive_ on Wednesday, and the problem has been growing dramatically. Bedbugs are costly for property owners: A property-management company told _OregonLive_ that it spent $50,000 to treat a 100-unit project of one-bedroom apartments. ODB, by comparison, contains 54 singles, 32 doubles, and one triple.
