Weapons of Mass Distraction (WMD) would like to officially thank the Reed community for bringing up issues of appropriation last semester. We have listened to your concerns and are trying to construct productive changes within our group in order to respectfully acknowledge the cultures from which we draw. We have discussed these issues as a troupe and decided it is deeply important that we find a way to address the harm we cause within the community and seek to alleviate the harm we cause. We are educating ourselves, both individually and as a group. We plan to take the time to make these decisions carefully. If you have any further criticisms or suggestions for how we may conduct ourselves, we would greatly appreciate hearing from you at wmdreed@gmail.com.
