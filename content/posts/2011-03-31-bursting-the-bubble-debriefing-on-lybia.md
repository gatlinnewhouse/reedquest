The democratic revolutions sweeping through the Middle East have come to a violent hurdle. While the first weeks of protest in Tunisia and Egypt were relatively non-violent, in the recent weeks, rulers in Yemen, Syria, Bahrain, and Libya have cracked down with greater force to suppress the anti-government efforts.

In Yemen, nearly 200 people have been killed since protests began and the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh is trying tighten its grip on the populace as it precipitously falls apart.  The cabinet of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad resigned and the other concessions have been promised, but that alone is little evidence of positive change for the protestors. At least 60 individuals have died in clashes with government forces with thousands others marching on the capital city Damascus, hoping the president’s speech on Wednesday brings legitimate change.

In Bahrain, protest was literally and symbolically smothered when the famous monument in the center of Pearl Square torn down by government officials.

The violence in all these countries have been disheartening for supporters of democracy and human rights, but none of these nations have received more publicity in the last few weeks than Libya. Under the autocratic rule of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya has been kept tribally divided with a pretense of stability only in place due to the strict rule of law. Among the many unhinged and unsettling decisions Qaddafi has made over the years are his calls to eliminate Switzerland and force all the youth in Libya to read his Green Book, where he supposedly explains the solutions to democracy, economics and society in three easy sections. Recently however, with the Libyan population protesting for greater democracy and freedom, Qaddafi has become more threatening, with a promise to violently suppress any anti-government rebellions that come his way.

Qaddafi’s government has kept such promises, and with the rebel anti-government forces occupying the eastern region of Libya, violence has erupted into what may or may not be a civil war or a ruthless crackdown on protesting forces. We will not truly know what the confrontation consists of until after it is all over, if at all. Regardless, Western powers, including France, Britain and the United States, spoke publicly against such violence by a government against its people and have taken action.

With the government forces putting significant pressure on the inadequately armed rebels, the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize multilateral military action to protect Libyan civilians from the violence. This sanctioned offensive, initially supported by the Arab League, quickly lost much of this support after US and NATO forces began airstrikes on the Libyan government’s forces, arguing the West was overstepping its boundaries from what the UN allowed. Nonetheless, the West has continued to shell Qaddafi forces, and this air support has allowed the rebels to move quickly through Libya, taking several key cities in their march towards Tripoli, the countries capital.

On Monday the 28th, President Obama addressed the US, arguing his case for intervention in Libya, even though the country is currently in the midst of two wars in the Middle East, is dealing with an internal job crisis, and received no Senate support. He argued that the world will be safer with the Libyan people protected from what he worried was a genocide, and stated that the United States had an internationally responsibility to prevent such a massacre. Obama called for the removal of Qaddafi from power in Libya, but stressed that NATO rather than the US would lead the multilateral intervention, and not include any American troops on the ground.
