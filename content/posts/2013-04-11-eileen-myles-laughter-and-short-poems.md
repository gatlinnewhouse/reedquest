“If you were waiting for the poem, that was it,” said Eileen Myles after reading the two lines of her poem, “Tree,” to open last Thursday night’s poetry reading. The comment was met by laughter from 60 or so people gathered in the Eliot Chapel, and set the precedent for an unpredictable hour of poetry, ranging from a lengthy poem discussing theology to a poem entitled “Paint Me A Penis.” Although the hallowed halls of the Eliot Chapel were slow to yield applause and snaps never once seemed appropriate, laughter was frequent, and the poet held her audience spellbound.

Drawing upon a quote from Myles’s novel, _Inferno_: “Awards are the only currency American writing has to describe a writer’s work. It’s almost French_,_” Visiting Professor of Creative Writing Samiya Bashir went on to recount the many of the awards Myles has received, including a Warhol Foundation/Creative Capital, Arts Writers Grant, three Lambda Book Awards, a Shelley Award from the Poetry Society of America, and, most recently, a Guggenheim Fellowship to work on a memoir, _Afterglow_. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she moved to New York in 1974 to become a poet. Since then, she has written 18 books of poetry, prose, and criticism. Her other work includes serving as artistic director of Saint Mark’s Poetry Project in the mid-80s, editing a volume entitled _The New Fuck You: Adventures in Lesbian Reading_, and taught in many settings, most recently Columbia and NYU. Bashir concluded by calling Myles “outrageously fierce” and “enjoys living and creating the poet’s life” before handing over the microphone to allow her to do just that.

When the poem following “Tree” was met with apparent puzzlement, she read a poem entitled “BP,” reading, in part, “…‘weird’ is the mitten / I keep my normal _in_ / so there,” and everyone was on the same page. She read a poem about a baby asking her grandfather for coffee, in which the old man responds “now you’re talking,” which had been rejected from the _New Yorker_, then described her experience of seeing some Reed graffiti of two penises next to each other and captioned with “Yay Sex,” before discussing another topic familiar to many Reedies: the differences between the East and West Coasts.

She described learning how to write in bustling New York City before relocating to the California and having to reteach herself how to write in a new, more sparse landscape. Her 2012 book _Snowflake (new poems)/Different Streets (newer poems)_ that she read from next was written during the process of returning to New York, saying, “It’s basically two books fucking each other” (make what you will of it being a flip book). Her anxiety about whether she would be able to revert to her earlier New York style of writing was quelled by being in love, a state during which, she said, all writing comes easily.

“The Perfect Faceless Fish,” written during endless tarmac delays and layovers on a cross-country voyage, described a situation in which neither her nor her girlfriend wants to cook dinner because they both want to avoid ‘being the woman’ and what their meal would say if it were to start talking. The visceral “My Box” concluded “I want to be / loved like / a sunbeam / that is / it comes / across the room / or the ocean / you know the / way I drive / I want to lift / your fear / like a bonnet / and kiss / your living / face. Here /this is / mine. Don’t / misunderstand / me.”

“I’m like a failed sex worker,” Myles shared anecdotally. “The one time I was a sex worker I didn’t ask to get paid—I was too embarrassed. So I just had sex.”

When Myles reads poetry she speaks as she normally does, with the same power, tone, and pace with which she shares her anecdotes – and also, as it turns out, her prose. Reading from her novel _Inferno_, she offered a glimpse into the life and mind of a poet named Eileen Myles:

“How cold it was to be up all night, alone, thinking about a woman while the morning turned blue. I was burning. It was like I took a bolt of lightning and stabbed the world. And I was still shaking from the attack. Later one of the guys whose workshop I was in (Bill Zavatsky) told me that my poems were second-rate Sappho. I was stunned, but you know I could have cared less. It was what I was _in_. Later on I published these poems as _Sappho’s Boat_ to make damn sure everyone knew what I meant. But look.”

“I’ll show you the page. The thing that happened in the new poems was this feeling I had that Sappho was like an overhead view of water across which something had moved, and you could see it like this. Dip your finger into the water, causing a spiral. And how would you preserve a pattern like that…it would be to pick points along the swirling line almost like a constellation that would simply indicate the movement without representing every little bit.”

Even though she thought she had been reading for too long, Reedies in attendance asked for her to continue with some dog poetry she has been working on more recently—to which she happily obliged. The long complex poem “My Father Came Again as a Dog” describes a hypothetical world with a higher power called ‘Dog’ in which we are fish. We, the audience, were told, “there is sea, there is Dog” and were then instructed to ask ourselves if we “are brave enough to see this thirst as longing.”

A fruitful question and answer session followed in which the poet elaborated on her poetic method, describing it as “the voiceover for the times I couldn’t speak.”

Of her erratic language, she said “meter is for the English; it’s not the English we speak in America. There’s a different flow to the language.” She said that not everything in her poetry is equally important, not every word is stressed, explaining that she had been to many poetry readings and noted the distractions she had to deal with, the trailing away of her thoughts, making it unrealistic to ask anyone to follow every stressed syllable. Reading poetry in the deliberate, monotone voice in which it is often—perhaps stereotypically—read, she said, is not allowing the listener to trust you, as you become the voice of authority. “Any important message is full of loss.”

When asked how she chooses which moments to include in her poems, she replied simply: “they choose me.”

Myles concluded this year’s visiting writers series, the fifth poet and eighth writer overall. Creative Writing Professors Samiya Bashir and Pete Rock asked the poets and prose writers, respectively, to give readings at Reed over the course of the year. “We want people who can engage listeners with their work,” says Bashir, noting Myles fantastic reading ability as one of the main reasons for asking her to come to Reed.

“Reed gives us the opportunity to see artists that we would otherwise not be able to see, and different opportunities to engage with what we’re working on,” says Bashir. When Erica Doyle, the first visiting writer of the semester, came to Reed she brought various drafts from points in the revision process. It was her first published collection, but she had been crafting a career as a poet for many years and the collection amounted to about ten years of work, providing an amazing opportunity for members of the revision class offered this semester to better understand the process.

Her creative writing classes also studied Myles and in the lead up to her reading. In an informal question conversation held in Winch before the reading, English majors and others were able to discuss poetry with Myles. “We talked about how you know what good poetry is”, says Bashir, adding that Myles did not hold back her opinions on that controversial topic and others. “We also discussed how she’s been able to craft a career for herself as a poet, coming to an understanding that the [artistic] community survives by being supportive of each other. The artists get a lot from talking with people who are studying them closely; we’re able to help make art happen.”

“These readings are for all of us,” says Bashir. “They are open to everyone and more people should become involved.” She was already looking at work from poets who will be reading next year; including Carl Phillips, winner of the 2011 Los Angeles Times Book Award in Poetry; Paisley Rekdal, winner of a Village Voice Writers on the Verge Award; Natalie Diaz, a former professional basketball player and winner a Nimrod/Hardman Pablo Neruda Prize for Poetry; Kazim Ali, a multitalented novelist and poet; and Alice Notley, who over her forty years of writing poetry has been a finalist for the Pulitzer, won the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Poetry, and the prestigious Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize for the best volume of poetry written by a living U.S. citizen and published in the previous year in the United States.

For those who simply cannot wait for next year’s visiting writers series to talk poetry, Bashir hosts a weekly Poetry Salon Tuesdays from 3:30-5:00 in GCC-B. The meetings are open to all students who want to read works by their favorite poets, share their own work, or just discuss poetry.
