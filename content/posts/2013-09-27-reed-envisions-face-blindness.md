Imagine not being able to recognize your own mother. For the majority of the population, this simple task is second nature. However, for those like Dr. Holly Hinson, who presented a lecture on face blindness this past Thursday, such associations are not so simple.

“I won’t go with her. I just start sobbing,” recounted Hinson, relating a difficult childhood story of her experience with face blindness, “I refuse to accompany this strange woman. And it broke my mom’s heart; she felt like her daughter didn’t love her anymore, and I just didn’t know who the hell this strange woman was.”

Hinson, a neurologist at Oregon Health & Science University, spoke to a small crowd of students and professors this past Thursday in Psychology 136 about a condition known as prosopagnosia, and most commonly referred to as face blindness. Not only is Hinson well versed in the science behind the condition, she is also a member of the small portion of the population effected by prosopagnosia. Hinson’s form of the disorder is developmental, and she has suffered from face blindness from an early age. However, she, like many other prosopagnosics, knew little of the disorder until well until her medical career, and was not actually diagnosed with the condition until adulthood.

“It wasn’t until much later that I realized that I actually have the condition, and pretty profoundly.”

The neurologist began her presentation, “Eyes Without a Face,” with an anecdote of an awkward prosopagnosia-related incident involving a misidentified patient from her residency at the University of Maryland. Believing she was speaking to a man who had been brought in after a standoff with the police the night before, Hinson spent several minutes telling a very confused patient that he had tested positive for cocaine after being arrested and forcefully detained. Only after checking the man’s wristband did she realize that the patient she was actually looking for was several doors down.

“The only thing I can think to do is scream, ‘Disregard!’ and sprint out of the room,” reminisced Hinson, “This can be a disabling condition in a lot of ways, despite what your profession is.”

Prosopagnosia can be either developmental or acquired; the difference between developmental and acquired prosopagnosia is that developmental happens in utero and is present from birth, whereas acquired is the result of some sort of cranial trauma or other exterior factor. Prosopagnosia is linked to an area in the brain known as the fusiform gyrus, located on both the temporal and occipital lobes. “Face blindness” turns out to actually be somewhat of a misleading title, since the condition does not impair the patient’s vision, but rather his or her ability to match specific faces with individuals.

“It’s not that you see Picasso faces every time you look at people’s faces,” explained Hinson, “it’s that the association of the information is impaired.”

To give a taste of how prosopagnosia operates, Hinson flashed a slide featuring six different celebrity faces, all flipped upside-down. The average human brain has trouble identifying inverted faces, and much like a prosopagnosic would have difficulty linking a face with a name, many audience members were slow to identify the famous faces.

Hinson utilized many such examples throughout her lecture, using pictures and analogies to try to make clear just how her condition works. Using a nice mixture of hard data, cultural references, and personal anecdotes, Hinson managed to emphasize both the scientific and social implications of prosopagnosia.

By the end of the presentation, audience members were eager to quiz Dr. Hinson on some of the latest research being done in the field. Students and professors asked about the relationship between autism and prosopagnosia, the use of MRIs and other technology in clinical research, strategies for training prosopagnosics to better cope with their impairment, and other potential experiments that might help doctors better understand the disorder.

Hinson’s personal relation with prosopagnosia gives her a unique place in the field. Not only does she know the science behind the condition, but she also understands just what it’s like to stand in front of a room filled with foreign faces. Yet, despite her impressive knowledge on the subject, Hinson closed with an acknowledgement of the work that remains to be done in the field.

“You guys are full of fantastic research projects,” said Hinson. “I would really like to learn more about this.”
