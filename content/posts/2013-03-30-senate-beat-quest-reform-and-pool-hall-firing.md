**Announcements**

The Bookstore Board met on Thursday to discuss finances. Textbook sales have been down since 2007, but an increase in used book sales makes up for this. The board discussed reducing its use of plastic bags by charging 25 cents per bag, and giving customers who bring their own bags 25 cents off per bag. Since the installment of cameras in the bookstore, theft has decreased and eight thieves have been caught, some of which have stolen from other bookstores as well.

The ad hoc committee on Paideia met this past week. Student Body President Ari Galper has sent out surveys to faculty and staff concerning their opinions on Paideia-related issues. Galper said he would soon send out surveys to the student body: “I encourage all you homeboys and girls to take it as well.”

The Residence Life committee has talked to Director of Facilities Services Townsend Angell about constructing a covered bike storage area on campus. Plans are under way to surround the current bike storage area by the cross-canyon dorms with brick and plexiglass.

The Triggering Events committee wrote a rough draft of guidelines for student groups to follow prior to events. Senator Ben Goggin says the purpose of the guidelines is to help student groups, “protect themselves against flack they may get and to protect victims and people who might be sensitive.” He clarified, “It’s not censoring them but it’s helping to forewarn people who might be sensitive to it.”

**Quest Reform**

According to Galper, since the student body voted to allow the appointment process for _Quest_ editors to be changed, the trustees have not yet passed changes to the Student Body constitution. He projects that they will pass the changes when they meet at Reed in April.

The current editorial board distributed a written outline of its proposals for reform, which included that the board itself appoints new editors each semester, instead of the student body electing the board. _Quest_ editor Kieran Hanrahan listed the board’s motivations behind the changes: “To encourage institutional memory, to avoid special elections fiascos that we had to go through last year because we didn’t receive quorum even though we were the only ones running, to encourage a sense of ownership over the _Quest_ for current editors so that they feel more invested in what they are doing.”

Senator John Iselin says, “I have been _Quest_ liason for a year, and I am really in favor of the change. It is important to note that Reed College is one of the few if any that runs on an election process rather than an internal appointments process.” He says that within an appointments system “you have to work your way up, express interest, and gain experience with a number of things.”

Student Body Vice President Paul Messick brought up that _The_ _Quest_ is funded by the Student Body, and therefore has a certain responsibility to be kept accountable. He also said of the proposed recall process, “To require twenty percent [of the student body to petition] is too high.” Hanrahan responded that Senate would be able to revoke _Quest_ funds at any time if they were unsatisfied. He also agreed that the recall threshold is too high, but said that twenty percent is the number for other elected officials, so the problem is with the recall process in general.

Senator David Azrael argued that it is a minor inconvenience for _Quest_ editors to run for their position. He said that even if a board does not reach quorum, _The_ _Quest_ still can operate as an unofficial board to put out a paper. But he said the ideal _Quest_ would be an arts and culture magazine: “You can’t keep up with news.” On the other hand, Iselin argued, “I think there is news happening and having that recorded is powerful.”

The discussion returned to the proposal of internal appointments when Iselin argued for the value in people deciding what they do and don’t like by spending time working for _The Quest_ prior to becoming editors. “The elections process discourages talent,” he says.

Similarly, Hanrahan explained, “We have been fortunate with _Quest_ boards over the past five years, but if you go further back, the quality deteriorates. We are trying to extend that as long as we can.”

Former Senator Sarah Carlisle argued, “The quality of _The Quest_ is subjective judgment…If editors work hard they can create some sort of memory so that the next editors can decide to continue what they did if they want.”

**Pool Hall**

On the Wednesday of Spring Break, the Pool Hall went through a spring cleaning session. “No one wants to be the first person to smoke a cigarette in there,” Pool Hall Manager Molly Kimball says. She does not foresee Reed being fined after the upcoming visit of the Multnomah County health inspector: “What they wanted to see was significant improvement, and there was significant improvement.”

The Pool Hall is planning to hold a community discussion on indoor smoking in the near future.

Concerning the recent firing of former Pool Hall manager Kevin Schmidt,  Carlisle said, “I was shocked because I didn’t think anybody except the student body had powers to fire a student…the only way to be removed was by senate voting on it.”

Director of Student Activities Kristin Holmberg clarified, “I know over time the Judicial Board has removed an SU manager and maybe a Paradox manager.”

Carlisle also pointed out that senate could have begun discussing the issue much earlier if Schmidt had come to senate and asked for help in his situation.

Former Senator and Student Body Vice President Aidan Sigman added, “I think it’s obscene that Karma is being used as a punishment. Everyone that is doing it is doing it voluntarily. I personally would not want someone who is not excited about taking care of me to be taking care of me.”

Current Pool Hall managers are still relying heavily on the guidance of fomer managers Schmidt and Wren Kominos-Marvell to understand how to do the job.

Head Treasurer Chris Weber said the treasury was not made aware that Schmidt was fired: “He has been getting paid all semester.” Senator Mat Olson says, “Senate needs to be informed. It should be made clear to everyone in this process that we need to be informed so that accounting errors don’t happen. It wasn’t brought to us by anybody until there was talk of the _Quest_ article.”
