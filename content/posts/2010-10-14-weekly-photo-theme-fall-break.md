Love photography but feeling uninspired? Think you took a shot that other people might enjoy? Whether you have a passion for photography or just want to share a snap shot with the rest of the Reed community, this is your chance. The Reed Photography Theme of the Week is a space that aims to provide ideas that hopefully will inspire Reedies who are otherwise preoccupied with overwhelming obligations to take a break by observing the world and imprinting it in photograph form. A theme will be announced weekly, and select submissions will be shown in the printed version of the Quest; all submissions will also be available as a slideshow in the online version of the Quest.

The theme for this week is Fall Break. What is the world like outside of the bubble? Wherever you may be journeying to, take your camera with you and try to capture what it is that defines your Fall Break. Email submissions to either [&#x72;&#x61;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x6a;&#x61;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1] or [&#x6a;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x6c;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][2].
