About 30% of the contents of a typical trashcan is compostable. Far from being just a random heap of empty plastic pens, candy wrappers, and the occasional hapless high-school freshman, the trash is also a graveyard for unwanted food scraps, used napkins, and pizza boxes. Although high-school freshmen are typically not compostable, much of the other contents have a higher calling beyond the landfill.

Reed’s cutting-edge waste-management system started as a pilot program through the City of Portland. Since 2008, the college has been recycling and composting everything from past issues of The Quest to leftover grass clippings. Every scrap of foliage and organic waste produced by Reed’s grounds management is either repurposed or composted directly on campus. Branches are chipped and used on trails; grass and leaves are mulched back into the ground; and weeds are composted on-site. Reed bears all of the costs for doing this, with no assistance from the City.

Commons, in cooperation with Reed as well as according to its own values, composts all the unwanted food that passes through its kitchen. Both unused leftovers and food scraps are scraped into a bin, and eventually shipped to Cedar Grove Compost in Seattle for processing. Used cooking oil is sent for processing into bio-diesel that Reed purchases back to fuel grounds-keeping equipment.

Commons even has a machine that uses centrifugal force to remove the moisture from paper scraps such as napkins and food packaging. The paper is then sent to Waste Management for recycling.

Composting and recycling are both effective ways of reducing the amount of waste we produce. Compost can be reborn as fertilizer, and recycled materials can be given new lives as virtually anything, thereby reducing the need for more raw materials and slowing the buildup of trash in landfills.

Townsend “Towny” Angell is the director of Facilities Operations and a member of the Sustainability Committee at Reed. To Angell, composting is as obvious and natural as it could possibly be. “It’s just a no-brainer,” he says. “There isn’t an endless amount of space to be throwing crap into.”

In October 2011, the City of Portland introduced a new waste-management system to its residents. Now, instead of picking up the trash every week, it is picked up every other week and a brand-new composting program picks up the slack. Residents are encouraged to place compostable materials in their yard-debris bin, which is now picked up every week to offset the reduced garbage service. The City of Portland states that the intent of this change is to reduce waste, create fertilizer, and encourage awareness of the environment.

Many city residents are upset by this, arguing that they will have to either buy bigger trash cans to accommodate for the less frequent pickup, or deal with the stench and associated rodent infestation that could arise from the rotting food scraps left to sit in the bins.

Another source of malaise is the location of a planned processing plant that will deal with the compost. The City proposes to put it in Lents, a low-income neighborhood of Portland four miles to the east of Reed. Residents complain about what is likely to be a smelly and unsightly new facility, and have appealed the case to a state tribunal.

On the topic of the complaints from Portland’s residents, Angell reminds us that “nobody likes it when you change things.” But Portland seems to be taking an important step toward following Reed’s example in sustainability and environmental awareness.
