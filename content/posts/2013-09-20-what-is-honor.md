I want to instigate a community-wide discussion about what does the Honor Principle ‘really’ mean. This discussion should happen and needs to happen on the level of individuals and their peer groups.

Our understanding of the Honor Principle cannot be a top-down procedure; nor should it be something as radically individualistic as the version found in the Honor Council Code.

… the Honor Principle entrusts the responsibility of acting in accordance with one’s **personal sense of right or wrong** to each member of the Reed Community (Student Body Constitution, 1919)…

I am unsatisfied because of the chosen words, “personal sense.” What does it mean for me to have a “personal sense” of ethics and where is this “personal sense” coming from? Should we decide the meaning of the Honor Principle based on what each of us individually think is right?

I fear that as a community we are accepting the simplistic idea that “the Honor Principle is _my individual_ sense of what is right and wrong.”

You might ask, “Why should it matter if the Honor Principle has been become whatever _I_ say it is?”

It matters because the Honor Principle is that which _governs_ us. It matters because when every individual is king—when every individual is an authority unto himself or herself—a community governed by Honor will cease to exist.

Living under the Honor Principle should mean at least two things: 1. _Embodying_ the spirit of the Honor Principle in every meaningful decision you make as a member of Reed’s community and 2. Approaching every conflict you have with another person with the intent to fully understand their perspective—even if it is foreign from your own.
  
Embodiment is not simply thinking of the Honor Principle, embodiment is a set of _individual_ lived practices which accord to an _intuitive sense_ of what the Reed Community feels is “right or wrong”—“honorable” or “dishonorable.”

Embodiment means habituating oneself to the sense that “it isn’t all about me”—being able to automatically gauge the consequences of every action. Embodied Honor is cleaning your room at the end of the year because you know that there are _other human beings_ who will be forced to clean up your mess. Embodied Honor is taking accountability for _your_ broken champagne bottles at Renn Fayre; it is taking accountability for _your_ cigarette butts and empty beers that _you_ left on the front lawn; and it is taking accountability for readings, lab reports, and mid-terms that you committed yourself to when you signed up for classes.

In short embodied honor is about living as an adult in this community—it is learning to be capable and accountable.

Lastly: Conflict Resolution. To me Honor is a matter of calm and honest confrontation. Meaning an approach to every conflict with the knowledge that _you_ and the _other_ come from different and even contradictory perspectives; that you and the other have different accounts and narratives to explain the same event; that you and the other have different life experiences and values which shape how you filter and judge the same event; and that you and the other do not understand each other—yet.
  
Despite the difficulties and challenges of communication, it is really possible to arrive at shared and common ground. We all share common ground—whether that ground is our shared participation in the English language or our shared participation in the Honor Principle. Our goal as communicators and resolvers of conflict is to seek and to find that common ground even if it takes hours, or days, or years, or generations.
  
So please live honorably. Embody Honor. And make an effort to understand those perspectives which appear foreign.
