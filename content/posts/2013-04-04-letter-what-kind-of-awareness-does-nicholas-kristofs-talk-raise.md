Nicholas Kristof’s talk was scheduled at 7 p.m. in Reed Kaul auditorium this past Monday. The talk was open to the public, and a lot of well-dressed folks started showing up even before 6:30. Of course, people would come early to his talk because he is not only the author of the national bestseller Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women in Worldwide, but also his humanitarian work in far-flung areas of the world has “rescued” the lives of underprivileged and maltreated girls. This was also the bulk of his talk—rescuing girls in the global south.

Mr. Kristof’s talk was full of what I have come to think of as Pity Stories about underprivileged and maltreated girls from a rural village in China, a jungle in Ethiopia, a brothel in Cambodia and more. Although these stories are from different parts of the world, the formula that he used in all of his stories is the same: (1) the underprivileged one is a girl; (2) she is in the realm of suffering; (3) we (his organization, friends, and sometimes Kristof himself) rescued their lives. The descriptions of his stories are very graphic, e.g., the girl from Ethiopia was married out young, got pregnant at the age of 16, suffered a fistula, was leaking waste, as a result neglected by her husband, family, and the community, then she was thrown in a shack in a jungle, and finally she crawls all night to a clinic. His exotic narrative is saturated with emotive language and the effect of this technique viscerally and voyeuristically hit the emotions of the audience as I could tell from the sound of handclaps and tear-filled eyes of some people who were sitting near me.

But what do we really know about these girls from Kristof’s stories? Truth be told, we know nothing other than his portrayal of them as the victims of violence. Their very identities are wholly constructed and constituted by violence, or more specifically, as research fellow Elliot Freeman said, violence that can be turned into narrative. What we were hearing, watching, and even experiencing is a spectacle of violence. The stories in his talk are not really about those maltreated girls, but rather it is about his interactions with them by describing the transition of transforming their lives from the realm of suffering to the world of happiness. As a result, the narrative that is born out of these stories makes Kristof himself a celebrity and the Pity Stories leave the impression that women are powerless, voiceless objects needing savoir.

In addition, Kristof’s narrative turned these girls into only abused bodies by totally ignoring the historical, social and political situations that have animated such horrible things in the first place. By abused bodies, I mean the girls in his stories were not treated as political subjects with social agency, but rather the objects of violence. Such narrative suggests to the audience to be aware that there are abused bodies that they could go and save, but it resolutely does not suggest the audience be aware of their complicity in those abuses, or, most importantly, of the structural violence that is deeply embedded in each of these cases. The act of depoliticizing the suffering of these girls results in band-aid measures that make the donor morally feel better and reinforces the savoir and victim power relationship, but it does nothing to accomplish the structural reshaping that would lead to transformative change for all women.

Finally, this also poses some important questions to the organizations, either student-led or administrative, that brought Kristof to Reed College with the aim of raising awareness of women’s oppression in worldwide. What kind of awareness has Kristof’s stories really raised for Reed community? Other than following Kristof’s Facebook or Twitter page, or donating some cash to his organization, does our awareness of the suffering of abused bodies in the global south equip us to respond to the oppression of women conceptually or politically? Does such awareness make us more educated?
