The circumstances of Appointments Committee&#8217;s choice of Renn Fayre Czars is being contested by some members of Senate as well as members of the larger Reed community. Student Body President Nora McConnell-Johnson called the selection process a “disservice to the student body” and “unfair.”

There seem to have been two major issues with the selection: First, Appointments Committee&#8217;s vote for the czars was made in the absence of two senatorial members of the committee, and was the result of an unexpected shift of opinion by several members of Appointments Committee. The extent of that shift has been debated, as well as the significance of it.

The second issue is as follows: some have alleged that last years Renn Fayre Czars (hereafter referred to as “the RF2K11 Czars”) had already decided who they would select before the process had begun.

Czar candidate Liz Mastrengelo stated that she felt that they hadn&#8217;t appropriately considered all of the boards equally, “I believe that if every member of the committee really examined the course of decision-making in this appointment, they will find serious misgivings about the fairness of Friday’s deliberation and recommendation.”

RF2K11 Czar and current Senator Dana Loutey disagreed, “If we hadn&#8217;t taken the other team into consideration, it wouldn&#8217;t have taken so goddamn long.”

As far as what actually took place, Appointments Committee met on Thursday, October 13. Present were five senators, including Torra Spillane, Senator Annalise Bender-Brown and Appointments Committee Chair Sarah Carlisle, McConnell-Johnson, Vice Treasurer Khagemba Adhikarimayum, and the RF2K11 Czars. After almost 4 hours of deliberation, a poll was taken that heavily favored a certain group (that was not the one eventually chosen), which we will call “Group A.” Some in the room interpreted this as an all but definite decision. According to Bender-Brown, “I expressed how I felt Thursday and I assumed that was the decision to be made.”  On the other hand, RF2K11 Czar Jeremy Lawrence described the process as more like “tipping from the middle” than a definite decision.

That night, according to Lawrence, the two czars that supported Group A changed their minds in favor of the other group of potential czars, independently of each other. The voting itself is a confidential matter, but one senator on Appointments Committee was unable to attend the vote altogether due to prior engagements, and one left before the vote. It is an all but unheard of thing for Appointments Committee to be divided on any appointment. Due to a lack of a precedent or a bylaw, Appointments Committee has no definition of a Quorum (in fact, there is no codified procedure for voting in Appointments Committee), so the vote could take place without the two senators. The senators present were divided in their votes, but the decision was made. The whole process took only an hour. Many felt deep discomfort with the quick turnaround and vote. “I&#8217;m not sure the results would have been different,” said Spillane, “But the discussion was stopped. So we can&#8217;t know.”

At the Senate Meeting on Monday, October 24, senate voted to pass the recommendations of Appointments Committee, with Bender-Brown and Spillane voting against the measure, and Loutey abstaining.

Mastrangelo stated that she felt that the vote was dishonest. “I understand Senate’s desire to get the ball rolling on Spring-Fall [thesis parade], however this was a thin disguise for laziness and deference to nepotistic tradition.”

Despite the controversy surrounding the situation, the appointment of the Czars cannot be amended. Nora McConnell-Johnson and Torra Spillane, among others, expressed their confidence that the selected Czars would do a great job with Renn Fayre. What is more important is the larger issues with Appointments Committee that have been brought to light by this incident.

Spillane recommended that the process become less confidential and that appointments committee develop concrete reports that could be shared with senate. McConnell-Johnson thought that the old Czars should be moved to a non-voting, advisory role in the appointments process Czars aren&#8217;t democratically elected and thus are not accountable to the student body, which might enable them to select a group regardless of merit.

Mastrangelo echoed this concern, saying, “The student body deserves to have these positions filled based on merit, especially when it involves extensive access to student body funds.”

Others have place the expertise of the Czars in a position of primacy, and see them as central to making an informed decision about Renn Fayre. “We care a lot about Renn Fayre and we want the best people to run it,” said Loutey.

Both McConnell-Johnson and Spillane thought that simply codifying the system better would be helpful: currently, the bylaw about the workings of Appointments Committee is two sentences long, leaving the appointment process essentially based on institutional memory and ad hoc rules. In Nora&#8217;s words, “The governing documents of our student body are a mess.” Carlisle said that she thought Appointments Committee worked well in its non-codified format, but indicated that she would be open to changes in terms of the structure of Appointment Committee, “I think Appointments Committee works really well. That said, it could be made better.” Indeed, if there is an agreement in this debate, its that this issue would be a great place to begin a discussion about improvements to the Appointments Committee process.
