_eQuestrian offers alternative to reedquest.org_

**Sam Shemitz**

One thing you may not have noticed about reedquest.org, announced in these pages last week: it’s out on the public internet. This is a double-edged sword. It’s a great site, if still rough around the edges, but as a result it is one that we have to be careful with.

e-Questrian offers all the community-internal features that ReedQuest by its very nature cannot, from archives of past semesters to anonymous personal ads and polls to emailing full issues to students studying abroad. It’s not quite set up yet to publish new issues simultaneously with ReedQuest, but will be shortly. In the meantime, in case you were at all worried about the public nature of the Quest’s new online presence e-Questrian provides a safe space for private articles and comments that the Willy Week can’t see.
