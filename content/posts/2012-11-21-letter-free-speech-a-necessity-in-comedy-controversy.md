Freedom of speech is one of a handful ideals I like to think I support unequivocally. It&#8217;s easy to forget the full meaning of this freedom, refer to it glibly, or take it for granted—especially when living in a society that so often avoids touchy subjects or else buries them in layers of euphemism. For many, I think, last Saturday&#8217;s comedy performance in the SU was a reminder that this freedom is not always an easy one to affirm. I&#8217;m referring specifically to [Sal Rodriguez&#8217;s performance][1], which outraged a good portion of the audience and ended with one audience member coming up on stage, taking the microphone, and confronting him.

Sal began by talking about politics, attacking the Obama administration, government more broadly and liberalism (which he directed towards the audience&#8217;s complacency). More than specific critiques, Sal seemed more interested in simply getting a rise out of the audience, which he certainly succeeded in doing after he shifted to the subject of men and women in academia and called an audience member a &#8220;loud-mouthed cunt&#8221; (after which the audience member, quite bravely, came on stage and challenged his offensive speech in this and the previous comedy show).

I don&#8217;t want to get into issues like sexism here (though I certainly hope you do). More importantly, I don&#8217;t write this in hopes of silencing Sal—quite the opposite: I want an explanation. While we may be free to say whatever we want and, in my opinion, _should_ exercise that right precisely around issues that make us all the more reluctant to accept the immutability of that right, we need to recognize the basic practical function that makes freedom of speech so important in the first place: the need to communicate to each other and rationally justify our points of view.

In terms of putting on a comedy show I understand why MC (and comedian extraordinaire), Sean Howard intervened, but part of me wishes that he had let Sal and the audience member keep arguing on stage. I don&#8217;t know if they finished their argument afterwards, but I—and I think a lot of other audience members—would have been interested to hear it out. So, with everyone&#8217;s anger died down, I&#8217;d like to ask Sal, not rhetorically but genuinely, while entertaining the possibility that he might somehow justify himself: what were you trying to do?
