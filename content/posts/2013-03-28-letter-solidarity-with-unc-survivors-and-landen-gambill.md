_**TW: Discussion of Sexual Assault **_

Excerpt from [_Jezebel_][1]: &#8220;Last month, former University of North Carolina assistant dean of students Melinda Manning, three students and one former student [filed a complaint][2] with the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Civil Rights on behalf of themselves and 64 other unnamed sexual assault survivors, alleging that university officials pressured Manning into underreporting cases and violated the Campus Sexual Assault Victims&#8217; Bill of Rights, the Clery Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and equal opportunity mandates under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Now sophomore Landen Gambill, one of the students named in the case, says she&#8217;s being punished by the Office of Student Conduct for &#8220;intimidating&#8221; her rapist by speaking to the press about her sexual assault.&#8221;

In the wake of the recent controversy regarding the honor court process at UNC Chapel Hill, we as the Reed College Feminist Student Union, along with our fellow organizers and activists at Reed, would like to wholeheartedly offer our solidarity and support to the survivors who have been subjected to undue trauma, and have been further disempowered and silenced by faulty honor system’s recourse to victim blaming.

As this case clearly illustrates, victim-blaming mentalities are pervasive and they are often the damaging first impulse of those in positions of power who lack the proper sensitivity training and education regarding the complexities inherent in cases of domestic and sexual assault. From the reports given about both cases, it seems as though this victim-blaming mentality played a role at both stages of the case of Landin Gambill in particular: the questions Landen was asked by members of the Honor Court during her initial trial reveal a startling lack of proper training about the nature of trauma.The later formal accusation sends the unfortunate message that it is more damaging to potentially be thought of as a rapist than to have potentially been raped.

This insensitive and victim blaming mentality is unfortunately the norm, rather than the exception when it comes to student judicial boards. At Reed in 2010 and 2011, we dealt with a situation that highlighted the weaknesses of student-staffed Judicial boards in a way that is reminiscent of the shortcomings of the Honor Court at UNC-Chapel Hill. In 2011, one of our Judicial Board members felt she had no choice but to resign after being denied the right to serve on sexual assault cases. This denial was due to her perceived “emotional attachment” to the issue&#8211;i.e. her history of advocacy and engagement with issues of sexual assault on campus. After her resignation, many survivors came forward and told of the overwhelmingly unsatisfying and negative experiences they had with the Judicial Board at Reed. The survivors&#8217; stories highlighted the deeply misinformed nature of assumptions about rape and sexual assault that had been guiding the Judicial Board’s member’s handling of the cases. Similarly, we came to learn how woefully undertrained the board was when it came to being able to handle these issues. The stories from survivors sparked intense debate on campus, and ultimately played a role in the overwhelming student body support for a petition that called for institutional changes in the handling of sexual assault. As a result, Reed has now hired an assistant Dean for Sexual Assault Prevention and Handling, has a separate procedure for hearing cases pertaining to sexual assault in the Judicial Board, and has a volunteer student advocacy group for survivors. Additionally, sexual assault and consent are more frequently discussed outside of the context of the Judicial process.

Reed is by no means perfect, and there is still much work to be done when it comes to dismantling victim blaming and rape culture at large. By highlighting the shortcomings of college Honor Courts and Judical Boards, we hope to show that these cases are by no means isolated, and that they happen in college campuses across the country. Reed&#8217;s Feminist Student Union wrote this statement in an effort to remind survivors that they are not alone, and that they have the support of those who have seen the hurtful and traumatic potential of under-trained and ill-informed Honor Courts and Judicial Boards. By providing Reed’s responses to it’s own failings around sexual assault response and recovery, we hope to provide ideas, and open the dialogue for students and advocates at Chapel Hill.

In Solidarity,
  
Reed FSU
