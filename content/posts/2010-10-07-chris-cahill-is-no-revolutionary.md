My picture in the Quest’s last issue has sent a heavy load of painfully obstinate, deplorably sterile, and truly pungent RKSK fallout my way. In being forced into conversation with the Reed Institute’s lowest of the low, I am oft asked: Why does the Reed Revolutionary Youth Brigade (RRYB) supposedly “cower anonymously behind the ideals it puts fourth?” “Who are these brigands?” “Why were you there on the night of RKSK initiation?” “Clearly you must be involved, your photo is in the Quest!” To these statements, I would like to make the following clear:

Firstly I’d like to thank the Quest for my spread in their last issue. It did me justice. It did the American flag a favor. Secondly, I’d like to inform the student body that I have never directly laid eyes on any members of the RRYB! My involvement with the RRYB on the night of the RKSK initiation came strictly from the fact that I had been offered a sum of money in cash that I cannot legally disclose at the moment. In return for the cash amount I was required to bring my own personal PA system out onto the SU porch the night of RKSK Initiation and allow them use of my wireless microphone. In addition to the cash incentive I had also been promised entrance to an afterward masked-bacchanal with the founding members of the RRYB which, to my disappointment, was seemingly canceled.

I have no “position” within the seedy hierarchy of the RRYB. I was simply contracted by them as a sound technician. In order to avoid some sort of paper trail the plotting minds of the RRYB sought me out personally. My role on the night of the RKSK initiation is then comparable to that of the pianist, Nick Nightingale, in the Kubrick film, “Eyes Wide Shut.”

I was blindfolded at first when I handed the cunning youths of RRYB my microphone and again when it was returned to me. Despite my overwhelming desire to figure out who my employers were I was unable to identify them. For all I know, they may not even go here. They may even be sketchy alums.

Thank you.
