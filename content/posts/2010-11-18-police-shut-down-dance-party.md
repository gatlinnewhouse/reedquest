_Neighbor’s Noise Complaint Ends Reedies’ Fun_

The La Resistance dance party in the Student Union was shut down around midnight Friday Nov. 12 when a neighbor called the Portland Police after complaining to Reed, said Gary Granger, director of community safety. Daft Ball, the Daft Punk-themed party held the following night, however, did not disturb Reed’s neighbors.

“Somehow Saturday went by without a hitch. I don’t know what happened, but we got away without any complaints,” Granger said.

Portland’s noise ordinance allows complaints to be made any time after 10pm regardless of the day of the week, Granger said. “The law is written as such that if I feel like noise is disturbing me, my desire for quiet trumps any event that you might have,” he said.

While Reed has received numerous noise complaints in the past it has never been fined by the city, Kristin Holmberg, director of student activities, said. Under current policy, students will be asked to turn down music when a complaint is received. Community safety officers will request that the music be turned off if three complaints are received. If more than one neighbor calls in the same time span, they will all be counted as one complaint. After the music has been turned down, the next set of calls after the action will be considered the second noise complaint.

“Unfortunately we can’t control when the neighbors call the police,” Granger said. “We know we have at least one hypersensitive neighbor now.” The same woman has called Reed three times in the following week, including the night of Harvest Ball, Oct. 30, Granger said. Jennifer Bates speaks with neighbors about student events and attempts to address concerns before they arise.

The organizers of Renn Fayre tried to acquire a noise variance permit from the City of Portland two years ago, but the process involved a lot of work and was not worth it, Holmberg said. Neighbors had to be notified of the event with fliers.

“It was this nightmare process for really no benefit,” she said.
