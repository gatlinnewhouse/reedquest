Monday marked the official re-opening of the Reed pool! There may still be contractors completing some finish work, but many folks are doing laps under the new roof. After such a long closure requiring an enormous amount of patience and flexibility from the campus community, we want to express our great appreciation to our patrons for their understanding. Many of you put up with copious amounts of dust, noise, and other inconveniences — including changes to your routines, workout and relaxation plans, or your anticipated schedule of P.E. credits — while we all endured the challenges of construction. Finally, I would especially like to recognize the contractors and construction workers who put in the long hours to see this project through efficiently and safely.
