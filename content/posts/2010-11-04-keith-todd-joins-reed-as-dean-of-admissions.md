“How are your classes?” Keith Todd, dean of Admissions, asks me as he leads me into his office.

Despite the formal feel of his cherry-wood office the conversation retains the usual comfortable feel.

This comes as a warm surprise considering his impressive background. Starting as an admissions officer for Stanford, he moved east to become the director of admissions of Northwestern University then went south to direct the Admissions Office of Rice University. Exposure to varying campus settings and student populations, as well as his position as Executive Director of the Institutional International Education in Houston, has given Todd the ability to appreciate the importance of a population of students of diverse backgrounds.

In the past two months, Todd has visited Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo, Bangkok, Minneapolis and Washington D.C. (with a trip to Houston planned for next week) in an effort to draw students to Reed from diverse cultural backgrounds. The College hopes these new students will add to Reed’s increasingly diverse student population.

Todd’s dominant responsibility is to “attract, select, and enroll students with diverse backgrounds and interests through the use of publications and feedback from faculty,” in the tradition of remaining “honest and not marketing-driven.” Part of this responsibility includes seeking only those students from the nation’s graduating high school class who are suited to such a specific community as that of Reed College.

In accepting the position, he was “excited; Reed is not a place that is a wannabe. It is not thinking or following someone else’s model”. This is a statement that all students can vouch for, having received the subtle feel of the quirkiness surrounding Reed through the postcards and confetti-filled admissions envelopes.

In April, Todd “was invited to three seniors’ thesis orals despite being an administrator.” Todd emphasized the thesis experience at Reed as more than a graduation requirement. For this reason, the Admissions Office actively promotes the significance of the Senior Thesis to prospective students. “The orals were not a scary process. They are a joyful process. Seniors enjoyed the tough questions,” emphasizing the balance of hard work and “joy” characteristic of the Reed thesis experience,

The spirit of a Reedie, to him, is one of “intellectual vitality, someone who is not just smart but who looks for answers on her own; someone who pursues her own interests and own passions. [Reedies] have the energy and dynamism to learn.” Just as the thesis orals shaped his introduction to Reed’s campus culture, it has also formed his image of the student body. Todd believes that Reed is a unique institution due to the quirky and energetic character of  the student body.

Our interview concludes and Todd walks me into the lobby of the Admissions Office. As we say goodbye, he asks “It’s Ja-ni-tzki, not Janicki, right?”, pronouncing the “c” of my last name with an impressive, near-ideal soft Polish “c” sound. We begin a conversation on my Polish heritage, his German major, and other interests that continues beyond his office into the lobby of the Admissions Office.

Todd’s engaging manner was not bounded by an interview, and he had a genuine interest in connecting with me. This ability to engage should serve Todd well as he continues his tenure at Reed.
