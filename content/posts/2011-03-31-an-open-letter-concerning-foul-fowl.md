Apparently with the departure of Dax King came the departure of delicious &#8212; nay, edible! &#8212; chicken strips.

It was my own eggcitement that nearly overcame me as I walked through the doors of Commons in order to complete my daily quest for those freshly fried, four-stacked-high finger lickin’ delights. You can imagine, of course, my absolute horror to discover that what had become the flight of my life, the fire of my gastrointestinal tract, had just that day been replaced by such sad imposters as those shadily being dealt from behind the grill. So foul a day I had not seen!

Delicacies such as the original chicken strips are as rare as a hen’s teeth.

Therefore, I implore you: re-replace these new “chicken strips” with those old standards that I, and no doubt others, have come eggspect.

No poulty excuses will be accepted.

Firmly,
