Since the financial crisis, Americans have been constantly concerned with bad loans and borrowers who are unable to pay off their debts. According to Nisma Elias &#8217;12, this doesn&#8217;t just happen here.

Microfinance, a practice in which people in the developing world are given small loans to help them start businesses and earn an income, “has been hailed as an awesome way to get poor people out of poverty,” says Nisma, of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Nisma&#8217;s thesis, which she is working on with Denise Hare, will focus on microfinance in her home country. Bangladesh, the home of microfinance pioneer and Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has the highest penetration of microfinance institutions in the world, with 599 registered banks making small loans. “When I go back home,” says Nisma, “in every street there are at least three signs advertising microfinance organizations.” “We are the size of Iowa,” she registers. “That many institutions is just crazy.”

> “Double-dipping” borrowers cause rates to skyrocket, making microcredit less accessible and making the poor more indebted.

Along with the large number of small banks and old traditions like weekly instead of monthly payback of loans, there are other antiquated practices still in place in Bangladesh that Isma says “don&#8217;t make sense anymore.” One of these is the lack of any credit bureau that keeps track of the ability of banks and borrowers to repay debts. It has been observed in some countries that borrowers take out more than they can reasonably expect to pay off, and use it for non-investment purposes that will not bring back revenue. Borrowers also “double-dip,” using one loan to pay off another. In countries like Uganda and Bolivia, irresponsible microfinance borrowers caused rates to “skyrocket.” This made microcredit less accessible and the poor more indebted, Nisma said, “going against the whole solution that microfinance is supposed to represent.” In her thesis, Nisma investigates whether this phenomenon occurs in Bangladesh, and what can be done about it.

To determine whether this circumstance, which has not yet been proven to happen in Bangladesh, was indeed occurring in her home country, Nisma collected five years of data on the operations of three main microfinance institutions—including Grameen Bank, Yunus&#8217; own groundbreaking microcreditor—in 64 villages. She investigated how borrowers&#8217; interactions with one bank responded to changes in the activity of others, hypothesizing that at any given bank, repayment rates would decrease and the average level of debt per borrower would increase as other banks gave out more loans. This, Nisma reasoned, would happen as a result of poor Bangladeshis using microfinance as a “cushion for unexpected hardships,” taking multiple loans that they could not pay back at once from each of the banks she was studying. Each irresponsible microfinance customer would fail to pay back loans from not just one but two or three of the banks Nisma investigated, and would show up in the data for all the banks at once, pushing up their numbers together and resulting in the expected correlation. In the case of Grameen bank, Nisma did indeed find evidence that the more people were indebted to other banks, the more they owed Grameen as well. However, Nisma actually found the opposite effect in the case of one of the other banks, leaving her results somewhat ambiguous. Nonetheless, Nisma says she now feels she has a better understanding of microfinance in Bangladesh.

Nisma notes the importance of gaining such an understanding. She points to the case of an 18-year-old Indian girl who committed suicide over the burden and shame of a $3 loan she had taken for exam fees. She left a note reading: “Work hard and earn money. Don&#8217;t take loans.” However, at the same time, Nisma notes the potential microfinance has to help, and its potential to make a positive difference. She suggests that Bangladesh set up a credit bureau, which would give banks access to information about the records of borrowers, allowing the market for loans to avoid the conditions that push borrowers to dire levels of debt. “I think you just have to make organizations realize it&#8217;s to their benefit to make this work,” she notes, explaining that banks would benefit from knowing more about borrowers, but that “it only benefits one bank to share information if all the others share.” There are “a lot of complexities,” she says, but “it&#8217;s needed. I&#8217;m hoping maybe I can do something to help.”
