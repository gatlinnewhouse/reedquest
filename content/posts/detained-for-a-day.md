After leaving her grandmother’s house in Moscow on false pretenses, Reed student Sofya Shipova went to join the mass protests accompanying Russia Day and, within an hour of the start of the protest, found herself detained in the same police vehicle as opposition politician Ilya Yashin.

Russia Day, which occurs on June 12 each year, is celebrated with large festivities, including fireworks and fairs with people dressed in historical costumes. However, not all citizens view Russia Day as a holiday. This may be because the initial collapse of the Soviet Union caused drastic poverty and unemployment, or because younger citizens often do not see Russia under Putin’s government as something to celebrate. These protests were to get Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who was made a symbol of politician corruption, to answer to the accusations of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Inspired by the political moment, Shipova commented that she “came there as a patriot of my country, you know? To mobilize with others and show that we exist, those who want change, that we can be brought together and that we cannot be scared and that we can say what needs to be said, that our prime minister needs to answer for things he has done.”

Sofya Shipova was finishing posters for the protest the night before when Navalny changed the location from the previously approved Sakharov Avenue to Tverskaya Street. This last minute change in location made the demonstration illegal as it was not approved for the new setting near the main Russia Day festivities. The alteration was supposedly a response to the threat by Moscow city hall to not only not provide the necessary equipment for Navalny’s stage, but to kick any that did provide such out of Moscow entirely.

Shipova and her friend left by subway during the early afternoon on Monday just as the tweet showing the detention of opposition leader Alexei Navalny was posted by his wife. The two friends arrived to a chaotic scene of protesters intermingled with Russia Day celebrators in swarms of thousands. Policemen near prisoner transport vehicles were already eyeing the crowd when the protesters began to chant.

The crowd shouted various phrases, including “Putin—thief” and “Russia without Putin,” as well as the Russian national anthem. Protesters of all ages then began to quack, as the rubber duck is understood to be a symbol protesting Dmitry Medvedev’s duck house and other expensive—illegally obtained—properties. As the tension escalated, the police began to detain people in earnest.

The police force attempted to scare and disperse the protesters by cutting through the crowd in a line, the hands of one officer on the shoulders of the next. “\[They were\] pushing us and detaining people at random. Literally. Some people were just bystanders with flags of Russia. At one point as we were yelling ‘Shame!’ and paused, \[when\] one boy shouted it one more time. Those fuckers reacted instantly and almost jumped at him. My friend was pushed at the wall, but she is okay...They dragged the boy away. Like him, a lot of protesters were dragged away,” Shipova said.

As the protest continued, however, Shipova was taken away, nonviolently, by two officers. “People were yelling at the cops, exclaiming, ‘What are you doing?! She is a young girl!’” Shipova said. She was led into a police bus that held 21 other protesters, including Ilya Yashin, a Russian politician and opposition activist, and six underage individuals, at about 2:50 p.m. Moscow time. 

No one in the vehicle was informed as to what Article of the Russian Constitution they were detained for, and they had their passports taken away. Yashin gave the others tips, such as not to give their fingerprints since they were detained for an administrative offense and had the right to remain silent. They watched streams and news updates of the protests, while Yashin occasionally took calls from the liberal mass media.

Once at the intended detention center, the detainees were still not allowed outside of the vehicle. Two and a half hours later, all 22 people were still in the vehicle, and one man desperately had to urinate. Protesters begged police, but still the doors to the vehicle were locked. By Russian law, if policemen did not let him relieve himself immediately, their actions would be considered torture. The police finally complied after protesters threatened to file complaints to higher ranking officials, and the others were let out to smoke and breathe fresh air as well. After another hour of sedentary waiting, the authorities started to lead Shipova and others into the detention center in groups of five. Since all refused to give fingerprints, they were led back to the vehicle. Yashin contacted volunteers in order to provide the necessities that the police would not give the detainees.Yet another hour passed, at which point water first arrived, and later, food.

Police finally began to write protocols. All except Yashin were detained for Article 20.2 Part Five of the Russian Constitution, while Yashin was charged with Article 19.3. Article 20.2 Part 5 prohibits “violation by a participant in a public event of the established procedure for holding assemblies,” and Article 19.3 involves the resisting of police orders.

Around this time, a splitting pain overcame Shipova as a migraine, which she is quite prone to, hit. A detainee gave her pain pills, but she was still feeling sick and vomited when allowed outside of the vehicle. Yashin asked if she needed a hospital. “He also pleaded the cops inside the building to help me. They offered to call \[an\] ambulance, but I refused and asked if they had any \[migraine\] pills. \[They said\] ‘Who do you think we are? A pharmacy?!’ So I left back to breathe fresh air,” Shipova said.

As protocols were written, those involved were released, and the vehicle slowly began to empty. At 10:00 p.m., those remaining were allowed to sit inside the building. Shipova was the last person to be released besides Yashin, who was arrested for 15 days. Shipova was given her protocol for review. She claimed that the information describing disobedience was incorrect and filed the appropriate form for such. By then nearly midnight, Shipova “got out \[of\] the room and saw Ilya surrounded by the cops as he was sitting on the bench… Ilya thanked me for coming to the protest, I thanked him, and I left.” 

Shipova’s ride, two officers that were her family’s friends called by her grandmother, were waiting for her downstairs. Reflecting upon her actions, Shipova affirmed that, “The only thing that stops me from going to protests every day is that I have two more strikes in half a year, and then they do a criminal case against me. If you are detained, you can get detained three times in half a year, so I can’t risk it.”

Finally home, Shipova’s pro-Putin grandmother greeted her with condescending tears at the door. Shipova went to sleep, but the tension remained. “My grandma just believes everything on TV,” Shipova later said. “We did not talk to each other for a few days after it happened, and after that, \[we\] were arguing constantly. In the end, we stopped arguing, but we do not mention our political views to each other anymore.”

Shipova was accused of also breaking Article 19.3 Part 1 for “failure to follow a lawful order or demand of a police officer” a month later when she did not attend an invitation to fix her protocol. She skipped her court hearing on August 18 in order to avoid the possibility of getting detained for 15 days and missing her flight to the United States, and she will be out of the country for her court hearing on September 25.
