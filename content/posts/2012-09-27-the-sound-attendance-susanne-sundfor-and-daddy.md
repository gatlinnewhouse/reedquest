**NEW SINGLES**

**Susanne Sundfør:** _The Silicone Veil._ EMI Norway [SPACEY GLAM]

For Fans Of: Joanna Newsom, Lana Del Rey

I remember that the first time I listened to Lana Del Rey’s “Born to Die” I had a strange feeling that the song was made for me. It had taken the parts of pop that I think are legitimately dramatic and beautiful and breathed life into them. After listening to the lead single “White Foxes” by Norway’s Susanne Sundfør this week, I had a similar sensation only even more gratifying. Her voice soars over twerky synths like a satanic Dolly-Pardon. Even those who don’t like her sound can appreciate her vocal range, which in some ways has been rendered less important in recent years, but is still a delight to detect. I think it must be a new trend to release complete albums on YouTube to create buzz before the official release, because the entire _Silicone Veil_ LP is available for your consumption before its set October 8 release date. “Stop (Don’t Push the Button)” and “Rome” offer stripped-down glam that seems made for high-production music videos. And the controlled vengeance in her elongated vowels that come close to being shrill are a pleasure to behold no less.

**Daddy** (aka James Franco and Tim O’Keefe): _MotorCity._ [WISPY FUNK]

For Fans Of: James Franco and a bunch of other things

So far, only one track has been released off James Franco’s latest child-project Daddy, but it will be giddily received by all stalking his yo-yo career. The video for “Love in the Old Days” was produced by Franco and offers what _Rolling Stone_ is calling; “an Instagram kaleidoscope of frolicking summer girls.” It sounds more like the opening credits to a television show, which in all reality, might be its future course. It’s hard to judge one project of Franco’s career by its own merits with the knowledge of his other interests. His work becomes something to contextualize, to find traces of a similar style across various forms of media and graphic exercises. On its own, “Love in the Old Days” sounds cute and ponderous, but it becomes awkward to jam to when Franco starts singing about how he wants to fall in love just like his parents did. No doubt the album will be full of surprises, like a guest appearance of the legendary Smokey Robinson. And though there’s no guarantee that music will be a lasting fixture for Franco, or that the album will ever reach release, go ahead and frolic with Franco as you will.
