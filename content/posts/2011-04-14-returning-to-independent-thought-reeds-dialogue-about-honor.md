It saddens me that so many Reedies have fallen out of love with the Honor Principle. After hearing opinions at last week’s Reed Union, I think that our frustration stems from fundamental problems in the way we talk about Honor, rather than problems with the Honor Principle itself.

It does seem that the Honor Process needs to be seriously revised and reconsidered when it comes it sexual assault, but much of our dialogue and dissatisfaction about the Honor Principle stems from more petty issues.

AOD policy has been at the forefront of campus dialogue around the Honor Principle this year, both explicitly in _the Quest_ and casual conversations, and implicitly in anonymous signs attacking Gary Granger.

It is certainly true that one of the underlying tensions at the Union was AOD policy. Colin Diver, Mike Brody, and Tamara Metz were all careful to emphasize the importance and applicability to Reed of laws and rules that govern the broader community.

This rhetorical emphasis we now place on rules and policy, both in opposition to and affirmation of them, only serves to weaken the potential power of the Honor Principle and to feed our disenchantment.

The vagueness inherent in having a principle rather than a code is not a reason the Honor Principle cannot truly govern; it is instead the basis for its potential efficacy. The reason we are driven to attempts to codify, instead of embracing vagueness, is that the Honor Principle has been misused as a rhetorical tool.

By structuring our dialogue around questions of policy, by arguing about whether the Honor Principle does or does not oblige us to follow certain rules we are missing the point. By keeping the Honor Principle vague, but making a concerted effort to discuss and explore questions of honor, we can live up to the expectations of the Honor Principle and maximize its efficacy.

Laws, Honor Codes, and our Honor Principle are all essentially rhetorical devices intended to persuade people to good behavior; however you define “good.” None of them work perfectly. The unique power of the Honor Principle is that it embodies an imperative for inquiry rather than permitting freedom of inquiry.

To understand the Honor Principle’s potential we must begin to truly inquire, rather than allowing an emphasis on rules and policies to distort our conversation into mimicry of the conversations held in places with explicit governing codes.

It’s true that the college needs to operate as part of the broader community, and in that respect emphasis on rules is a helpful PR tool. But it is also true that we are privileged. Reed is insular, Reed is small, and Reed is selective. With the Honor Principle we have the opportunity to embrace that privilege and engage in an experiment in governance that places emphasis on the intellect rather than on structures of power.

When our dialogue is shaped by questions of policy we merely react. No matter what our position is, we are no longer required to attain intellectual depth. By framing our conversations solely in terms of the vague Honor Principle we have to be much more creative and we are forced to consider our actions much more deeply.
