Johannes Harkins, Alma Siulagi, Peter McTigue, and Kriya Krisnabai-Gitanjal are all excited, seemingly undaunted by the huge, yet enviable, task that faces them – in five month’s time, they’ll be putting on Reed’s Biggest Party of the Year. They are this year’s Renn Fayre Czars.

While the job is undoubtedly huge, they seem to be approaching it methodically, treating each component as a unique and vital part of a greater whole. Since Renn Fayre is ultimately powered by individuals, the Czars are making sure that every part of the party gives Reedies a unique way to add to the spirit of the Fayre.

“Student involvement and the fact that it’s a volunteer event is a big part of it for me,” says Czar Harkins of his approach to the event. He added that this volunteerism-based approach “encourages everyone to get involved in his or her own way,” making Renn Fayre more inclusive than would otherwise be possible. Czar McTigue added that this approach is uniquely suited to take advantage of the Renn Fayre atmosphere, in which “Reedies leave the library/dorm rooms/balconies/seemingly exclusive gatherings and at least attempt to interact with each other,” and “cynicism is at a yearly low.”

This means that a major focus of this year’s team is on Renn Fayre projects, and the various people who band together to undertake them. Harkins says that he wants the Czars to make student projects a priority. However, he says that one problem with projects is their unfortunate tendency to fizzle out before fruition.

“Sometimes it’s hard to get people to follow though on projects and they end up falling flat. I want to see a few big projects that do really well and a lot of people can enjoy,” Harkins said of the difficulty. Conventional Renn Fayre wisdom dictates that much of people’s ability to maintain group cohesion around these larger projects will ultimately have to do with how good of a theme the Czars come up with. For instance, last year’s excellently executed birth canal bridge bore strong and obvious ties to the Genesis theme, and these Czars hope that similarly strong projects will emerge from their theme.

“Themes are the fun part,” said Harkins. Despite the fun, however, there remain difficulties in the process. The biggest of these troubles involves coming up with a theme that is definite, yet gives people room for interpretation.

He elaborated at length on this tenuous balance, saying, “A bad theme idea is one that doesn’t leave any room for interpretation. Part of the reason Genesis was such a good theme was because it had a lot of room for interpretation. It went a million different ways and it looked really cool. Bad theme ideas are themes that shut people out and prevent them from doing something really cool because it doesn’t fit.”

The czars hope that when the Renn Fayre theme is revealed at Madonna Ball in the spring it will reflect this paradigm. Until then, Reedies can only hope that this year’s Renn Fayre will be, in the words of Czar McTigue, “a Huge Party”
