_Daniel Lybrand is Signator of Reed&#8217;s chapter of United Students Against Sweatshops._

Do you know who manufactures your clothing? Do you care?

It&#8217;s time you were introduced to Reed College&#8217;s chapter of United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS). We are interested in improving working conditions for garment manufacturers worldwide. You might ask, &#8220;Why are college students taking it upon themselves to make change thousands of miles away? Isn&#8217;t that somebody else&#8217;s job?&#8221; Well, maybe it should be, but nobody else does it. As it happens, college and university students have an incredible amount of power over the conditions in the factories that manufacture clothing for companies like Nike and Adidas.

Recently, Nike, Adidas, and other clothing companies have refused to compensate workers at the Indonesian factory PT Kizone, a manufacturer of garments for these brands, for $1.8 million in back-wages that they are still owed after the factory was suddenly shut down several months ago.

Former factory workers are naturally the best at explaining their plight: A machine operator identifying himself as Budi said, “the products that we made are being used, and selling well, in the international market, in America, and other countries, outside Indonesia. We feel sad. Why? Because the Kizone workers were left bankrupt, the owner disappeared, and we see the products we made &#8211; the people who made them now aren&#8217;t working, and are abandoned.”

Contracts to manufacture college apparel are worth millions of dollars annually to the garment industry and the target consumers for college apparel just so happen to be college students. That means we have the power to decide which brands of clothing we will accept in our college bookstores.

In order to effectively determine which companies in the garment industry are mistreating workers, USAS works together with the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), an independent monitoring organization. The WRC collects complaints of abuse from factory workers, as well as information provided by industry representatives, and performs spot checks of factories suspected to be in violation of worker&#8217;s rights. WRC reports on worker rights violations are released to the public.

The WRC&#8217;s governing board is comprised of five USAS representatives, five administrators from participating colleges and universities, and five representatives of the WRC Advisory Council, a body comprised of labor rights experts and representatives of worker-allied organizations. It provides information about violations to member colleges and universities. These institutions are thus able to cut contracts with offending companies, applying direct economic pressure on manufacturers to abide by international labor law.

The Reed College chapter of USAS would like to see our institution affiliated with the WRC, but to do so, we need the approval of as many students, faculty, staff and administrators as possible. If you have any interest in furthering this cause, please e-mail me at &#x64;&#x6c;&#x79;&#x62;&#x72;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x64;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75; or attend the weekly meetings, Tuesday at 7:30 pm in the Blue Heron Infoshop (GCC basement). There will also be a special meeting tonight (Thursday October 13<sup>th</sup>) at 8:00 pm._ _
