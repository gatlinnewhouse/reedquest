1. Tall dude working in Paradox around 4. Akira shirt. Super cute. I liked ur smile. My lips have been vacant for 2 long. Get at me on facebook <3

2. You didn’t believe me when I said the steam tunnels existed&#8211;meet
  
me in Sallyport two Sundays from now and we’ll see what gets steamy.

3. Heard your backpack buzz
  
TOTALLY wasn’t your phone!
  
Can I help you out?

You: frantically silencing in the 2nd floor southeast stacks.
  
Me: better than plastic

4. You: a little rough around the edges, yet possessed of a certain
  
elegance and the ability to make delightful sounds when I work you just
  
right. Sleek, multitalented, and always willing, you were a staple in my
  
life.
  
Me: desperately missing my only frying pan after Noise Parade.

5. You: The luscious blonde on the Commons patio with the chicken quesadilla, Marlboro light, and beautiful, perfect, round, perky breasts.
  
Me: The only gay man you’ll ever need. BE MY FAG HAG.

6. You: Badass femme physics major.
  
Me: Scatterbrained, scarf-wearing HSS major.
  
We swore we’d see each other, but got swallowed in the first week of work. Tea furrealz?
