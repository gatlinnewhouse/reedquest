**Is chivalry dead?**
  
For the most part, and good riddance.

**The Reedie hipster: nature or nurture?**
  
Clearly nurture. The freshmen would never start wearing skinny jeans and growing mullets if they didn’t have Todd and Luca to look up to.

**Team Edward or Team Jacob?**
  
NOT EVEN ONCE.
  
**
  
Three words to describe your ideal mate:**
  
Did you really use the word ‘mate,’
  
En-szu? I don’t want a ‘mate.’

**This year’s batch of freshmen — hot or not?**
  
Slightly singed, but certainly not on fire. They need to be aged.
  
**
  
Favorite Commons dish:**
  
Whatever you’ll buy me.

**Favorite dessert:**
  
Lemon bars.

**Immorality Quotient as a freshman vs. IQ as a senior?**
  
Oh goodness, I fear mine’s only jumped 200 points.
  
**
  
The tramp stamp — sexy or skanky?**
  
Skanky as hell.
  
**
  
What’s the craziest thing you’ve done to get the attention of someone you found attractive?**
  
I’m pretty conventional. Usually I just make eyes and sigh a lot.
  
**
  
Benefriends — does it work?**
  
Depends on your definition of ‘work.’ I’m game
