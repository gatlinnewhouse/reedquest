Reed College will be hosting the country’s first Tango Music Institute this summer from June 23 &#8211; 30. The intensive music camp is designed to teach fifty proficient musicians to perform using the unique tango performance practice technique on their personal instrument.

The Tango Institute is an inaugural event not only for Reed College, but also in the history of tango music. Pablo Aslan, Grammy Award-Winning violinist and lead instructor of the Institute, says, “This is a very exciting time. I think it&#8217;s the beginning of tango pedagogy in the US. We are sensing a lot of interest in this, and we hope that we can provide a week of total immersion so that the attendees feel that this was a breakthrough experience.” The only event of its kind in the United States as of now, it has received national and international interest.

“There are a lot of elements that go into learning this musical tradition,” says Aslan. “Not the least of which are the oral, in person aspects, and what you learn from doing and playing with more experienced musicians.” Apart from Aslan, violinist Christine Brebes, pianist Octavio Brunetti, and bandoneon player Julian Hasse will travel from Argentina to teach at the institute.

Throughout the week-long workshop there will be a series of sectional rehearsals, master classes for specific instruments, lectures on tango history, ensemble rehearsals, and fun activities in the evening, ranging from jam sessions to tango dances in downtown Portland. At the end of the week, there will be a concert open to the public featuring the guest artists along with the camp participants, and afterwards, a tango dance party will be held in the Student Union.

Morgan Luker, Assistant Professor of Music, has been preparing for the Tango Music Institute with Pablo Aslan and the Conference and Events Planning Office since November 2011. Although the camp is not designed specifically for Reed students, Luker encourages Reedies to attend or otherwise participate. “There will be volunteer opportunities if students want to be involved,” says Luker. “If you want to volunteer, that could be a reduced tuition…all that can be worked out. It will be exciting just to be around these people if you’re interested in tango, if you’re interested in music, it’s a really great opportunity.”

Luker also says the camp allows for an international experience without the challenges that come with international travel. “At Reed, we can’t all get off of campus and go abroad…but I think that bringing international artists here, and to have the chance for people to interact with them, intensively is a great thing to be doing. That’s why I would love students to participate, and they should absolutely get in touch with me if they even an inkling of wanting to be involved.”

Academic Special Events Coordinator Brittney Corrigan-McElroy, who worked with Luker to plan the event, says, “This particular conference will bring a large variety of people onto our campus&#8230;.Supporting such a unique and diverse conference is an excellent opportunity for Reed to highlight the talents of our faculty, showcase our support of the arts, and connect to the larger community locally, nationally, and internationally.”
