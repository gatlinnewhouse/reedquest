Two weeks away from fall break, as the summer weather dims and the leaves prepare to change colors, the Reed College Peer Health Advocates are putting their first month’s work on the shelf and preparing to embark on another project. After wrapping up Sextember with HIV Testing Day on Friday, Sept. 28, the PHAs ended a month of events that included a sexual health jeopardy week through the dorms.

In our first year after a change of regime, the PHAs have a new focus: connecting Reedies with what Reedies need. Previously, the PHAs were known for giving tips on working out or finding “fitness buddies” for fellow students; now the focus is more general, and hopefully more effective. The goal this year is to simply make Reedies more aware of all the factors of maintaining healthy lifestyles: sexually, physically, and mentally. The PHAs are not here to be physical trainers or lecturers; we are here to connect our peers with the resources the campus already has. Even though we have numerous PE classes, nurses, counselors, etc., it takes a second effort to remind people of how easy they are to access and how much they can help. We hope to build a presence this year on campus and collaborate with other groups to pull your minds away from stress, promote healthy sexual relationships, and stay active. Our next theme will be the “Fall Harvest,” in which we will organize events focused on nutrition, and hopefully provide Reedies with something I always enjoy: dank food.
