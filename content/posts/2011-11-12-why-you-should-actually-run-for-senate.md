When I tell people that they should run for Senate, the most common reaction I get is a blank stare or look of disgust and a reply about how boring I sound. Fair enough, but I stand by my statement. Reed’s Student Senate has a history of being exclusive, semi-corrupt, and pretty inefficient, but this hasn’t been the case in recent years. As Senate has become more of a representative body, and attempted to be more transparent, we have also made substantive changes that actually affect the student body. Just last week we passed a document that changes the way sexual assault cases are handled and adjudicated. But Senate still could be more representative and diverse – which is where you come in.

If you’ve ever been unhappy about SOMETHING at Reed, you should run for Senate. If you’ve ever wanted something to be DIFFERENT at Reed, you should run for Senate. It can be something totally mundane or something huge. If you want a fancy water fountain in the library, or if you want Reed to have a gender studies program, you should run for Senate and make it happen.

A lot of people stay away from Senate because they don’t know much about it, so let me debunk some myths for you.

  * It’s not a volunteer position – you get $140 a month! (And every student pays $130 a semester in Student Body Fees, so it’s a pretty good deal.)
  * It seems like Senate is just committee reports and passing minutes, but it’s not! It’s usually a stretch of quiet activity followed by a few weeks of intense conversation and work on something that a chunk of the student body really cares about.
  * It’s really not that much work, especially in the stretches of quiet activity. Senators have three regular meetings a week – executive session, Senate meetings, and either Appointments or Finance Committee. Those meetings rarely last more than an hour each, so it really just equates to cutting down your _Breaking Bad_ obsession by three episodes a week.
  * You get to interact with administrators and trustees (not to mention a fancy dinner with Colin).
  * You have a say in the everyday life of Reed students, whether it’s appointing Renn Fayre Czars or approving $700 of chicken wings.

Since this list has obviously convinced you to run, your next step is to pick up a petition (in the library lobby, Commons, and the Paradox), get 25 signatures, get elected, and CHANGE THE WORLD (or get us a new water fountain).
