Greenboard said it received one hundred forty-six signatures in support of the resolution and encountered only one staunch opponent of the measure.

However, the resolution only “strongly discourage[s] the use of Reed College funds to purchase single-serving bottles of water.” Senator Shabab Mirza ’13 said at the March 15 Senate Meeting that visiting performers often request bottled water and voiced concerns that banning the purchase of bottled water with Student Body Funds might make it difficult to bring performers to campus. Senator John Iselin ’14 emphasized in an interview that the purchase of bottled water with Student Body Funds was only “strongly discourage[d],” and that exceptions would be made for visiting performers who request bottled water.

Iselin said that while Senate only has direct control over water purchased with Student Body Funds, passing the resolution was intended to prod the administration into making the next move. Greenboard’s stated goal is to “systematically find everywhere bottled water is purchased by the school and get rid of it.”

Take Back the Tap, a campaign organized by the Washington D.C.-based non-profit Food & Water Watch, has spread to colleges nationwide. Over ninety schools across the country, including Brown, Harvard, and Dartmouth, have banned or restricted the sale of bottled water on their campuses. Currently, bottled water is sold at Homer’s Hut and in vending machines across Reed campus.

Senator Marie Perez ’12 raised concerns that “When you prohibit something, you eliminate the choice. In that choice there’s moral, private reward in the appropriate choice or the ethical choice.” Greenboard said that they did not intend to persecute those who drank bottled water and wanted to ban its sale primarily as a statement against the commoditization of water.

Treasurer Paul Messick ’15 asked why Greenboard was limiting their campaign to bottled water and not also seeking to ban other products sold by companies that commoditize water. Greenboard called the resolution a “a practical symbolic thing.” Senate Publicity Officer Michael Zhao ’14 asked where bottled water is sold on campus and whether sparkling water would be banned under the new resolution.

Greenboard said that sparkling water was not a target because there is not the alternative of getting it from the tap.

Zhao raised concerns that students might feel blindsided, but offered a potential solution.

“Maybe we could set up a Water Nation,” he said.
