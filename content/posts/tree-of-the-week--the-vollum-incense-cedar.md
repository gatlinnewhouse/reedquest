In 1933, 22 years after the college held its earliest classes, Reed’s personnel planted the very first of our campus’s many trees. Among these early individuals were five Incense Cedars, _Calocedrus decurrens_, all of which survive to this day. Notable for its sweet smell, scaly foliage, and flaky, furrowed bark, _Calocedrus decurrens_, in spite of its name, is not actually a true cedar, but is still the most common wood in the construction of “cedar” chests (as well as pencils). This hardy, fire-resistant tree ranges from Mount Hood to Baja California and can live to be 500 years old. This week’s featured Incense Cedar stands to the side of the walkway between Vollum and the library, and is likely around 85 years old, still very young by this species’s considerable standards.
