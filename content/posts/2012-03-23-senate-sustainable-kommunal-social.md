If a Senate meets every Thursday at 5 PM in the SU, and no one is there to attend it, is progress still made? In the words of one of the greatest political thinkers of our generation, “you betcha!” Since day one, Senate has been hard at work promoting sustainability both on and off campus, fostering community dialogue, and reforming our bureaucracy one bylaw and appointment at a time. There’s a lot more of course, but lists with more than three items read poorly. There’s a lot to be said about how much Senate has done and will do in the future, but frankly, the results speak for themselves.

Just the other week, Senate, working with members of Greenboard, passed a motion banning the sale of bottled water on campus. This coincides perfectly with Senator Dana Loutey’s initiative to put more water bottle-friendly water fountains in the library. But this is just one step in a broader plan to restore our college’s commitment to sustainability and the environment. Senator Marie Perez has been leading the charge on this front, pushing for programs that not only improve our carbon footprint going forward, but also help mitigate past environmental damage. For example, in an effort to reduce the possibly harmful effects of lead bullets on the environment, Senate has reached an agreement with RSSC to donate a portion of its co-payments (as well as matching funds from the Student Body) towards conservation efforts in the Tualatin River area. You might also be pleased to hear that the newest couches for the SU porch will be built by Reedies out of trees that fell naturally on campus. It literally does not get more local that this. Unless you count making sculptures out of your own belly button lint which only you can look at in your own room. But no one does that&#8230;

Sustainability is great and all, but the most important function of a representative government is to make sure the interests of its constituents are heard. Thanks to Senate, the administration hears us loud and clear. Whether it’s organizing a town hall meeting on the recent arrests involving AOD policy implementation, or halting implementation of the SPO program until we as a community can agree on what role they should play in protecting campus, Senate has been working hard to ensure that there is plenty of room for productive dialogue whenever a misunderstanding arises and you can expect it to continue doing so in the future.

Beyond sustainability and discussion however, there is a whole world of everyday bureaucratic procedures which Senate has been handling like the champs they are. Finance committee has approved thousands of dollars of funding for various student-run events and clubs such as kommunal umbrellas, whiffle ball cookouts, and oh yeah, RENN FAYRE! Meanwhile, in addition to undergoing a massive overhaul of procedures and bylaws, Appointments Committee has been filling positions left and right with qualified student candidates. As a side note, please apply for things. They’re good for your resumé and sometimes involve getting paid. Speaking of getting paid, Student Body wage review committee is continuing on with its mission to ensure fair and just compensation among all workers receiving Student Body-funded paychecks. So make sure you fill out your wage review surveys, unless you really hate getting the money you deserve.

Moving forward, you can expect Senate to keep representing your best interests. But in order for it to do so, you’ve got to make yourselves heard. If you think sustainability is important, let us know. If you have an idea for how SPOs should handle AOD situations, we are all ears. If you think Commons should stop charging for carbonated water, join the club, or better yet, signate it and get funding through finance committee. If you or anyone you know has a complaint worth addressing, note that Senate can only address the problems it is aware of. For that, we need your help. I urge you to come speak your mind at a Senate meeting, or during office hours (look in SB-info or the soon to be updated Senate bulletin board in the GCC), or email ([&#x73;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x74;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1]), or just use Twitter or Facebook. That’s right, Senate is going social.

If you have Twitter, follow us [@SenateReed][2] where you can look forward to livetweetings of Senate meetings, quick announcements, and general hashtag tomfoolery. (It should be noted that @ReedSenate has gone rogue and no longer has any association with the Reed College Student Senate.) Otherwise, [find us on Facebook][3]. Both are great ways to learn what’s going on around Senate and to let us know what you’re thinking, even if you can’t make it to meetings. Also worth noting, we’re currently having a contest on our Facebook Page; once we reach 120 fans, one lucky Reedie will get a $5 gift card to the Paradox. If this goes well, you can look forward to future contests with bigger prizes. If it fails, Marie will kill a baby rabbit and post a gif of it.
