As part of a larger sustainability effort that has included an energy-savings contract and a curbside composting initiative, Reed College students have performed “trash autopsies” to help assess the waste habits of campus community members. The autopsies consist of investigators looking through trash cans to catalogue the types of waste being thrown away. The particular focus of these autopsies is on recycling: The investigators intend to discern how much recyclable material is being thrown away in the trash and recycling bins.

One of the students performing the autopsies is Talia Tiffany, a senior involved with Reed’s Environmental Health and Safety department (EHS). Beginning at the start of the 2012 spring semester, Tiffany was involved in the process of performing trash autopsies to create better signage for campus recycling cans. Somewhere in the middle of the semester she created signs that visually represented the types of waste acceptable for recycling. This semester she has worked on revising the signs to better reflect the habits of Reed community members. Trash autopsies have also been performed by students sometime around “five or six years ago,” according to Townsend Angell, director of facilities operations.

One of the goals of the trash autopsies is the reduction of trash contamination of recycling. The placing of non-recyclable material causes the whole load to be thrown into the trash, because the city does not have the resources to sort through entire loads. Tiffany notes that some physical plant workers have sometimes sorted through trash in an effort to remove non-recyclable material, but she adds that such actions fall outside of their responsibilities and violate health codes.

The autopsies revealed several things about waste habits on campus. One thing that was found was that people often ignore recycling signage, treat plastic and glass the same, and mistakenly believe that coffee cups are recyclable and that “it’s always better to recycle if you aren’t sure”. Tiffany recommends that community members read recycling signage, and that they be aware that not all plastics are recyclable, plastic and glass should not be treated the same, trash contamination of recycling loads should be heavily avoided, and that paper coffee cups are not recyclable. (They are coated in a wax that cannot be recycled with paper.)

The autopsies help create a better understanding of the situation for EHS so that they can spread awareness of proper recycling techniques. Angell also hopes to get the trash autopsies “institutionalized,” to perhaps collect year-to-year data on the composition of trash material.

Angell characterizes the trash autopsies as being part of a wider sustainability effort on campus. He compares it to the curbside composting program currently being tested in the apartments, co-ops, and Reed apartments. Angell says that any costs incurred by the composting program are offset by its social benefits.

“There’s a social cost beyond the dollars and cents,” says Angell.

Tiffany also views the autopsies in a larger context. She wants to see Reedies more engaged with environmental issues than they currently are. She says that because of Reed’s profile as a liberal-arts institution in an environmentally progressive city, there is often a “tacit assumption” that the school is heavily environmentally involved, when in actuality it is “a lot farther behind” other institutions.

Tiffany partly blames the character of the student body: She says that students often have “intense drives to do certain things,” which she sees as both an asset and a “hindrance.” She hopes to harness energy between students and Physical Plant, as the effort for sustainability necessarily “has to be a collective endeavor.”
