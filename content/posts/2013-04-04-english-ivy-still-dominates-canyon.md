The Reed Canyon is suffering from an ivy infestation. Not long ago, “every tree in the Canyon used to have ivy to the top of it,” Zac Perry, head of the Canyon Restoration Project says. English ivy was allowed to propagate largely undisturbed for 80 to 100 years, and the Canyon became infested and required machetes to navigate. Left unchecked, the largest ivy roots had grown to 18 inches in diameter, and smaller plants covered much of the 30-acre forest floor. Canyon restoration days had been held once a year for almost a century, but the ivy population was hardly dented.

“I get really angry when I see people cultivating gardens of ivy,” Junior Canyon Crew member Rachel Pincus says.

According to Perry, the vines have an ability “to smother out–kill–trees and shrubs.” Deposited in the canyon by passing birds or existing plants, English ivy quickly grows outward, smothering native ferns and berry bushes. Once the plant reaches adulthood, the vines begin to climb up trees, eventually encircling the entire trunk and all the branches in a thick mesh of waxy-green leaves. Not only do the ivy leaves prevent sunlight from reaching the tree leaves, the ivy leaves weigh down the branches and act like giant sails during windstorms. The native trees, weakened by lack of sunlight and burdened by the combined weight of the vines, are brought down by the gusts. This is the reality that many of Oregon’s urban forests face when a single ivy plant grows to become all-encompassing.

Initial weed removal began in 2000 with the start of the Canyon Restoration Project. Ever since, the Canyon Crew and volunteers have continued to “pick away” at the remaining plants. Workers initially chopped the ivy roots at the bases of trees, killing the vines that had grown onto the branches. But the work was far from over.

English ivy is notoriously difficult to eradicate. Its waxy leaves make the plant resistant to herbicide applications and drought. In addition, once the roots are pulled up and the vines cut, in order to prevent “root initials” from sprouting and taking root, an extra step is required. The process of solarizing the plants involves isolating the vines from water until they dry out completely. About eradicating the ivy, Perry said they made “better results if we impact the ivy in the fall.” He added, “persistence pays,” as each year the volunteers and Canyon Crew weaken the roots system of the ivy. The homes around Reed can also help by removing English ivy from their yards.

Ten years ago, it was possible to walk into an Oregon nursery and purchase a _Hedera helix_ plant for use as groundcover in landscaping. Today, English ivy is banned for sale to the public. Originally brought from Europe as an erosion-controlling groundcover, the noxious weed is now one of the most destructive, invasive threats facing forests in the Pacific Northwest.
