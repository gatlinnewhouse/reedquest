The following editorial is not as cynical as it first appears. Bear with us.

Elections Assembly this evening may have been an eye-opening introduction to Reed politics for the newer students in attendance. But upperclassmen saw it fit into a similar pattern to previous assemblies: First-time senatorial candidates take the podium with fire in their
  
hearts and declare their principles. Platforms rest on vague visions of student involvement and autonomy, hopes to increase campus dialogue and involvement, and tenuous factual claims about particular issues and solutions. Candidates have low attendance records at Senate meetings and they show wide variance in their understandings of bylaws, committees, and procedure (though Senate candidate Maya Frodeman had a graceful response to the classic but often-unexpectde &#8220;favorite bylaw&#8221; question: &#8220;My favorite bylaw is the abstract bylaw of the Honor Principle&#8221;).

It&#8217;s good when Assembly attendees hold them accountable—good, hard questions were asked tonight by sitting Senators and civilian Reedies alike. But it should be kept in mind: Awareness on issues and practicality of platforms should not be a primary concern when deciding between a field of first-time senatorial candidates. While necessary for a Senator, these qualities do not necessarily predict which candidate can best serve the duties of that position.

Consider the presidential and vice-presidential candidates: It was clear that they have more experience and specific knowledge of Reed politics than the all-first-time crop of Senate candidates. But they had a first time running for Senate too. This editorial board was around for those first elections and the first elections of most current senators, and it can testify that they came in with the same fire in their hearts that we saw tonight—and the same loose grip on how that fire could become a guiding light for the community. But from year to year, election to election, they followed an observable trajectory from that passionate if underinformed candidate to better informed, more effective candidates. Now, they speak the language of Reed politics, and not in a bad way. Their success and failure as Senators was determined not by their firm grasp on the issues as candidates, but as their willingness and ability to learn, adapt, and grow when faced with a governmental system that was not what they first expected. This requires not specific knowledge but a flexible intelligence, an ability to get along with coworkers, and a well-checked ego.

The same will be true of the current batch of candidates. It&#8217;s okay that many of tonight&#8217;s policy proposals were somewhat untenable, many of the ideals vague. What matters in a candidate is not how good of a Senator they would make today, the propensity they show to grow into a good Senator after learning the way things work. So vote for the candidate you think can understand and adapt to a new system that they maybe weren&#8217;t expecting. And don&#8217;t give up hope: The Senators of today, who not so long ago were running for their first times, will pass knowledge down to the newcomers, and Senate will uphold its traditions as it always has.
