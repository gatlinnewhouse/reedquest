Her face covered in a black hood, a woman in military fatigues speaks at the urging of the devil at her side. As she tells us the set description of Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, light tosses the image of a dead woman on dual screens built into the set. She is played by the same actress as the hooded figure, and killed herself onscreen only minutes before; she will do so again on stage before the night is through. As she bleeds three masked figures stuff what look to be dollar bills into her mouth.

This is but one moment in _Horror or Her Mirror_, a thesis play directed by senior Rosalie Lowe and written by alumnus Jesse Van Buren, featuring a thesis performance by Ariana Karp. It only becomes more arcane and intense as the performance progresses.

The production is a maelstrom of magnificently disturbing aesthetics and acting that seems to shudder violently under the weight of a labyrinthine script. Based on Hedda Gabler, the piece structurally corresponds to the Stations of the Cross and the Hebraic arcana; the title of each scene is thrown onto the projection screens. A puppet show divides the two acts. If there is a plot to speak of, it seems to involve twisted representations of Ibsen’s characters interacting with Lynndie England, one of the military personnel convicted for torture at Abu Ghraib and on trial here for giving birth to monsters. Past that, I am not sure what happens.

_Horror’s_ characters move about the stage gesticulating wildly, punctuating their phrases with feral yips and tics. The body language of Aunt Julle, played by Alex Tatarsky, is most pronounced. She moves as a rigid doll across the stage, peppering comments at the other characters with a voice that undulates across several registers. Jurgen Tesman, played by Dominic Finocchiaro, transforms regularly into the troll, and at one point goes swimming through a pile of books overturned on stage. They regularly talk, shout, and scream over one another, at several points filling the stage with a vulgar cacophony that lasts for minutes.

The only ones not afflicted by this melodramatic fever are Lynndie England and Hedda Gabler, both played by Karp. She commands the stage by virtue of her stillness. Both roles are mastered: a square posture and drawl distinguish her clearly from the bourgeois Hedda that converses with her throughout the play by virtue of film. Karp gives a powerful performance, conveying her incredible isolation in every phrase and gesture.

Beautifully crafted by Tevon Edwards and David Lansdowne, the set magnifies the grime and desolation of the production. Twin walls painted a grim shade of greenish gray flank two projection screens and a platform touched on either end by stairs. It stands above a great furnace from which a deep red light and several characters emerge. Center stage is strewn with flowers that, in the half-light of the opening scene, appear as the remains of some dismembered corpse. Lighting by Zach Horvath, sound by Ross Young, and original music composed by alumni Luke Baltzell and John Kenagy further distort this strange theatrical world.

In the end, _Horror_ is an experience whose success depends on ability of the audience to lose its hold on those conventions of plot and form that simplify the digestion of art. It demands a high price of entry, leaving the viewer both befuddled and certain that something dreadful has happened. If there is any meaning to this madness it lies hidden in the interstices of numberless stories stitched together on stage.
