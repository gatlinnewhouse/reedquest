excerpt: Behind an innocuous door on the top floor of the Biology building is a state-of-the-art, 1,000 square foot, climate-controlled greenhouse. The greenhouse is warm and humid, with sliding tables on which small plants are beginning to grow, and orange lights illuminate the rooms day and night. Biology Professor David Dalton has been working at Reed since 1987 and has born witness to many of the changes to the greenhouse over the years. He says the greenhouse was originally just a “south-facing room” with cement benches that was built along with the Biology building in the 1950’s. The structure stayed the same until more additions were made in 1990. In 2001, with the renovation of the Biology building came a further expansion of the greenhouse and the “state-of-the-art” setup students enjoy today. The greenhouse now has four main rooms, and the lighting, temperature, and cooling are all controlled by a central computer.

Behind an innocuous door on the top floor of the Biology building is a state-of-the-art, 1,000 square foot, climate-controlled greenhouse. The greenhouse is warm and humid, with sliding tables on which small plants are beginning to grow, and orange lights illuminate the rooms day and night. Biology Professor David Dalton has been working at Reed since 1987 and has born witness to many of the changes to the greenhouse over the years. He says the greenhouse was originally just a “south-facing room” with cement benches that was built along with the Biology building in the 1950’s. The structure stayed the same until more additions were made in 1990. In 2001, with the renovation of the Biology building came a further expansion of the greenhouse and the “state-of-the-art” setup students enjoy today. The greenhouse now has four main rooms, and the lighting, temperature, and cooling are all controlled by a central computer.

Reed researchers use the unique conditions to grow plants not native to Oregon and control environmental variables. “It allows us to cultivate plants out of season,” Professor Keith Karoly says. Karoly uses the greenhouse for researching the evolution of flower color difference. Working at Reed since 1994, Karoly now teaches Vascular Plant Diversity and Intro Biology, but spends much of his time researching flowering mustard plants in the greenhouse. Along with the other plants, the yellow mustard flowers grow in black plastic planters on long rectangular tables. Cramped walkways and shelves take up the remaining space in the glass rooms.

Dalton himself teaches Intro Biology and Plant Physiology and the latter involves plants grown in the greenhouse. He works with soybeans and cycads as both plants have interesting nitrogen-fixing properties. Dalton calls cycads “living fossil plants” as they’ve been around for millions of years and were “what the dinosaurs ate.” On the roots of the cycads are cyanobacteria that live symbiotically with the cycads and help to fix nitrogen into the soil. David is working to examine the diversity of the bacteria as well as physiological aspects of nitrogen fixation. He says that typically four to five students a year have theses that involve greenhouse research.

Lauren Carley ’12, Ian McCahill ’13, and Dalton have embarked on one of the larger research projects that involves genetically-modified poplar trees. In collaboration with the forestry department at Oregon State, Reed has acquired dozens of genetically engineered poplars that are designed to produce extra vitamin C than wild poplars. In theory, the GM poplars should have higher stress tolerances for heat and drought, however, when looking through the trees it appeared that the normal poplars were healthier than the experimental ones. Dalton says that parasites and other pests are not usually a problem, but there have been large spider-mite infestations in the past. For one experiment involving the effects of atmospheric environments of plant development, students ran tubing through the greenhouse to pump gas into the rooms.

Dalton says that the most interesting aspect of the greenhouse is the state-of-the-art technology. “It also makes an orange glow at night.”
