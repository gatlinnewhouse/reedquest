After over a year of vacancy, Gary Granger joined the Reed community in July as the new Director of Community Safety. Though not a Reedie himself, Granger already seems to have a handle on the rigorous, if not slightly silly, atmosphere here. He comes to Reed from his position as the Director of Public Safety and Transportation & Parking at OHSU where he once published an entire week&#8217;s security blotter in limericks for National Poetry Month.

Originally from Riverside, CA, Granger has lived in the Portland area wit his wife and two daughters since 1997. &#8220;Reading through the website and doing some research&#8230; I was struck by the paradoxes of Reed,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There&#8217;s something about it that resonates with me personally.&#8221;

Granger began his career as a security specialist with the United States Air Force in Italy and Germany, specializing in high-risk resource and dignitary protection, computer controlled security systems, and security team supervision. After leaving the military, he went on to direct all loss prevention and investigative activity for two large West Coast retail chains. In 2001 Granger joined the staff of Oregon Health & Science University in SW Portland, first as the Director of Public Safety and later adding supervision of Transportation and Parking. Among other things, he supervised security on the iconic OHSU tram.

Since joining the Reed community tis summer Granger read the Odyssey, talked Ezra Pound with incoming Dean of Faculty Elle nStauder, and enjoyed the opportunity to be closer to the day-to-day operations. He firmly believes that the Student Handbook shuld be required reading for all CSOs and has been stagin formal and informal meetings wiht students to learn about how they perceive the culture of Reed.

Granger intends to spend the first few months of the semester interpreting the aspects of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Implementation Plan that specifically refer to the role of Community Safety. While the Plan was approved in the fall of 2009, he hopes to provide a basis for consistency through a series of departmental directives that will address officer protocol when responding to an incident.

Aware of the controversial nature of these issues, Granger advocates for an approach that incorporates the basics of the Honor Principle with the need for procedural clairty for Community Safety employees.

Responding to textual ambiguities around possession of &#8220;distributable amounts&#8221; of alcohol, e describes the need for a &#8220;resonableness standard&#8221; in the way that CSOs assess a situation. He explains, &#8220;a resonableness standard would take into account both the quanitty and the manner in which [the alcohol i sbeing possessed,&#8221; thus avoiding potentially arbitrary possession limits. He has also submitted a proposal to allow students to appeal a confiscation to Student Services if they feel they were mistakenly targeted by a CSO.

Additoinally, he plans to develop a procedural checklist for officers responding to incidents of sexual assault. As a member of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals, Granger has extensive experiencein collaborative threat assessment that he hopes to bring to bear in working with representatives from Residence Life, Student Services, and Health and Councseling to provide supportive preemptive intervention for students that are a risk to themselves or other members of the community.

Granger hopes to launch two blogs this fall on behalf of Community Safety. The first will provide a weekly CSO blotter available through the Reed server. The second will act as a sounding board for new Community Safety procedure, giving community members an opportunity to comment on departmental directives before they are codified.

When asked about some of his impressions of Reed culture, he explained, &#8220;if students aren&#8217;t signed on to something you want to do, it&#8217;s going to be a long road ahead.&#8221; He hopes that the blogs, along with appearances at Senate meetings, will provide a space for moderated dialogue and ongoing feedback. After two months, he said, &#8220;the job&#8217;s a kick.&#8221; His office is located at 28 West but he can often be seen around campus catting with students and administers alike about what makes Reed so special. Rick Fagerstrom, former interim Director of Community Safety, will continue on in role of Operations Manager.
