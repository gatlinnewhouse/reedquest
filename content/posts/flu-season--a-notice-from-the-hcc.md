According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this year’s flu season is shaping up to be one of high severity, with all states except Hawaii reporting elevated influenza activity. Oregon is reporting high, widespread flu activity, which is likely to continue for several more weeks.

Most people with the flu have only a mild illness and rest, fluids, and use of fever reducing medication at home is adequate to treat symptoms. However this year’s flu strain has caused serious complications in some individuals. People with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, pregnancy, or immunocompromising conditions are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications. People who are at high risk of serious flu complications and get flu symptoms or who are very sick should discuss antiviral drugs with their provider as soon as possible.

In adults, emergency warning signs of flu are:

* Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
* Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen
* Sudden dizziness
* Confusion
* Severe or persistent vomiting
* Flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worsening cough

If you’re not sure whether you require medical care, call the Health and Counseling Center (HCC) at (503)-777-7281 and ask to speak to a nurse about your concerns.

Please help keep yourself and your community healthy and prevent the spread of the flu virus by taking these steps:

* Self isolate: the CDC recommends that you stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone (without the use of a fever-reducing medicine, such as Tylenol).
* Anyone who has not yet been vaccinated for flu should do so now. Local pharmacies have a supply of the vaccine, costs of which are generally covered by insurance. Be sure to bring your insurance card with you.
* Cover your cough and sneeze with a tissue or cough/sneeze into the crook of your arm. Flu virus is most commonly spread by droplets when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
* Wash your hands often with soap and water. This can substantially reduce your risk of infection.
* Don’t share food and drink with others.
