White flakes floated down from a gray sky on Monday evening as students hurried along the pathways throughout campus. Over the course of just a few hours, the sky had become swathed in dusky smog; a muted orange sun shone feebly through the haze. Conditions only worsened on Tuesday, and though the high temperature peaked at a ‘mere’ 93 degrees due to blocked solar radiation, some campus residents longed for the promised 102 degree high in lieu of the near-apocalyptic weather they faced instead. 

Wildfires in varying degrees of severity are currently raging throughout central California, western Oregon, and Washington, as well as eastern Idaho. Over Labor Day weekend, Portland too was confronted with the effects of the hot, dry summer, as the Eagle Creek wildfire started blazing near the Cascade Locks, about 40 miles east of Portland. 

According to several local news sources, the fire was caused by human activity—namely, fireworks.  After it began on September 1, the Eagle Creek Fire grew quickly, and by Tuesday afternoon it had grown to 10,000 acres and was not contained. Several rural residences were evacuated and sections of I-84 were shut down. Large swathes of forest along the beautiful Columbia River Gorge have also been damaged. 

The air quality in Portland gradually worsened throughout Monday and Tuesday as smoke and ashes blew in from the east. The National Weather Service issued an air quality alert, stating that “pollutants in smoke can cause burning eyes, runny nose, aggravate heart and lung diseases, and aggravate other serious health problems. Limit outdoor activities and keep children indoors if it is smoky.” The alert will be in place until noon today. 

As of 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday, Airnow.gov listed the AQI (Air Quality Index) in the Portland area as 246. Levels of 200 or higher are considered “very unhealthy,” whereas levels under 50 are considered “good.” AQI is largely based on the concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers). This is a particularly dangerous form of pollution because particles that small can pass through the lung tissue and enter the bloodstream. 

Several Reed residents chose to don surgical masks as they traveled between buildings. Many others decided to wait it out indoors. “It just hits me every time I go outside… I don’t feel like I’m actually outside, it’s like it’s closing me in. The air also makes my eyes sting, so I’d rather stay inside,” commented Emma-Jo Ruzicka. 

The air is expected to clear up later in the week. Fire departments are prioritizing containment of the Eagle Creek wildfire, but their success is still unclear.
