Many Reed students have come to see the CSOs as nothing but a uniform. In order to remedy that situation, we took an informative and very serious questionnaire to 28 West, which the CSOs answered in a very serious way. Each week we will profile a CSO, asking them revealing questions and trying to get a really embarrassing picture of them. This week, we talk to Gary Granger, Director of Community Safety.

_What is your name?  _

__Gary Granger

&nbsp;

_What shift do you work?_ 

I usually start “when young Dawn with her rose-red fingers” reaches over the Grove into my office—and I occasionally hang around Sallyport in the evenings.

&nbsp;

_Why did you become a CSO?_

Like most Reed students I’ve talked to, I like doing things that are intense and challenging.

Irrelevant.  I’m a left-coast sort of guy.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite food?_

VooDoo doughnuts, especially on 4/20

&nbsp;

_Have any hobbies?_ 

When I’m not admiring bongs in the evidence locker, I like to climb trees, backpack, and hang out with my daughters—often at the same time.

&nbsp;

_What is your Spirit Animal?_

Corvus corax (_The Common Raven_)

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite book?_

Deep Survival, Laurence Gonzales (_A book about how people react to life threatening situations-for example, an SU dance party.)_

_What are you rocking out to in the CSO-mobile?_

Taylor Swift (hey, my girls are Tweens)

&nbsp;

_Who is your celebrity crush?_

Has to be my wife.

&nbsp;

_Who is your favorite childhood cartoon character?_

Mighty Mouse—gotta love the operatic theme song.

&nbsp;

_A freak accident has endowed you with special powers, making you into a super-CSO. What would your super power be?_

The ability to extinguish flaming materials with a glance—through walls.

&nbsp;

_What is your favorite thing about your job?_

Students.
