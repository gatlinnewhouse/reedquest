    Dylan Jordan '12 wants to know what society is evolving to become.
  </p>
</div>

Many historians over the ages have attempted to go beyond the study of history as it happened in specific cases, and instead analyze the grand arc of history as an inevitable march towards a fixed terminus. Though events can unfold as they may, it is theorized, society will always evolve through certain processes towards some particular new form, the inescapable result of the very logic of human behavior. Many of these determinist philosophies are utopian, maintaining that the culmination of historical development will be the perfect society; however, some are more pessimistic.

> “History is like an organism that&#8217;s born, goes through the life stages, and then dies.”

It is the tension between utopian and pessimistic theories of societal determinism that Dylan Jordan of Montgomery, Alabama will explore in his History thesis, “Decadence and Totalitarian Society.” His thesis, which he is working on with Professor Daniela Blei, will look at how the work of Oswald Spengler, a German historian and philosopher of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, was interpreted and adapted into the brand of Marxism promoted by the Frankfurt School later in the century.

Spengler&#8217;s best-known work, “The Decline of the West,” promoted a “pessimistic” view of world history, says Dylan. Its “logic of history” detailed the “inevitable decline of artistic and intellectual virtues.” Societies would begin as cultures, which were refined and pure, then “a peoples&#8217; or culture&#8217;s spirit, or artistic and intellectual talents, are projected outwards into the world.” When this happens, “a society loses its culture and becomes what Spengler calls a civilization, which is like a vulgarized form of a culture.” As an example, Dylan points to the Olympics of Greek society and the gladiators of Roman society: In this change, “art became entertainment” as society shifted from being “philosophical and reflective” to being “managerial, technical, and imperial.” “Spengler is entirely opposed to the idea of historical progress,” says Dylan. Instead, he explains, “history is like an organism that&#8217;s born, goes through the life stages, and then dies.”

These ideas were very interesting to the Frankfurt School, a group of mostly German social theorists in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. Their philosophy was rooted in Marxism, which also promotes a deterministic theory of society. However, in this theory, society revolutionizes through distinct stages to culminate at the utopian end form of communism. Two philosophers of the Frankfurt School in particular, Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse, were compelled by Spengler&#8217;s ideas on mass culture and saw the appropriation of culture as a form of social domination against the lower classes. However, Dylan says, they had a problem in reconciling Spengler&#8217;s pessimism with their hope for an eventual reorganization of society along more just lines. If Spengler&#8217;s theory is right, says Dylan, “human agency and human creativity are impotent,” and there is “no possibility for development of class consciousness among the proletariat,” a necessary condition for revolution.

Dylan analyzes Adorno and Marcuse as having come up with essentially two ways to “sidestep” Spengler&#8217;s historical cycle. First, they looked to high art and the Frankfurt school&#8217;s own critical theory to “become storehouses for the emancipatory potential,” and thus “preserve a space that&#8217;s not appropriated by the mass culture industry.” Second, and, as Dylan says, “more promising,” Adorno and Marcuse “held out hope for new creative energies that can be unleashed in the midst of decay of civilization.” Out of economic collapse, social dysfunction, and poverty, “the seeds of decay can grow into the beginning of a new cultural paradigm.” Again, this new cultural paradigm would be begun in the sphere of culture and art. Although they&#8217;re accepting Spengler&#8217;s claim that Western culture has “crystallized into a totalitarian stasis,” he goes on, Adorno and Marcuse are “trying to envision a way that the breakdown of structures will happen and be a good thing.”

Dylan says these philosophies offer ample grounds for examination, with plenty of room for questioning: “Is Adorno and Marcuse&#8217;s &#8216;adoption&#8217; of Spengler&#8217;s themes an admission of the failure of [the people] to emancipate themselves from a totalitarian society that appears to be impenetrable? Does the recourse to culture and art, as opposed to politics, indicate the impossibility or extreme unlikelihood of emancipation?” If the world is indeed evolving towards a new future, the fate of society hangs in the balance.
