Although students who work as tutors, librarians, and SU cleaners are paid on an hourly basis, many student positions are paid with a monthly stipend, including the most important jobs in student body government. Senators, Judicial Board members, Honor Council members, and others fall into this category. When calculated as an hourly wage, many of these stipends fall far below minimum wage, according to information gathered by _The Quest_.

However, this system is still legal and reasonable, according to Controller Tracy Frantel and Janie Hinkle-Clayton, both from Reed’s Business Office. The College does not consider these positions as employees, and thus they are not subject to wage laws. Instead, these student body jobs fall somewhat awkwardly between volunteer work, academic work, and paid labor. Frantel and Hinkle-Clayton noted that some other colleges do not pay what they call student body “officers” at all. No college of which Frantel and Hinkle-Clayton were aware paid those “officers” by an hourly wage. These student body workers do fill out time sheets in order to receive their monthly stipends, but only include a pre-agreed amount of hours in each monthly time sheet, using some of the hours that they worked.

To examine the issue of student body wages, The Quest sent inquiries to current student body workers in order to ascertain relative workloads and compare them to the monthly stipends. Below is a table showing the monthly stipends of several student body positions and the estimated average weekly workload, which are combined to yield an effective hourly wage (assuming 4 weeks is equivalent to 1 month).  The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour, while in Oregon the minimum is $8.80 per hour.

It should be noted that this data is based on self-reporting and could be improved with more responses from current and past student body workers. In fact, the Student Body Wage Review Board (SBWRB) is currently undertaking a broad study of student body wages.  The board was created in Fall 2010, but has yet to present any recommendations to Senate. This semester, however, it intends to do so.  According to Shabab Ahmed Mirza ’13, who worked for the SBWRB in Spring 2011 and works with it now as a senator, the board “should realistically be able to present a report to Senate at the first meeting after spring break.” Mirza allows that the board has been “disappointingly slow” and takes partial blame, but also points to the difficulties in getting students involved in community affairs.

Currently on the SBWRB are former senator Jenny Calvert-Warren ’12 and Li Zha ’12. A third member is still being sought through Appointments Committee. According to Calvert-Warren, the board is currently “looking at SB budgets from the last ten years.” The large disparities between the effective hourly wages of different student body jobs, evident in simple data collected for this report, underline the importance of the SBWRB’s task.

Below are descriptions of the first few jobs covered by this report. Future articles will cover other student body jobs.

**Judicial Board**

Thanks to recent wage increases beginning this semester, J-Board members now earn much more than they used to. New members earn $250 per month instead of $150, continuing members earn $300 per month, and the two co-chairs earn $500 per month instead of $175.

In hourly terms this still may not amount to much. New J-Board members are told to expect 20-30 hour weeks and occasional, grueling weeks of over 60 hours of work. Besides the amount of work, the level of stress involved in hearing cases can be a large burden. Co-Chair Tevon Edwards ’12 estimates that J-Board members only earn “roughly half minimum wage.” Co-Chair Megan Jones ’12 explains that she calculates the stipend as a matter of helping with rent and groceries, not as an hourly wage.

Both affirm**,** however, that working for J-Board is a form of community service comparable to volunteering and similar to academics, and therefore it should be compensated differently than other jobs. Nonetheless, both Edwards and Jones express their gladness about the pay raise, for which J-Board had been advocating for several years. J-Board wages, Edwards says, should at least be “equitable.” In the past, Edwards himself was initially unable to join J-Board because of the low pay, and J-Board had problems retaining members.

**Paradox managers**

The two managers of the Paradox, currently Mark Hintz ’12 and Becca Roberts ’12, earn the highest amount of any worker with a monthly stipend controlled by Senate, receiving $725 per month. However, their case is very different from that of other student body workers: their wages come from the Paradox’s revenue rather than from student body funds. In addition, their long hours (approximately 20 hours per week each) translate their stipend into a reasonable $9.06 per hour, not much more than regular Paradox employees (who earn $8.80 per hour).

Hintz and Roberts assert that the Paradox has done a good job of operating as a “non-profit student-run business,” as is specified in the bylaws passed by Senate. According to them, the previous managers made only $2,400 in profit over the 2010-2011 school year, roughly “a half-week&#8217;s revenue.” In addition, they state that the Paradox’s prices are lower than Commons and First Cup Coffeehouse, and “fairly low by comparison with other shops.” Finally, they point out that the managers’ wages make up only about $300 of each week’s expenditures of approximately $5000 on labor and supplies, or 6%.
