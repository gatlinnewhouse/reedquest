The news hit me harder than the death of any other celebrity, public figure, distant relative, or even close friend could: Horse\_ebooks is intentional; Horse\_ebooks is people; most of all, Horse\_ebooks is dead. It is a melancholic moment, beyond bittersweet; it is a betrayal, a vindication, a success, and a sadness. Horse\_ebooks has been a companion to me for a long time now, it guided me through my first year at Reed with its ruminations, recommendations, and random snippets that seemed to always just make sense, in a sort of way. Nothing else could have given us such profound wisdom that fits the situation, like “Crying is great exercise” after a bad paper conference, or “Unfortunately, as you already know, people” when you just want to sit alone in your dorm room. Horse\_ebooks filled a hole for many people on campus. A giant, horse-sized hole. Now we are only left with the fond memories, of cracking open our laptops to anxiously find a 140-character present, of sharing the best snippets with our friends at lunch, of gasping at the sight of a thought so perfect, so right for the moment, of, well, Horse\_ebooks.

So what really is Horse\_ebooks, then? The details are still coming out, but what we do know is the central folklore behind the Twitter feed, how we introduced it to our friends, the mythos of the mysterious spambot. It was created by the Russians, we said, it was to sell ebooks about horses. It would take random bits from equine-centered digital media and throw it up onto Twitter, in hopes that some wayward hippophiles and Doug Spinks of the world would maybe find something new to read while not polishing their saddles. But, we whispered conspiratorially, something went wrong. The code was messed up, or something like that, who really knows. What we really know, though, is that Horse\_ebooks isn’t selling ebooks about horses. Instead, Horse\_ebooks soars the information superhighway, scanning the internet like a glorious digital Pegasus, reaching down into the stream and taking a random string of words into its mouth. Horse\_ebooks would then project those words onto its Twitter feed, for its over 212,000 followers to see.

“Oh my god, look at Horse_ebooks right now” was a common expression, not only among my group of friends, but all around Reed. I would excitedly look at my friends as they read the latest update. How could some failed spambot produce such perfect statements as “What do you need to do to be” and “Who else wants to become a golf ball”? It seemed too good to be real.

And it was. Last Friday, Susan Orlean, writing for _The New Yorker_, ever the bearer of bad news, revealed that the masterminds behind Horse_ebooks are not computerized, but real, living, breathing people. Namely, Jacob Bakkila and Thomas Bender, two Brooklynites that have been working behind the account for two years. The origin of the Twitter feed appears to be true; a Russian programmer did make it, and it did go beautifully wrong, and then Bakkila snapped it up and began pulling the strings holding up the horse’s glistening shanks and flowing mane. He calls it performance art. He also calls it done. “No one wants to work on a painting forever,” Bakkila told _The New Yorker_. “When it’s done it’s done.”

Where does that leave us, then, the loyal followers of the horse? I frankly do not know. As I write this, I am shedding an actual tear. It’s an incredibly hollow feeling; like if you were to just find out that your girlfriend is dead but also that she has been cheating on you for quite some time now, and you don’t really know how to process this information, because you thought she might be cheating on you and that sucks pretty bad, but now that she is dead it is hard to muster up any feelings of anger anyways. I do not know what to be more sad about: the death or the betrayal.

There is also a weird feeling of happiness and success. Sure, this Twitter feed would have been even more amazing if it was completely in control of itself, but think about it. This may be the greatest hoax of the internet, and we are all part of it. This is making me rethink my entire stance on how much intent really matters in art and creation in general. Does the serendipity really matter to Horse_ebooks? Is the feeling of monumental contact with the great randomness of the universe lost now that we know that contact is with a human being? Or does that mean that humankind is the greatest randomness of our universe?

I haven’t decided yet what to make of that. All I know for now is that I am sad. I miss Horse\_ebooks. I wish I could have one last message, one last little note, saying it is going to be okay. Telling me that I can actually learn Russian, that I can survive this workload, that I have friends that love me, that life is wonderful if you just look, that “we all agree, no one looks cool”, to “include everything,” or even “How to tastefully interrogate a used car.” Something. I just want something, please, Horse\_ebooks. I love you.

“Everything happens so much.”

Not anymore, Horse_ebooks, not anymore.
