**Flu Clinic**
  
**Thursday, October 7
  
10:00am-3:00pm, GCC-BC**

The college is once again offering flu shots free to Reed faculty, staff and students. The 2010-2011 vaccine provides protection against A/H1N1 (pandemic) influenza and two other influenza viruses, influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B.  It will not prevent illness caused by other viruses. The vaccine takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the shot. Protection lasts about a year.

**Choose Your Cause!
  
Monday October 11
  
11:30am-1:30pm, Commons
  
7:00-9:00pm, Library Lobby**

Come hang out with Reed&#8217;s Amnesty International group in Commons and the Library Lobby. Take a break from studying, eat some food and do some activism! A number of letters and petitions on human rights issues will be available for everyone to sign and discuss.

**Queer Prom
  
Friday, October 8
  
10:00pm-2:00am, the SU**

Revel in the cheesiness of high school dances, minus standing awkwardly in the corner or not even attending. Being an introvert doesn&#8217;t count at a prom filled with other introverts! You don&#8217;t need to bring a date. Show up with your friends, or come meet other hotties, queer and otherwise. Bring Reed ID because we&#8217;re charging off-campus guests at the door.

**RAW Theme Unveiling
  
Friday, October 8
  
7:00pm, The Paradox**

Reed Arts Week is a five-day student-run arts festival where both visiting and student artists present visual and performing arts at Reed. Join us for the unveiling of the theme for this year&#8217;s festival. Refreshments will be provided, as well as applications for student art projects.

**Reed Film Society: Intro Meeting
  
Saturday, October 9
  
4:00-7:00pm, Bio 19**

We’re having an introductory meeting so that we can talk and schedule our events for the rest of the semester. There will likely be some sort of introductory movie to give everyone a feel for what the group might be like.

**QA Potluck
  
Thursday, October 7
  
6:00-7:00pm, Student Center**

Queer Alliance is having a potluck social! Come hang out and chat!

**Help Make a Movie!
  
Thursday, October 7
  
6:00-7:30pm, GCC-B**

The Sexual Assault Task Force is making a movie, but we can&#8217;t do it without your help! The general idea is to set the movie at a party and show how sexual assault can occur in both typical situations, as well as those you might not have considered before. We plan to use this movie during freshmen orientation, as well as other relevant events. Please help us make this happen! We need writers, brainstormers, and the generally creative to help us write a script.

**ARG Game Night
  
Friday, October 8
  
6:00pm, the SU**

Do you like Settlers of Catan? Scrabble? Clue? Carcassone? Board games in general? The Association of Reed Gamers invites you to join us as we bring our games out of their dungeon lair! We&#8217;ll have tons of things for you to play, so come on down and bring a friend.

**Dia del Encuentro (The ‘Reed’ Discovery of America)
  
Friday, October 8
  
5:00-9:00pm, Winch**

Día del Encuentro (The ‘Reed’ Discovery of America), will be celebrated the final weekend prior to Columbus’ arrival to the New World on October 12. The night will start with a game reminiscent of capture the flag, followed by a dinner in Winch to commemorate the indigenous cultures of Latin America.

**Fall Canyon Day and Dedication Ceremony
  
Saturday, October 9
  
9:00am-3:00pm, Fish Passage on SE 28th**

The canyon expansion project is almost complete! Help celebrate the restoration efforts that have expanded the Reed canyon west of campus. Restoration efforts have created an ideal habitat for wild salmon returning to the Johnson Creek watershed. Plant native trees and shrubs in the newly-restored canyon area east of SE 28th Avenue. Tools, training, food, and fun will be provided. Canyon tour and music, food, and activities for children, such as pumpkin painting and a salmon-themed craft will be available. Dedication ceremony at 11am.

**Econ Junior Qualifying Examination**

On behalf of Prof. Parker, if you are now a junior and expect to write a thesis beginning spring semester 2011, you need to take the Economics Junior Qualifying Examination, and you must sign up for it immediately outside Lois Hobbs’ office, CC-112.  (If you are effectively a junior, but are registered as a sophomore, it may mean that you have never filed a Declaration of Major form.  If so, file that form promptly with the Registrar’s office.) The Qualifying Examination will be administered on Friday, 11/5, from 3-6 PM in CC-228.  Micro and macro study questions are available from Lois Hobbs.

**Gray Fund 20th Anniversary**

The Gray Fund team is beginning the planning of the 20 year anniversary of the Gray Fund/ Reed’s centennial celebration for campus. For this, we are looking to get ideas from the campus community as a whole in order to truly make this event one to celebrate these milestones . Our plan is to host a large-scale outdoor concert in the quad in September of 2011 and a variety show  style event at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in April of 2012. This second event will consist of a variety of acts, potentially including poets, storytellers, musicians, comedians, and others. Our primary focus for these are acts with Reed/ Portland/ Northwest ties, but are also open to larger caliber and more national headliners. There are boxes for ideas located in the Library Lobby and Commons. Also, any ideas you may have for this can be sent to [&#x47;&#x46;&#x43;&#x65;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x62;&#x72;&#x61;&#x74;&#x69;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1]. All suggestions are wanted and encouraged
