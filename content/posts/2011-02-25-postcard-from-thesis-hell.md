I dove so deep that I can’t find my way out. I wander through a dark coral reef of obscure journals and ambiguous data, unable to make any sense of my journey. I had a plan—once—I know I did. But it was lost among the anemones and sea cucumbers. Now, I struggle to make something real out of these old papers and abstract ideas.

Because that’s all I have for company: the refuse of older academics. My thesis has grown so particular that no one else in my department, not even my adviser, knows much of anything about such specificity. I receive regular reassurance from him, but I fight constantly with fears that my claims are unfounded. What if the theories in which I’ve put so much faith are words alone and nothing more? The real battle isn’t research or writing, it’s convincing myself that my ideas are worth exploring and documenting.

Yet I realized just yesterday that this isn’t new. I’ve been coming up with my own theories since Hum, translating them into words and fighting to turn them into viable, living ideas. When I was just a freshman I was already making bullshit arguments about the competing social structures endorsed in the gospels of Matthew and John. I’ve been making things up and taking risks for years; the only difference now is one of scale.
