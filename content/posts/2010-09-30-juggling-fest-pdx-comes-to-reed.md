[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-340" style="margin: 7px;" title="juggling" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/juggling.jpg?resize=216%2C162" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />][1]A girl dressed in bright neon clothing balances on a unicycle. “This is easy,” she says. Unphased by the crowed of people watching her, she thrusts three plastic knives into the air, gracefully catching each of them. Upon witnessing her own success—and the roaring applause—she sighs in relief. “Actually, I’ve been practicing that for weeks.”

Such a spectacle was not uncommon at the 18th Annual Portland Juggling Festival, which took place in the Sports Center this past weekend. Circus art enthusiasts from across the Northwest flocked to the festival to exhibit their skills, share their knowledge, and watch performances by some of the best jugglers in the world.

This year saw guest performers like Doug Sayers, winner of the 2009 International Jugglers Association Stage Competition. Workshops and open juggling, the two main focuses of the festival, allowed jugglers to learn new techniques and practice them in an open space.

“Everyone seems really excited. I think this is one of the best turnouts we’ve ever had,” said Stuart Celarier ‘83.

Celarier, who now teaches juggling at Reed, started the festival as a way to teach and promote juggling in the community. Celarier said that this sense of community is also fostered on a weekly basis in his juggling class. Jugglers from Portland are allowed to use the Sport Center’s facilities in exchange for teaching a lesson in the class.

“The great thing about juggling is its ability to bring people together,” said Celarier. “I see students who take the juggling class then come to the fest and teach or take part in a performance. It’s great to see people from Reed and worldwide juggling community come together and get behind a common interest.”

Celarier said that this spirit of community is extended to Club Renegade, a raucous and informal talent show which encourages jugglers to show off what they have recently been working on. The goal, Celarier explained, is not to have a professional performance, but for jugglers to enjoy themselves and share their interests with their peers.

“The motto is, ‘If it were any better than this, than it wouldn’t be Club Renegade.’ I think that idea in itself speaks to the spirit that’s behind the event,” Celarier said.

Student involvement in the festival this year ranged from conducting workshop to hosting student-run events. On Friday, student Isabel Cylinder taught a workshop on introductory poi spinning.

On Saturday night, Weapons of Mass Distraction hosted their annual burn, in which many of festival’s performers attended and participated. While not officially affiliated with the festival, the Saturday night burn has become something of a festival staple.

“We had one of the best burns I’ve ever seen,” said Gray Davidson, a senior and member of Reed’s fire troupe. “Some of the people who were on our campus are the best at what they do so it made for a really amazing event.”

“People from all over the world come to the juggling festival, and it’s an incredible opportunity for us to learn new things,” said Davidson.
