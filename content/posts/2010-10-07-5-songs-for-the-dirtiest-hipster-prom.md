Remember high school? You know, back when you weren’t a hipster? You may not have been preaching the gospel of that obscure freak-folk collective, but nevertheless, the music they played at your senior prom most likely wasn’t tailored to your “alternative” musical proclivities. Instead, you probably had some lame DJ with iTunes crossfader encouraging you to crank dat Soulja Boy while wearing apple bottom jeans (don’t forget the boots with the fur). So this week, we here at the Quest have turned back the clocks and written a bit of alternate history about your prom. Sit back and crack open a PBR, because here come five songs that would have been played if your high school was dominated by hipsters.

**“Homecoming” – The Teenagers**
  
A deliciously danceable criticism of teenage culture, veiled behind ostensibly misogynist lyrics. What more can you really ask for?

**“Sexy Bitch” – David Guetta feat. Akon**
  
“I’m trying to find the words to describe this girl, without being disrespectful,” remarks Akon in this Guetta-produced electro house banger. The hipster in you will most surely appreciate the irony Akon delivers in describing the female in question as none other than, you guessed it, a “sexy bitch.”

**“Too Young” – Phoenix**
  
A cheesy, ‘80s-sounding number by the gods of indie rock that will cater to your unfashionable predilection for anachronism (remember, it’s not “retro” unless it’s cool). It’ll make you reminisce about those faded high-rise jeans that you bought… last week at American Apparel the bins.

**“Autobahn Music Box” – Cut Copy**
  
No prom would be complete without a slow dance. The chorus really says it all: “I don’t want to hear a love song.” This synthpoppy piece of soft rock will allow you express your teenage aspirations of love as well as your cynicism toward it.

**&#8220;Once in a Lifetime&#8221; – Talking Heads**
  
Admit it, you totally wanted to request this at your high school prom, but were way too embarrassed or were shut down by ego-tripping proto-bros. Luckily, being a hipster requires some affinity for the Talking Heads. And seriously, would there be any other way to end a hipster prom?

**BONUS SONG:**

“Skeleton Key” – Margot and the Nuclear So and So’s
  
This one is for those lucky sons-of-bitches who get their date off the dance floor and into the backseat. Because really now, what’s better than locking lips to a lush arrangement of violins, lap steels, banjos, and melodicas?
