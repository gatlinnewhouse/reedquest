Alcohol or other intoxicants were involved in at least 70% of cases of sexual assault reported in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 school years, according to information collected by Community Safety. In a further 17% of cases, it was reported “unknown” whether intoxicants were involved.

Out of 36 total reported cases in the two school years, assailants were more frequently under the influence of alcohol and other intoxicants, with 64% of assailants reported under the influence at the time of the event. Thirty six percent of victims were reported as under the influence.

Intoxication is an important factor in many assaults, says Director of Community Safety Gary Granger, who investigated the cases. “If you pull intoxication out of those, at least half of them don&#8217;t happen,” he says.

Of reported cases, 72% occurred on campus, 17% occurred off campus, and the location of 11% was unknown.

Most cases occurred within the community, with about 14% of cases in the 2011-12 school year involving a non-Reed assailant and a Reed victim. There were no known incidences of unknown persons assaulting Reed students on or off campus, says Granger.

Associate Dean for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Jyl Shaffer could not be reached for comment.
