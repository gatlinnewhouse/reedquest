Have you ever wondered why you don’t have more than two eyes or why they’re on your face instead of the top of your head? During early embryonic development, the cells destined to be your eyes are indistinguishable from other cells in the developing brain. Then, in response to specific changes in their environment, the future eye cells start to express different genes than their neighbors and even start to move differently.

Defects in the early events that distinguish eye cells from other brain cells give rise to a wide variety of congenital diseases including anopthalmia (lack of eyes), micropthalmia (tiny eyes), and cyclopia (a single eye). To understand the molecular basis for these diseases, scientists turn to basic biology, investigating the mechanisms that pattern and shape the embryonic brain.

In our Developmental Neurobiology Seminar, we recently discussed a paper that used zebrafish to examine the early events that lead to eye formation. In particular, the paper looked at how cells in the developing brain respond to molecular changes in their local environment to turn into eyes. Cells respond to environmental cues, which can arise from other cells, by switching specific genes on or off. Changes in gene expression are a normal part of embryonic development, patterning the embryo so that cells that make up eyes, ears and brain end up in the right place in the adult organism.

However, within the embryo there is a plethora of cells and signals. So how do cells make sense of all different extrinsic signals? By expressing specific receptors on their surfaces, cells have ‘selective hearing,’ so only certain signals are picked up. Cell ‘behavior’ results from the combined effects of the type and intensity of the signals they receive. One category of ‘behavior’ is the creation, or synthesis, of proteins from genes, resulting in the overall gene expression pattern of the cell. Scientists can ‘listen in’ on cellular conversations by detecting gene expression patterns with colorful chemical markers.

In 2005, a group of scientists ‘listened’ to the cellular conversations that cause a group of undifferentiated embryonic zebrafish cells to begin to identify as “eye”. The authors were interested in the interactions between two signalling pathways. They conducted a series of experiments, varying the intensities of one signal or the other. They found a surprising result: When one of the signals was expressed in the absence of the other, the zebrafish embryos mapped out huge eyes. When the other signal was expressed in the absence of the first, eyes were absent or markedly reduced. When both signals were reduced, normal eye development occurred. Since the errors in eye specification occurred when the ratio of these two signals was altered, the researchers concluded that these two pathways have an antagonistic effect. Through the coordinated action of two signals, a group of undifferentiated cells are able to specify an eye that is neither too large, or too small (or nonexistent!), but just the right size.

Since the publication of the paper we read, more information on how these two pathways work together in other contexts has come out. Florencia Cavodessia, the primary author of the paper, is continuing to study how these two pathways interact and is particularly interested in how these two signals affect genetic pathways and cell differentiation throughout the brain. After all, eyes are only one of the many chapters in the story of embryonic development, and there’s lots more to be discovered!
