As soon as the sun decided to take a peek down on Portland from its cozy spot above those thick grey clouds perpetually pregnant with rain I, your sunshine-deprived Queditor, picked up the children I was babysitting from their spot on the sofa where they had been watching television – in a comatose trance – and dropped them in the backyard, locking the door behind us. My charges, surprised at this sudden change of scenery, were first left blinking in shock at the bright light shining down from above as though it were some alien force that left them awestruck. Upon realizing where they really were, they began to cry and beat on the locked door.

“WE WANT TV!” howled the four-year-old.

“TV!” echoed his two-year-old sister.

But I was firm, and after coaxing them with promises of ice cream after we had finished playing in the yard, they conceded defeat. In no time they were happily riding their numerous wheeled devices (bikes, scooters, skateboards, you name it), bouncing on the trampoline, shooting hoops, kicking around a (mostly deflated) soccer ball, and playing a rousing game of wiffle ball. As the family dog lay sprawled out in a pool of sunshine, amusedly watching us as we ran around the yard so heavily littered with his, well, litter, I saw that the kids were clearly having a great time – and so was I. They had all but forgotten about their previous resistance to active playtime. When the sun’s cameo was over we went inside to finger paint and I gave a dramatic reading of Horton Hears a Who as they ate their afternoon snack. It was the best day ever.

Kids keep me in check. Though babysitting can be exhausting at times, I really appreciate the hours I get to spend off campus where my primary focus is making sure that the kid I’m in charge of is happy, healthy, and safe. They remind me of what it means to be human. Kids do not care about politics, fashion, or philosophy. When they are hungry, they are hungry. When they are sleepy, they are sleepy. You get the idea. They’re unafraid to express their feelings even if they sometimes struggle to find the right words to do so. When you’re at Reed and it seems like 90% of the time your conversations are swimming in rhetoric and quotations, it’s so refreshing to hear phrases like “I have to go potty!” and “I want cheese!” and “Play-Doh!” And my favorite phrase of all, one that gets me every time, is “I love you.” Kids are really honest. Even if they are not sure what love really is, they figure if it looks like love and it smells kind of like love then love is what it is. Best of all, you can love anybody – there’s no judgment.

Reedies can be a lot like overgrown kids sometimes. We want our “TV” – we get so caught up in theorizing and analyzing that we forget there’s a world outside beckoning us to come out and just play.

Just this past weekend another Queditor and I attended a concert downtown. By the time we were out bus lines had stopped running so, after calling Radio Cab for a million years only to find out we still hadn’t been matched with a driver, we flagged down a passing taxi.

“You guys look like you go to Reed,” said our driver after we gave him our destination. “You look…nerdy.”

Though that admittedly wasn’t the look I think either of us was going for, it was a backhanded compliment.

“Reed kids are smart, and they got manners,” he continued. “Unlike these PSU kids. And that’s why they don’t have manners – they’re fuckin’ idiots.”

Yeah, we’re pretty special. And people know about it – people outside of Reed have respect for us because we have a reputation. It’s a great one. It’s something to be proud of (even if it’s at the expense of PSU students – sorry guys). All this you-are-not-a-special-snowflake bullshit is really just that – a big, steaming heap of bullshit. We’re all special, and just because that makes the standard of excellence way higher and the standard of “normal” way off whatever it is you believe to be a conventional definition of the term, that doesn’t mean you’re not special.

You’ve decided to take on this journey because, deep down, you had faith you could stick it out for four years. If you lost that faith somewhere along the way, don’t fret. You came here because you have what it takes to make it out. And no, no two Reedies are ever exactly alike. That’s also bullshit. Though we laugh and joke about the “typical Reedie,” at the end of they day we’re all radically different people inside with varying perspectives and that’s what makes this community such an exciting place to learn and grow.

But just because we’re special doesn’t mean it’s okay to treat each other poorly. We can get so wrapped up in self-pity around here that we lose touch with reality. We get caught up in petty arguments, push each others’ buttons, engage in flamewars, complain bitterly and incessantly about minor things, take everything personally, and essentially contribute to the cloud of angst that hangs over campus this time of year. We pride ourselves in being open-minded and progressive. We have a reputation for “good manners” – let’s live up to it! How are we going to leave our mark on anything if we spend all our time holed up and mired in our own sense of self-importance? Being right doesn’t always justify the means of getting there. You can win the argument but lose all your friends – is that really worth it? Real world rules apply here too, you know. It’s not a video game. We don’t get extra lives or points for taking someone else down.

Yes, there are things to be angry about. There are things to protest, to rally for, to lose sleep and grow grey hairs over. I encourage you to fight for those things! Stand behind what you believe in. But be civil. Don’t be judgmental. Act like a kid – be honest. Realize, too, that there are benefits to being in the wrong. Recognize that we are all humans and have feelings! If you make everything a personal attack, you won’t go anywhere. Maybe it’s sad that I only remember that when I’m changing a diaper or explaining that no, yogurt is not a paint substitute, but I’m glad I get those wake-up calls. I can always count on my kids to call it as they see it. I realize that’s a luxury few Reedies can claim, and one I sincerely cherish. So, the moral of the story is tri-fold: a) don’t get so caught up in the details that you lose sight of the big picture, b) you are all very special, and c) shit happens. With that in mind, let’s power through this homestretch. Give it all you got. We’ve only got a few weeks left together, so let’s make the most of it!
