You look and dress like a French impressionist painter and always seem like youâ€™re walking through a dream. I totally dig it. If youâ€™re a modern-day Degas, youâ€™re more than welcome to do a nude painting of me ðŸ˜‰

You: Slightly underweight, cosmopolitan-looking brunette. Youâ€™re quite the looker, but in reality, youâ€™d never stand out in a crowd.

You: crazy glitter panties.
  
Me: letâ€™s bone.
