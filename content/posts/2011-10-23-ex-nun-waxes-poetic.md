The audience beneath the soft chapel lighting quieted down when Crystal Williams stood up to introduce poet Madeline DeFrees to Reed last Thursday. Williams, Dean for Institutional Diversity and Professor of Creative Writing, thanked the present students, faculty and visitors for coming to the event and then listed Defrees&#8217; many accomplishments. The 92-year-old, Oregon-native DeFrees came as part of the Visiting Writers Series that is sponsored by the Department of English.

DeFrees shuffled to the stage with her cane in one hand and her book of poems in the other. At 92, her voice is hoarse and her eyesight weak. Williams had to run out for an extra lamp from her office to better light DeFrees&#8217; podium. But the slow pace of the reading did not detract from the profound effect of her poetry. The audience was patient and some leaned forward to catch every word. When DeFrees paused several times throughout the night to say &#8220;I apologize for having such a scratchy throat,&#8221; the attentive listeners responded with smiles; nobody minded.

DeFrees began the night with a poem from her first collection, _From the Dark Room_ (1964). Most poems began with an anecdote, some of which had an element of humor in them that poked fun at her experience as a nun. Before reading _A Bottle of Blue Nun to My Friends_ DeFrees recalled, &#8220;shortly after I went to Montana, the chairman of the English department decided to have a party in my apartment for me. He suspected that I was not an experienced drinker, so he got the mildest wine he could think of. It was a German wine called Blue Nun. Later, when I was going to a party, I decided to take a bottle of that wine, because I knew that I could handle it.&#8221; Defrees&#8217; charming demeanor came through each reading. Many people stopped by the book signing table to meet the poet afterward. DeFrees sat smiling patiently and willing to greet her fans.

Defrees entered convent life after attending high school at St. Mary&#8217;s academy. She took her vows as Sister Mary Gilbert with the Catholic Congregation of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary and remained a nun until 1973. DeFrees&#8217; first book, _The Springs of Silence_, is an autobiographical work about her experiences in the convent. She has said that she left the Sisters of the Holy Names because “religious life and poetry both demand an absolute commitment.”

Although DeFrees did not begin to publish poetry until her forties, she wrote her first poem for a school assignment at age 11. Defrees has since published eight collections of poetry; her most recent work, _Spectral Waves_, is available in the Reed Book Store. DeFrees&#8217; poetry, which has received a Guggenheim Fellowship as well as a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, is known for its complexity, its depth of feeling, and its exploration of the tension between religion and secularism.
