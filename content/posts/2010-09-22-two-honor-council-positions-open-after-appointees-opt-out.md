As you may have noticed – thanks in no small part to heavy advertisement and persistent email notifications – there are two Honor Council positions open this semester.

The vacancies are the result of two students, both sophomores, deciding to decline the position for personal reasons.

Vasishth Srivastava was offered the opportunity to continue working for Richard Blumenthal’s senatorial campaign in his home state of Connecticut full-time as a research associate after interning for Mr. Blumenthal this summer, and has chosen to spend the remainder of this fall on the campaign trail. Autumn Dobbins declined due to scheduling conflicts with her Spanish House duties.

According to the Reed Student Handbook, Honor Council it is “a committee of students, faculty, and staff dedicated to promoting the Honor Principle in the Reed community.” Broken down into subcommittees, Honor Council addresses issues within the community that negatively affect the Reed environment, and strives to create a more understanding and ethic campus.

While Honor Council continues their search for new members, Dobbins and Srivastava are taking their time off to really enjoy the additional perks of Reedie life. In a recently released statement, Dobbins explains that “as I live in the Spanish House, I felt it should be put first on my priority list.”

Srivastava, while involved in a race thousands of miles away, encourages interested students to contact him for more information on the Connecticut Senate race or general insight on what it’s like being a part of something so exciting. “It[’s]…not only personally rewarding, it’s an opportunity to try and ensure that my fellow [Connecticut residents] elect a candidate who will fight for them instead of against them,” he says.
