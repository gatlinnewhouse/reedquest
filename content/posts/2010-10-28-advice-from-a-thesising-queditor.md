It&#8217;s completely black and my alarm is screaming. I throw off the covers and stagger across a floor covered with discarded pieces of clothing and old papers. The cat runs under my legs as I stumble into the kitchen, meowing for attention and a bit of food, but the only thing on my mind is the desperate prayer that the sun may rise before I get to class.

Because those summer days on the front lawn are gone. Summer has fled and left us in the hands of torrential downpours and gray, drizzly days. Seniors prepare to chain themselves to thesis desks, and expressions of grim determination hang on every face I see. As deadlines and final projects manifest, I find myself thinking in harsh, numerical terms: 40 pages, two math tests, seven newspapers.

In little more than six weeks the semester is over. Six months after that these seniors will vanish into the ether, floating away to become part of the Reed diaspora as they fight for spots in grad school or a living wage. Our time is fleeting; the best we can do is to cling desperately to the hope that somewhere in the midst of this we can find meaning.

The cruel reality is that fall break made me realize just how busy I am, how many simple pleasures are sacrificed every day to the demands of duty. Last week I not only slept in, but I made dinner and had great conversations over dinner with my housemates. To make room for everything at Reed, I&#8217;ve relentlessly given away my humanity.

But we&#8217;re committed. We&#8217;re stuck. We&#8217;ve tied the knot and divorce would only mean drastic consequences. The class withdrawal deadline swiftly approaches, and there is no turning back. Exhausted by your work? Feel like you&#8217;ve unwittingly overburdened yourself? Too bad, we&#8217;re locked in for the long haul to December.

Embrace the madness. Realize this: You can fold, or you can wrestle the semester to the ground and bash its head into a bloody pulp against the cold, wet cement. Dance for hours, listen to your favorite song on repeat while you rewrite paper after paper, do whatever it takes to seize that passion and refuse to let it go. Don&#8217;t let yourself know that you&#8217;re exhausted and you never will be.

I mean, the truth is that I get up at seven in the morning and stumble back after midnight because I love what I&#8217;m doing. There may be moments of drudgery, but this is infinitesimal next to the profound pride and accomplishment I feel at the end of the week. Do not be convinced that your experience at Reed is somehow ordinary or mundane. Every class, every conversation is an exercise in world-hopping. The treasures that we find along our way will forever alter the way we see the world.

Savor this wild desperation. Own it.
