_New York Times_ reporter and columnist Nicholas Kristof spoke to a packed Kaul Auditorium on Monday about his book _Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide_, which he co-authored with his wife, Sheryl WuDunn. Both the book and Monday&#8217;s lecture draw their title, said Kristof, from a Chinese saying: &#8220;Women hold up half the sky.&#8221;

&#8220;Just as in the 19th century the central moral challenge was slavery, in the 20th century the paramount moral challenge for the world was totalitarianism. In this century, the paramount moral challenge is the oppression [experienced by] so many women and girls throughout the world,&#8221; he said.

Kristof, whose father was a Reedie, has spent much of his career traveling the globe and collecting stories of oppressed women, from a six-year-old Afghan girl who was scheduled to be married off to another family, to a fifteen-year-old girl from Boston who was trafficked, sold for sex, and then arrested.

Kristof explained that while living in China two decades ago, he began to notice the degree to which oppression was targeted to gender. From Hubei Province in 1990, Kristof wrote about how many girls had to drop out of school – the tuition for which cost $13 a year – because, if the choice was necessary, their families would rather send their sons to school. When donations from _Times_ readers made it possible for these girls to finish school, the girls, &#8220;who otherwise would have ended up being dropouts, ended up getting an education and jobs&#8221; that, in turn, aided their communities. In stories like this, said Kristof, we can begin to understand &#8220;the power of educating girls.&#8221;

The lecture centered on specific stories of girls and women who had been oppressed in situations that lay far beyond their control. For instance, Kristof spoke of a girl named Mahabuba, an Ethiopian woman who was married off to a sixty-year-old man when she was twelve years old. Mahabuba got pregnant and gave birth by herself, without anyone, let alone any healthcare professionals, to help her. She had a miscarriage and suffered an obstetric fistula, a hole between either the rectum and the vagina or the bladder and the vagina. After giving birth, Mahabuba could no longer walk, and her fellow villagers, who thought she&#8217;d been cursed by god, took her to a hut on the edge of the village and removed its doors so hyenas could kill her at night. After fighting off the hyenas with a stick, Mahabuba crawled thirty miles to a missionary, where she was able to receive medical attention, and, eventually, become a nurse.

Stories like these illustrate why there is such a significant difference in mortality rates between men and women around the globe. While there may be more women than men in the United States (because, as Kristof explained, women tend to live longer than men giving equal access to healthcare and food), worldwide there are fewer women than men. &#8220;One of the easiest ways&#8221; to prevent stories like Mahabuba&#8217;s &#8220;is through birth control,&#8221; Kristof said.

Education is also high on the agenda for solving this problem. &#8220;There&#8217;s no silver bullets, but education is one,&#8221; Kristof explained. He said that education reduces the birth rate, creates a calming influence, and leads to more successful women who give back to their communities, continuing the cycle of empowerment. &#8220;If you educate a girl, it has a very dramatic effect on the number of children she&#8217;ll have,&#8221; he said.

As for changing these injustices, Kristof said it boils down to &#8220;just getting smarter about how to make a difference.&#8221; There are real challenges that come with corruption and inefficiency when making investments, &#8220;but you also see investments that have a real impact,&#8221; he said. Paying for tuition, digging long-term wells, and deworming kids, which takes one low-cost pill per year, is more effective at getting them to school than is building school themselves.

Kristof also urged the audience, especially Reed students, to travel and study abroad while they can. &#8220;I would really encourage you to find some way of traveling and getting out of your comfort zone,&#8221; he said, laying importance on &#8220;the sense of not knowing what&#8217;s going on&#8221; as a way to better understand the world.

Kristof took questions at the end, one of which was from AnnaLise Bender-Brown &#8217;15. Bender-Brown, who is writing an anthropology thesis on female genital cutting, asked for Kristof&#8217;s response to the criticism that trying to go into non-Western countries and change things might be an imposition of Western cultural ideals. Kristof replied that &#8220;we have to be more clever,&#8221; saying that outside pressure, such as UN resolutions, &#8220;accomplished next to nothing.&#8221; The emphasis, he said, should be placed on grassroots movements from within these countries, which are far more effective at inducing change.

But, said Kristof, while &#8220;we need to be respectful of cultures, there are also certain boundaries.&#8221; According to Kristof, we must weigh this respectfulness &#8220;against human freedoms, autonomy, and equality. Our compassion – our empathy – should not depend upon the other person&#8217;s passport color.&#8221;
