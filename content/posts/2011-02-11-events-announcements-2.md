No Summer Plans?** 
  
The Ecuador Service Project is a student group at Reed that works with a small non-profit in Ecuador to provide aid to indigenous communities. The details of the project change every year based on the specific needs of the communities, but basically it participation involves: a few kick-ass weeks living with indigenous people, speaking Spanish, doing some good-old-fashioned manual labor, and learning some new language (quechua) and culture. Oh, and it’s a pretty darn affordable way to travel and get some life experience this summer (the cost of a plane ticket and some odds and ends). E-mail Rachel Mossey at [&#x6d;&#x6f;&#x73;&#x73;&#x65;&#x79;&#x72;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][4] for more info.

Reedies for Reedies Scholarship Drive Needs Your Help**
  
This Fall, one anonymous Freshman recieved a scholarship made possible by current Reedies. Reedies like you from all class years donated to the Class of 2010 Scholarship, which was then matched by President Diver. This year, we would like to continue the tradition of giving with the new “Reedies for Reedies: Reed-Based Financial Aid” scholarship.

An alumnus from the class of 1996, Venkataraman “Venky” Ganesan, will match all student gifts to “Reedies for Reedies” in amounts of $15 or more to a sum of $3,000. If more than 250 students donate, no matter what the amount, Venky will throw in an additional $2,000. We recognize these are difficult times for everyone, especially students. However, even a small donation can go a long way in helping us meet our participation goal. Let’s do this together!

Questions? Contact [&#x65;&#x76;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x73;&#x63;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][5]
