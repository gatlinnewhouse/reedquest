An ambiguous construction project has been underway near the Grove since before classes began. The mysterious piles of building materials will soon be two new tennis courts and a basketball court.

Facilities Manager Steve Yeadon explained why this was a highly anticipated improvement over the old courts. Most important, the old tennis courts will be removed to make room for a building full of theatre and other excitement.

The new system is more than just a relocation, however. It will improve this noble institution for all concerned. The old courts were difficult to maintain, and the new ones are of a higher quality.Â  The previous location was also far removed from other sports areas. In the new idyllic and central location, tennis players can schmooze with soccer players, people emerging from the gym, or even basketballers, as the new basketball court will be directly adjacent to the tennis courts. The days of improvised free-throw lines will be over, friends.

Weather permitting, the new facilities should be finished around the end of the month. Then, weather permitting, Reed students will be able to try them out. What everyone should be most excited for is the simple truth that a new facility will open up a world of possibilities for fun times. Classy and shiny, it will add spunk and gleam to the many matches that will one day occur on that hallowed ground.
