_Karma Patrol-like Student Job to Increase Nighttime Safety_

Sometime within the next few weeks, health and counseling services will begin accepting positions for two new student jobs on IRIS. The positions, one designated for each gender, requires students to roam the campus on Friday and Saturday nights between the window of 9pm to 3am and out for any serious physical or emotional threats to other students.

While on duty, students in the new position will not be required to report any information on AOD violations and only will communicate with CSOs if greater assistance is needed.

Renn Fayre Karma Guru Jenny Calvert-Warren said that students in the  position will not contact CSOs until after announcing to everyone present that he or do will do so. These students will be given access cards to all the dorm doors and walkie-talkies to communicate.

The idea for the yet-to-be-named position first came from Gary Granger, director of community safety, who requested a Karma Patrol-like group to watch out for students in need throughout the whole year, instead of exclusively at Renn Fayre. He implemented a similar team during Spring/Fall Thesis Parade, and its success motivated him and Smith to move this idea forward.

“It’s about student safety and looking at ways to respond to the need of Reed students after hours,” said Kate Smith, director of health and counseling services.

Nevertheless, Calvert-Warren recognizes the fear that the student workers might just become “toadies to community safety,” a concern that would likely be heightened due to recent hostile responses toward community safety concerning its   reevaluation of Reed’s AOD policy.

Due to the admittedly-real possibility that students will misconceive the purpose of the new position, both Granger and Smith are actively attempting to ensure that the job will privilege student health instead of community safety. These measures include ensuring the position will be solely under the jurisdiction of health and counseling. Furthermore, the  only contact that community safety will have with the student workers is CSOs are required to support a student in need.

Despite this detachment from community safety, wages for the position will come from both the health and counseling and community safety offices. However, Granger will transfer money from his office to Smith’s to ensure that the students are not under the jurisdiction of community safety in any way. Granger stresses that this position is meant to allow CSOs to stay away from student spaces unless they are needed for an emergency.

Granger and Smith have already spoken to Mike Brody and this year’s Karma Gurus about the position, and all seem to be in agreement and the position’s function  and purpose. The only conflict seems to be over what the job should be called. Calvert-Warren admitted that the Karma Gurus did not want the job to explicitly reference Karma Patrol because it is a paid position. The representatives from Kama Patrol suggested a possible alternate name for the position to be ‘Reedwatchers,’ but Granger worries that the name may elicit connotations about the position that he and Smith intend on avoiding.

In an effort to have them out, both Calvert-Warren and Smith suggested that the students in this position may end up wearing a tie-dye t-shirt or lab coat. Granger was particularly excited to have the position available for  upcoming events during this semester, and expects these students to be prepared to provide assistance within the next several weeks.
