Student enrollment in Introductory Biology has seen a dramatic increase, forcing a bit of reorganization on behalf of the Biology department. According to the Office of the Registrar, enrollment for BIO 101 (including lecture and lab component) has increased by 53 students for the 2010-11 school year, resulting in a total enrollment of 244. This can be compared to the 191 students enrolled in BIO 101 last year.

The increase in students has presented some challenges for the Biology department. Keith Karoly, the lead faculty for Introductory Biology this semester, says that the large number of students presents some difficulties, but is manageable. “The greatest challenge for us resulted from the late notice about the high number [of students],” Karoly says, “This required us to make some adjustments on the fly for the first two weeks, but we have now arrived at a stable plan for the remainder of the term.”

One of these adjustments includes the creation of two new lab sections on Monday afternoons, allowing for the maximum lab section enrollment to remain at 24 students. The addition of two lab sections reflects the strain that the enrollment spike has put on the department in managing time and resources.

“The new lab sections and overall increase in enrollment have placed increased demands on the staff and resources of the Biology stockroom,” says Karoly. He adds that this has also led to an increased workload for faculty and staff, who have increased their hours in the lab and grading assignments. Additionally, the biology department is increasing their efforts to encourage students to seek support resources such as the Science Center and tutoring at the DoJo.

Those in the department remain unsure as to the exact cause of the enrollment spike. Ned Knight, a departmental associate in Intro Bio, speculates it to be the result of institutional changes. “The increase appears to be due primarily to two reasons: an unusually large entering freshman class, and the launch of the Environmental Studies interdisciplinary major,” he explains.

The Environmental Studies major, which is in its first year at Reed, requires two semesters of Introductory Biology. Other factors suggested by the department include efforts on behalf of the college to recruit science students and an increased effort to complete the Group C requirement on campus.

However, Karoly says that there is no conclusive way to account for the increase yet. “The college will need to gather more data to determine which [of these] factors have contributed. The simple answer remains that we do not know which, alone or in combination, may be responsible.”

The department argues that this will not affect the quality of the course itself and remains positive.

“I anticipate that the course experience for our students will not differ much from past years,” says Karoly. “We think the adjustments we have made this fall will help us to achieve [our goals for the course].”

Carey Booth, a departmental associate, adds “We’re excited to have so many students in Biology. We are feeling very popular.”
