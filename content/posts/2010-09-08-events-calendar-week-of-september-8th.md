**Reed Outdoor Club Social**
  
September 8, 5-7pm
  
Front Lawn

ROC helps to brainstorm ideas, schedule and enact trips throughout the year to help you step out of the library and explore the beautiful part of the country we live in. We are eager to simply talk about our favorite places or work to get funding for your trip. Do you want to go to the coast? Hike along the Gorge? Visit some hot springs? Or are you interested in more technical trips like climbing or kayaking? ROC is also a club that helps to subsidize Wilderness First Responder training on campus! 

Yes, there will be food!

**Fellatio Rodriguez Summer Kickoff**

Winch

We do not deny that our name is weird and gross, but “F. Rodriguez” is more than just a name. We bring fun and hilarious improv comedy to the Reed Community. Through improvisational theater, we shatter illusion and smash pretense. This has been our mission since four years ago, which is as far as our institutional memory reaches. This year will be no different.

**Friday of Videogames & Deliciousness**
  
Hosted by Handling Controllers Collaboratively
  
September 10, 3-5pm
  
Ping Pong Room

What is a Friday of Videogames & Deliciousness? It’s when we bring games and delicious, home-cooked snacks and you enjoy them. This week, we will be serving up some Super Smash Bros. Brawl alongside plenty of snickerdoodles and shortbread cookies. Join us!

**Reed Theatre: Uncanny Valley**

September 18-19, 2pm
  
Mainstage Theater

Reed Theatre welcomes back Portland’s Hand2Mouth Theatre for their second residency at the college. This fall, Hand2Mouth will create and present the second phase of their production Uncanny Valley, first produced at Reed in May 2010. Hand2Mouth’s team of seven performers-explorers embarks on a daring journey in front of a live audience, leaving the security of ground control in order to recapture our most nostalgic, bittersweet, and lively memories. Join us on a sci-fi adventure into psychic space. These work-in-progress showings are vital to our discoveries. We are refining our inspiration and our training so that we might take you somewhere you never dreamed of going. Tickets: $8 advance or $10 at the door.
