The cigarette butts that dot Reed’s campus now carry a potential fine of $500 each. After two anonymous complaints were filed in November for smoking violations, a Multnomah County public health inspector visited campus on March 8. The enforcement officer will return unannounced between March 23 and April 22 to re-inspect. Reed will be fined $500 for each violation to the Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act that the officer sees, and up to $4,000 in fines in any 30-day period.

The Oregon Indoor Clean Air Act mandates that most indoor workplaces be smoke-free and prohibits smoking within 10 feet of doors, windows, and air intake vents. The complaints that the Multnomah County Health Department received indicated that people were smoking inside on campus.

Director of Community Safety Gary Granger says that he may need to move faster in implementing change in smoking behavior than he had originally anticipated.

“‘Moving faster,’ for me, Facilities, and Environmental Health and Safety could mean more signs, more engagement by CSOs, moving ash trays and butt receptacles, and re-evaluating waiting out the semester to put in smoke detectors,” Granger says.

Granger also notes that Vice President and Treasurer Ed McFarlane “has made it clear that he believes fines for violations in student run spaces should be paid with student funds.”

Pool Hall manager Jesse Trujillo ’15 says, “We’re definitely increasing our efforts [to decrease smoking] through different fronts because the proposed fine is honestly something the Pool Hall can’t afford.”

Another Pool Hall manager, Molly Kimball ’16, met with Granger; Director of Student Activities Kristen Holmberg; and Assistant Dean of Student Services for Inclusion, Engagement, and Success Bruce Smith earlier this week to discuss the issue of smoking in the Pool Hall and to create an action plan. Kimball believes that the image of the room itself is the root of the problem, and she plans to purchase new couches and clean up the Pool Hall to improve its appearance.

“I think that people tend to not treat this place with respect because it doesn’t look like a place to treat with respect,” Kimball says. “It looks like a place where you can put out your cigarettes anywhere and spill your drink on the floor.”

Kimball also plans to have a community forum in the Pool Hall in the coming weeks. “Something that’s important is making sure everyone is on the same page,” she says. “A lot of this discourse hasn’t involved everyone.”

For many students, smoking in the Pool Hall is part of campus culture, regardless of state law.

“When I got here, smoking in the Pool Hall wasn’t a problem at all, it was a social norm,” senior Taro Shido says. “If people had a problem with smoking, they’d come and tell you.”

Although state law prohibits smoking inside, Shido says that the way in which the issue has been sprung upon the student body was unexpected. “I wish it had been possible to have a forum where we could all come together and talk about it,” he says.

The issue of smoking in the Pool Hall has been addressed numerous times by Senate, students, and Granger at Senate meetings this year, and Honor Council held a forum in October.

Student Body President Ari Galper does not see the threat of the health inspector as a preferable reason for students to stop smoking. “I’m never a fan of changing conduct because of pressures imposed by an external authority, but I think we have to be realistic in this case,” he says. “If people really can’t stop smoking in the Pool Hall, they can at least not throw their butts on the ground, or can otherwise create the appearance of compliance. I’m in no way condoning smoking in the Pool Hall, but I am saying that, currently, Pool Hall smokers are really not helping their own cause.”

Though Galper says that fines would not be the ideal reason to make changes, in the meantime, the Pool Hall managers are taking the potential penalty of indoor smoking seriously.

“We don’t want to get the school fined and we don’t have money to pay for it,” Pool Hall manager Kevin Schmidt ’14 says.
