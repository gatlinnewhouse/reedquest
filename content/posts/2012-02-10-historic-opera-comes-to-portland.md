Giacomo Puccini’s Madame Butterfly is playing at the Portland Opera on Saturday, February 11<sup>th</sup>. In 1994 it was the fourth most popular opera in the world, beloved for its heartbreaking heroine. However, heartbreak is to opera as squirrels are to Reed: Honestly, you’re surprised when it’s not there.

The fascinating part of Madame Butterfly is the bold sociopolitical statement it makes. Its debut was booed off the stage, partly as a retribution for Puccini’s success but also because he dared to suggest that the colonial powers were wrong. Butterfly, the beautiful Japanese bride of an American lieutenant, renounces her family and religion and waits for three years for her love to return to her. The American, on the other hand, never considered the contract he signed to be worth anything and upon his return to the states found a “real wife.” This commentary on the thoughtless cultural marginalization and flippant abuse of foreign resources was not appreciated by European audiences 100 years ago.

The strength of the set is how it shows the passing of time. Sunrise, midnight, spring, and winter are all obvious even though only two backdrops are employed. The passage of time is crucial, and is obvious immediately. The lieutenant rents his house and marries his bride for 999 years, with both contracts severable at any time. On that note, Butterfly has a melodic feminist rant about the ease of divorce that is particularly fun. The three years that she waits, however, seem longer than any infinite lease.

Puccini’s artistic rebellion remains as powerful as ever, though perspectives have obviously changed. The power dynamics between love and infatuation create remarkable tension as Butterfly and the American sing and celebrate their wedding in the moonlight. Devotion and abandonment, guilt and honor, and many other opposing ideas make the inevitability of the opera as tense as an unpredictable outcome.
