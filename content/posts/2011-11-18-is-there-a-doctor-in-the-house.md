You should wear a hipster-boy sweater!” “You mean a cardigan?”

It may have been tech week for _Midnight_, the latest project of Reed’s student-run Shoestring Theatre, but details for the costumes were far from finalized. Like many projects at Reed, _Midnight_ has been put together by a band of passionate students otherwise engaged with work for classes.

“In high school, everyone’s priority was theater. Obviously, at Reed, everyone’s priority is academics,” explains Jill Evans ‘15, the director of _Midnight_. A prospective theatre major, Evans has previously directed a musical in high school. “We goof off too much,” says Evans of the rehearsals, though she finds that the cast and crew were “much more mature and able to take direction better.”

The informal atmosphere at rehearsals is balanced by the serious tone of the plot. Based on the eponymous episode of famed British television series Doctor Who, _Midnight_ is the story of a group of passengers aboard a shuttle on a foreign planet. When an accident appears to leave one of them possessed, tensions arise between the rest of the passengers as they struggle to make sense of the situation.

Shoestring Theatre had been on a yearlong hiatus when Lisa Henderson ’12 and Alex Smith ’14 decided to adapt _Midnight_ for the stage. After helping to found a local theatre company in her hometown of Arnold, MO over the summer, Henderson was excited to revive Shoestring Theatre on her return to Reed. As producers of Shoestring, she and Smith interviewed potential directors and helped set up auditions. Though their roles as producers are over, they have remained involved in other capacities: Smith is the stage manager, while Henderson plays one of the lead roles.

Smith says that they were looking to produce “shows that people recognize. I don’t want to say mainstream, but more…well-loved.” Doctor Who is a popular series among Reed students, with a concentrated fan base in Tír na nÓg (Old Irish for ‘Land of the Young’), the sci-fi and fantasy themed residence hall. Many cast members are residents of ‘the nÓg,’ including Rich Posert ‘15 as The Doctor. Evans admits that fans of the series might be a little skeptical, but confirms that most people who have found out about the project so far have been enthusiastic.

According to Smith, _Midnight_ was written as a filler episode, so it was easy to adapt it to be accessible to those unfamiliar with Doctor Who. In addition, the limited technical requirements made it possible to put on the show on the proverbial shoestring. One of the biggest difficulties has been finding an appropriate rehearsal and performance space, as the Reed theatre facilities have been unavailable for use.

According to Kathleen Worley, Professor of Theatre, “the building is used from early in the morning until late at night in the service (this semester) of nine classes and four productions,” and that with “two shows, 10 directors and 20 actors currently rehearsing for various classes and productions, the theatre space is in constant use already.”

Many of the cast and crew themselves are involved in the two department shows, _Iphigenia and Other Daughters_ and _Shakuntala: An Indian Fairytale_, making it even more difficult to schedule rehearsals. When their final performance space, a large classroom on the third floor of Eliot Hall, has been unavailable for use, the cast have rehearsed in the living room of Prexy and even in the Tír na nÓg common room.

Undeterred by the logistical setbacks, the Shoestring team are mulling over plans for next semester. According to Henderson, Reedies may be treated to a production of _Rent_ or _Dr. Horrible’s Sing-A-Long Blog_, though these are only two of the pieces they are considering. For now, though, their hands are full with final rehearsals for _Midnight_.

“This is the kind of theatre I love doing,” says Evans. “Not the most serious, and not the most comical. That’s the way life is.”
