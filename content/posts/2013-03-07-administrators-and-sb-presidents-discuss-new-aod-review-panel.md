Around thirty or forty students turned out Wednesday night for a discussion of last semester&#8217;s revisions to the Alcohol and Other Drug Policy. The discussion, hosted by Residence Life, featured dormitory Residence Directors, Director of Community Safety Gary Granger, Dean of Student Services Mike Brody, Student Body President Ari Galper, and former Student Body President Brian Moore, who authored most of the revisions.

The “primary driver” of the new bylaws, said Brody, “was an experiment to deal with low level AOD cases” through mediation. Under the previous arrangement, many cases went through Reed&#8217;s Judicial Board, and, said Brody, “everybody we talked to didn&#8217;t like it.”

That was replaced with an AOD review panel, a separate body tasked with reviewing any AOD cases that required discipline. The policy listed five levels of violation, which progress according to seriousness and number of infractions; higher-level violations receive higher sanctions. Students can still opt out of having their case adjudicated by the review panel in favor of J-Board.

“The federal government requires us to have policy in line with laws,” explained Moore. Reed also has a formal arrangement with the Portland Police Bureau that allows Reed to police its own campus, but, under the agreement, the college’s policy must include sanctions for illegal drug and alcohol use.

“We agree to search the residents we suspect of drug possession,” said Granger, adding, “if we discover a felony drug crime we will call the police,” though he noted “a call does not always result in arrest.”

“I don&#8217;t go around calling the police if I find a few capsules,” said Granger. “They want us to call them for three pounds of pot.”

“We have very little interaction with the police over the AOD,” he said.

Brody emphasized the importance of the amnesty policy, which exempts students who receive or ask for medical attention from any alcohol and other drug sanctions. The policy is designed to avoid discouraging asking for help. “I always write a thank-you note to students who call for help,” said Brody.

Danielle Juncal, Sophomore and Bidwell House Advisor, asked if administrators had noted any changes in students&#8217; behavior since the policy began.

“Fewer posters with my face on it,” joked Granger. He said students have adapted, and that “there were a lot more off-campus parties.”

Two-thirds of AOD violations are given to first-year students, according to Assistant Dean of Students for Residence Life Amy Schuckman. Granger said that 25% of those who receive AOD violations do not receive more than one in the average year, but 5% get more than 3 in an average year.

Brody said he believes Reed has been “garnering positive attention regarding our harm reduction.”

“Reed is being proactive,” he said.
