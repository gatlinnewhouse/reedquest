Students, start saving your nickels. On Sept. 1, fares on TriMet Adult, Honored Citizen, and LIFT tickets increased 5 cents, according to a press release from TriMet.

The cost of Adult and LIFT 1-month passes rose $2, and the price of Honored Citizen passes increased $1.

Fares are typically increased every few years to cover the rising cost of doing business. The last increase occured in September 2008.
