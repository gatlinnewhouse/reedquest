By request of Vice President/Dean of Student Services Mike Brody and in concordance with our mission to educate community members about Honor and the Honor Process, we feel we must inform the student body of a change that has been made to the procedure. Until recently, the traditional procedure for an Honor Case heard by the Judicial Board was that once the Board recommended sanctions against the respondent, the President of the College received the sanctions to alter or to sign into effect. The sanctions were then implemented by Student Services. President Kroger has decided that for all Judicial Board and Sexual Misconduct Board cases, he will delegate the responsibility of deciding upon and signing the sanctions into effect to Mike Brody, the Vice President of the College and the Dean of Student Services. Â Since the Judicial Board Code allows the president to specify a designee to review decisions, this change in procedure is provided for within the Code. President Kroger will still review and sign the decisions on cases that go before the Appeals Board, and parties may still make a final appeal to the President himself after their case has gone through the Appeals Board. If anyone has any questions or would like to discuss the matter further, Honor Council is willing to hear your thoughts during our office hours (Monday-Thursday, 5-6 p.m.) or facilitate a forum on the matter.
