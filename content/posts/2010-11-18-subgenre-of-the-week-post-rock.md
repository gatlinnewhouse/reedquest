As lighting rent the sky, the five members of Giants rushed into the boathouse bearing lamps and guitars. In a tiny building more often used for auctions and American Legion dances, this band, illuminated only by the soft glow of a few old lamps, let loose soaring chord structures that rivaled the storm’s blast; to their music the thunder could only provide punctuation.

Post-rock, with its emphasis on harmony, musical texture and tendency towards expansive, multi-movement pieces, will always remind me of the Great Plains. Though prominent post-rock bands hail from across the globe (including Sigur Rós from Iceland, Godspeed You! Black Emperor from Montreal and Mogwai from Scotland), the dynamic soundscapes these bands craft construct an image of open, empty land that rolls for miles. A friend of mine, who had never seen the stretch of America between the cascades and Chicago, told me that when she listened to Giants she could, for the first time, imagine a world that went on and on without any mountains to fence it in.

Post-rock, music that use rock instruments to create deep textures rather than riffs and power chords, first emerged in the nineties from such bands as My Bloody Valentine, and in Slint’s Spiderland. While artists and listeners alike have argued that the label embraces bands that sound nothing alike (compare the raging vortex of noise that is Mogwai’s “My Father My King” to the electronic minimalism of Tortoise’s Millions Now Living Will Never Die), the term has come to be mostly synonymous with any contemporary rock music that abandons vocal-centered, traditional music structures for soundscapes that build towards tremendous crescendos.

The proliferation of this style has spawned diverse bands. Canadian band Thee Silver Mt. Zion, originally a side project of members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, stands as one of the most overwhelmingly vocal post-rock presentations. This leftist, string-heavy group creates searing songs of hope and loneliness that convey an emotional depth completely absent in most mainstream music. Pelican and the now-defunct Isis pioneered a fusion of metal and post-rock now dubbed post-metal. Rather than evoking a classic guitar palette or riffs, the genre maintains an aesthetic embodied by indecipherable vocals and an obsession with ambient morbidity.

Because of their tremendous length and unconventional style, post-rock tracks are largely unsuitable for radio play and inaccessible to most listeners. A notable exception to this has been Sigur Rós, an Icelandic post-rock band that makes use of gibberish vocals (a fabricated language dubbed “Hopelandic”) that fit the music and function essentially as another instrument. Their “Hoppípolla” has been featured in a number of soundtracks, particularly BBC’s Planet Earth. Explosions in the Sky, a group from Texas, is known for their mini-symphonies and provided the soundtrack to Renn Fayre fireworks a few years ago.

Post-rock demands a mode of listening atypical to most forms of contemporary music; it will never be heard in the Student Union on a Saturday night, and the lack of conventional structure means that the nuances and beauty of this music can easily slip into the background if you’re not attentive.

But if you’re willing, grab one of these albums and spend an hour with nothing but you and the sound. Your ideas of what can be done with a guitar will be changed forever.
