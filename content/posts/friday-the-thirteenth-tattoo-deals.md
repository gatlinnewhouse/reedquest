If you’re reading this, it’s the unluckiest day of the year.

That’s right, Friday the Thirteenth is here, and before sitting down to watch Jason travel from Camp Crystal Lake to Manhattan, space, and both literal and developmental hell, you might want to make a stop at your local tattoo parlor. Permanent physical alterations won’t be limited to Voorhees’ victims if Portland’s flash tattoo and piercing sales have anything to say about it. For the unpunctured, flash tattoos are relatively small, pre-drawn pieces that are offered, unmodified, at discounted prices.

First on our list is _Adorn Body Art_, a female-owned studio that will be celebrating the unfortuitous occasion at both their east (_9217 SW BV-Hills, Portland, OR 97225_) and west (_3941 SE Hawthorne Blvd. Portland, OR 97214_) locations. Their Friday the 13 flash designs (pictured below) will be offered for $31 plus a mandatory $9 minimum tip. If you’re looking for something a bit more impulsive, you can try your hand at spinning Adorn’s Piercing Wheel of Destiny, described by their site as a “Wheel of Fortune but with body parts to pierce.” Each spin is $13 and waives “the normal piercing service fee,” which can run anywhere from $35 to $95. If you’re not happy with your spin’s result, you can spin the wheel again for an additional $13 as many times as you want (all your extra spin money will be donated to the Oregon Humane Society). Tattoos and piercings are available on a strict first come, first serve basis from 12:00–7:30 p.m.. Space is limited, so the earlier you go, the better luck you’ll have. All sale tattoos and piercings are _cash only_.

Next up is _Oddball Tattoo_, located on _2716 S.E. 21ST, PORTLAND, OR_, whose Friday the 13 event will run, like Adorn, on a first come, first serve basis from 12:00–8:00 p.m.. Oddball is offering flash-drawn tattoos priced from _$50 to $150, cash only._

_Euphoria Body Piercing & Tattoo_ will be also celebrating Friday the 13 at its _Vancouver Mall_ and _Lloyd Center Mall_ locations. Their events will run from 10:00 a.m. to closing time, which varies by location. Customers will be sorted into one of three separate lines: one for tattoos, one for piercings, and one for those who pay VIP pricing to skip waiting in the lines for the other two.

_Point of View Studio of Tattooing_, located at _2532 NE Broadway Ave. Portland, OR 97232_, will be offering flash tattoos from 12:00–7:00 p.m., with prices ranging from $40 to $100. Pictured below are some of the options drawn by one of their eight artists, Dyllan.

The last tattoo parlor on our list, and perhaps the most extensive option, is _Skeleton Key Tattoo_, located on _1729 SE Hawthorne Blvd. Portland OR. 97214_. Their Friday the 13 special runs from 11:00 a.m.–10:00 p.m., with _$50_ flash tattoos to be selected from one of the new sheets of designs for 2018 prepared by each artist. The special price of $50 only applies if the tattoo is done _on the arms or legs_. When you enter, the person behind the counter will give you a number designating your place in line. If you’re not in line when your number is called, you’re out of luck, although you’re welcome to pick another number and try again. The last numbers of the day will be called at 9:00 p.m., an hour before the shop closes. Having a number doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get a tattoo, so arriving early is strongly recommended.

Whether or not you decide to take your chances on the Wheel of Destiny, take advantage of these local parlors’ lucky deals to celebrate Friday the 13.
