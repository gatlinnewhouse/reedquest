I published an <a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2011/11/at-a-crossroad/" target="_blank">opinion article</a> in the 10/6 Quest detailing Reed&#8217;s administrative response to sexual assault as represented by their choice of staff members such as <a title="New Dean To Tackle Sexual Assault" href="http://www.reedquest.org/2011/11/new-dean-to-tackle-sexual-assault/" target="_blank">ADSAPR Jyl Shaffer</a>; on 11/17, a Reedie whom I do not recognize published an <a title="An Optimist’s Response To ‘At A Crossroad’" href="http://wp.me/p143KZ-gn" target="_blank">opinion piece</a> which criticized me by name and demanded of me a public response which rescinded or modified my views. I hereby decline. The majority of the attacks consist of misreadings of my opinions. After careful consideration of both articles, I have concluded that these misrepresentations would be best corrected through citation of my own piece, and therefore could have been easily avoided through a more careful reading of my article. I further believe that such misreadings are uncharacteristic of our community&#8217;s academic standards, and therefore do not warrant a response for the sake of public clarity. I do not wish to engage in a tit-for-tat correction and/or attack, as neither the Quest as a publication nor the Reed community as a whole will benefit from such a response. Although I accept a limited authorial responsibility for minor ambiguities in my writing, it is not my duty to correct the misreadings of others in a public forum. I do, however, welcome any Reedies curious about my 10/6 opinion to contact me directly with questions. I feel that such an approach is likely to be honorable, honest, and constructive.
