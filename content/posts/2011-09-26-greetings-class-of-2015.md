Hello, freshmen.  Welcome to Reed! Congratulations on becoming part of our crazy and wonderful school.  Now gather round, and I will share with you some choice words of wisdom about Reed and the mystical process of “becoming a Reedie.”

Your first question may be, “Who are those strange, pale, hunched, and cynical creatures who gave us cheap beer and cigarettes during O-Week?” The simple answer: these are upperclassmen.  You must learn to understand us, for we are your future selves.  We were once bright-eyed and happy-go-lucky freshmen such as you, but Reed has transformed us into what we are now, and it will eventually do the same to you.

You may remember the discussion thread about us on your Facebook group.  Someone posted a link to an article by Zach Weinberg, which certain people perceived as an expression of upperclassman arrogance towards freshmen.  Some railed against upperclassmen “assholes.”  Certain others, however, spoke words of reason in a surprisingly productive conservation.  The truth is, we upperclassmen deserve your respect.  We have been here longer than you, and thus we know much more about classes, professors, and Reed culture than you.  Furthermore, we have been changed by this place, as I mentioned earlier.  Let me describe the broad outline of this transformation.

Many (probably most) of us came here with a strong sense of our self-importance.  We did well in high school, mastering the subjects we cared about, and being accepted to Reed felt like a confirmation of our intelligence and potential.  We were ready for a challenge.  Some of us may have even been similar to “That Guy.”  “That Guy” is a student archetype at Reed that is, like all archetypes, an exaggeration, but that carries an important element of truth.  “That Guy” is the student who came to Reed with a superficial understanding of deconstructionism and the philosophy of Nietzsche but also with an obnoxious tendency to use important-sounding academic terms and jargon to try to prove his superiority.

However, through our time and classes here, we upperclassmen have learned more than macroeconomics, literary theory, morphosyntactic typology, and organic chemistry.  Most of us, in one way or another, have learned some of our limits.  We have learned that there is a limit to how much work we can do and how big a workload we can handle, especially when trying to combine our academics with a social life or love life.  We have also come to realize that our intelligence and skills have their own limits, and perhaps aren’t as great as we once thought.  Reed can truly be a brutal school for those who enter with the strongest tendency to push their own limits.

As a result, many of us have more pessimistic and cynical.  Snark and irony, the forms of humor that accompany this new attitude, make up the mask that Zach so effectively adopted for his article about freshmen.

Although we upperclassmen can seem scary at times, you can make friends with us if you follow a few simple rules of etiquette.  The first rule is: Never complain about your work in front of an upperclassman.  It may seem like difficult work or a large workload to you, but you will not know true work until later in your Reed years.  For the second rule, always be respectful when an upperclassman complains about her or his work, especially a senior.  We tend to know what we’re talking about.  Our (admittedly unjust) stereotype of freshmen is that they are full of themselves and have too much time on our hands – when possible, try not to reinforce this image.  The third rule is: DON’T MAKE NOISE IN THE LIBRARY.  Seriously.  The silence of the library is sacred.

(A quick reminder to upperclassmen who are reading along: Remember to respect freshmen and treat them as individuals.  Also, remember that you were once a freshman yourself.)

The best way to approach us is to ask us questions.  We can be valuable resources for you about classes, professors, majors, extracurricular stuff, and so on, although we all have our own biases.  And while interacting with upperclassmen may be difficult at first, it will become easier as you adapt to classes at Reed, participate in our traditions, and adjust to social life on campus.  Eventually, there will be freshmen whose respect you will deserve, and whom you will be able to impress with the stories of your escapades.  We will come to accept you as one of us.

But above all, welcome to Reed and best of luck to you.  Remember to take your classes seriously, but not _too_ seriously.  The adventure upon which you are beginning to embark will be fun, challenging, and crazy in all sorts of unexpected ways.
