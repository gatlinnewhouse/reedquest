We approach to the illegal use of alcohol and other drugs (AOD) within our community’s as a health issue. Punitive responses, while they have their place in discussions about AOD use in the community, are not our first response. The Student Services response starts with education through dialogue, discussion, debate, and a variety of programming modes. As our approach places community health and wellbeing at its core, we feel that it is necessary to engage the community in meaningful encounters that allow for a collaborative construction of community norms and expectations.

Student Services recognizes that there are important questions that have to be answered as we commit ourselves to this health and well being approach – questions that need be answered by individual community members, including staff. Whom do you care about? About whom do you have concerns? How do you show that care and concern? How do our policies, practices, and procedures show that same care and concern?  Answering these questions reveals the type of community we aspire to create.

This student development approach can be characterized as aspirational engagement – we aspire to effect growth, development, and adaptive change for all of our community members, certainly regarding AOD-related behaviors. Aspirational engagement creates opportunity for reflection, assumes that we all have the capacity to grow, and makes space for discussions of the ways our individual behaviors impact the greater community.  Aspirational engagement at Reed is a community process – it includes community members from all walks of life looking out for one another, challenging one another, and engaging one another.

As we engage community members regarding the use of alcohol and other drugs and the college’s Drug and Alcohol Policy, we are guided by this student development approach. It is our goal to develop opportunities for students to learn about themselves and the world they navigate, to help students develop the skills and tools necessary to navigate that world without experiencing undue seasickness, and to better understand the ways that they impact that world.

In our community, at least over the last few years, navigating the murky waters of the Drug and Alcohol Policy and the college’s response to violations of said policy have presented a definite challenge. A wide spectrum of community members has engaged in debate and dialogue about Honor, policy, and their intersection. These are important conversations, and Student Services will continue to work with Honor Council to develop multiple opportunities for community members to share their thoughts in safe, respectful, and adaptive environments. The honor talks offered by faculty and other members of the Reed community will continue. And though these talks will not necessarily focus strictly on AOD, they will definitely contribute to our understanding of the ways AOD engagement impacts all of us.

Student Services, through Residence Life and other departments, seeks to develop a residential education program regarding AOD, life balance, and health and wellness.  Community members can expect to find programs and events in and around the residence halls that address a variety of topics, including managing stress, healthy choices for stress relief, healthy eating for on campus residents, and healthy living in the residence community.

As health and wellness are primary priorities in Student Services’ direction and vision for engaging our community’s AOD problems, the Health and Counseling Center plays a vital role in our educational efforts. At the HCC, community members can find assistance in developing methods to alleviate stress as well strategies to manage stressful situations.  If you haven’t tried the Mind Spa, you need to find your way there. Right now. The HCC’s health and wellness programming includes something for all members of the community, and the Peer Health Advocates provide models of healthy and balanced ways to navigate Reed as well as programming and events that speak to the multitude of student perspectives.

We seek to educate the community not only regarding the college’s drug and alcohol policy and response to AOD violations, but also regarding health, wellness, and the possibilities of balanced lifestyles at Reed. As we continue to develop our modes of student engagement, programming, and events, we expect that community members will be critical and thus assist us in our growth.
