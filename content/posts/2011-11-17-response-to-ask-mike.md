Mike: In last week’s segment of _Ask Mike!_, you responded to a question concerning the lack of participation in student government and Senate’s role in increasing said participation. In your response, you stated, “I don’t think it’s really on Senate or any other distinct group [to increase participation] so much as it is the responsibility of the entire community to establish and communicate a clear expectation that students get and stay involved.” While I agree with much of this statement—particularly the plea that all of us encourage one another to “get and stay involved”—I disagree with your claim that the Senate is free from the responsibility of working to improve the level of participation in student government. In fact, I would argue that improving participation should be a high priority for the Senate, as well as for all other student groups.

I think we both know that one of the primary reasons Reedies are not involved is the simple fact that Reedies are busy. We spend a majority of our time studying and preparing for classes, and any additional time we have free is, rightfully, spent with friends, at PE, on Gray Fund trips, or working with our own student groups. Reed is a demanding school, and we prefer it that way. Because it is so demanding, however, I believe it is unreasonable for the Senate to claim they are fairly representing us and our interests without putting a serious effort into letting us know _how_ they are representing us and our interests. Not that we need reminding, but the Senate is an elected student group, paid from our tuition fees to make very important decisions for the student body. With a student body that is so busy and that has so many responsibilities, it seems wholly irresponsible of the Senate to claim that their decisions represent our interests when they fail to put in adequate effort to get us involved.

I do not mean to say that we (the student body) stand blameless on this issue. We have not shown the Senate that we care about what they do, and perhaps many of us don’t care about what the Senate does. Yet could this problem not be ameliorated, at least in part, if the Senate reached out to the student body—even a little bit? If they had the many important subcommittees on the Senate send out actual reports that we, the students, could read through—instead of letting us find out about what they do only through the Senate Beat (a spark-notes of Senate meetings that gives little life to the governing body) and the SU meeting (an affair that is not at all well-publicized)—couldn’t this make the student body more _aware_ of what the Senate is doing and even more interested in getting _involved_ in the Senate? Wouldn’t this allow the Senate to actually, sincerely, _represent_ us? If, instead of having an overly complicated, text-heavy webpage, they put effort into revamping their website to make it more user-friendly, couldn’t that possibly increase student awareness of Senate procedures and events? For example, how many people knew that Fire On The Quad took place last week? Or, how many people know that Senate elections are coming up? The lack of publicity for both last week’s event and the elections exemplifies the need for such investments as an interactive and updated website. In fact, having a salient website _whatsoever_ could even make student participation in Senate improve (here’s a game: who knows the URL for getting onto the Senate webpage…)!

I realize that I have given more than a few recommendations to the Senate, yet I do not think that any of these requests are unreasonable. While it is undoubtedly the case that the Senators have lots of work to deal with already, shouldn’t making their body more representative be a top priority? Shouldn’t opening up opportunities for students to get involved be important to them?

I must say, Mike, that I have really appreciated your segment in _The Quest_ this past year. It is great to see Reed’s administrators engaging the student body and living up to the high standards we hold you to. I tell all the visitors I meet on campus that any Reed student can have an honest, frank conversation with anyone at Reed, from a fellow peer to the Dean of Student Services, and your segment proves that every week.

With this in mind, then, I hope you will reconsider your position on the need for the Senate to take a role in increasing student participation at Reed. Through several easy steps, I think we can have a student government that is both more representative and, consequently, is one that we care more about.
