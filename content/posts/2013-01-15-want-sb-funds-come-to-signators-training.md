If you&#8217;ve ever sat and looked at some perplexing student-built structure, listened to a band in Winch, graced the MLLL with your presence, eaten free BBQ on the Quad, and/or gone to Renn Fayre, you have witnessed what preposterously cool shit can take place when students get motivated and make things happen.

<div>
  We in the Senate and Treasury work to make sure that people who have good ideas for making rad stuff happen are able to make rad stuff happen by funding organizations, projects, events, and llamas that are beneficial to the Student Body.
</div>

</div>

<div>
  If you want funding for your new or old organization, or simply want some cash for an individual event/project, you have to come to Signators&#8217; Training, so read on!

  <b>Schedule:</b>
</h4>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">
  Signators&#8217; Training: January 30th, 6PM or January 31st, 8PM in Vollum Lecture Hall <b>MANDATORY</b>
</h6>

<div>
  <i>Why should I care?</i> If you want to make your mark on Reed with a 40 ft. tall phallus that pulses and glows in the night and want money to build it with, you <i>must</i> come to Signators&#8217; Training. If you want to spend $3 of Student Body funds on one box of cookies and leave it in the Quad for prospies to fight over, you must come to Signators&#8217; Training. This will teach you how to acquire and properly use money from Senate, and will ready you to navigate the bureaucracy that comes along with $$$. Signators&#8217; Handbooks, aka your funding bible, will be distributed at Signators&#8217; Training.
</div>

<div>
  <b>Note:</b> If you&#8217;re bummed because you can&#8217;t make it to/missed Signators&#8217; Training, don&#8217;t fret! You can still become a signator. Just come by the Treasury&#8217;s office hours (posted on SIN and on our door behind the bong/&#8221;south&#8221; loft of the SU) or set up an appointment by emailing <a href="mailto:&#x6d;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x79;&#x40;&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;">&#x6d;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x79;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;</a> to be trained.

  Preliminary Finance Committees: January 31st, 9PM or February 4th, 8PM Vollum 110
</h6>

<div>
  <i>Why should I care?</i> If you have a superawesome event/project/whatever that <i>has to</i> be funded before Funding Circus/Hell, these are for you. You must already be a signator to be funded, and you are also going to have to submit a budget etc. (find out more at Signators&#8217; Training!) so <i>do not</i> come to the 1/31 session if you were just anointed a signator for the first time this semester.

  <b>Top 40:</b>
</h4>

<div>
  The Top 40 are Reed&#8217;s favorite student body groups, as voted by y&#8217;all. They participate in a special funding process that makes it possible for Senate and the Treasury to allocate student body funds with confidence that we won&#8217;t overdraft the Student Body&#8217;s bank account. (for a more detailed explanation, contact me at <a href="mailto:&#x70;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x73;&#x73;&#x69;&#x63;&#x6b;&#x40;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;">&#x70;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x73;&#x73;&#x69;&#x63;&#x6b;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;</a>)

  <em>Organization Descriptions Due</em>: February 4th, 12:00 PM.<br /> <em>Funding Poll</em>: 12:01 AM on February 5th &#8211; 11:59 PM on February 7th
</h6>

<div>
  Funding Poll is when the entire student body votes for the Top 40 student organizations. Voting will be held on SIN. Watch Student Body Info for more information.
</div>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Budgets Due</em>: 11:59 PM on February 8th
</h6>

<div>
  If your organization is voted Top 40, you must prepare a budget to present at funding circus by 11:59 PM on February 8th. Instructions on how to prepare a budget can be found in your very own Signators&#8217; Handbook.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Funding Circus/Hell</em>: February 9th &#8211; 10th
</h6>

<div>
  Circus is when signators for Student Body organizations present to Senate; Hell is when we try and turn $5 bills into $20s. If your organization is voted Top 40, you will receive your time slot for Circus via email.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Once Funding Circus/Hell is over, any individual or organization can get funding during Finance Committee meetings. Finance committee will be held weekly at a time and place to be determined. More information on finance committee may be found in your signators&#8217; handbook.
