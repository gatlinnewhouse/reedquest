# Repeal of the DACA

This past Tuesday, September 5, President Trump announced that he would be repealing President Obama’s program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). DACA shielded undocumented immigrants (who came to the U.S. as minors) from deportation, in addition to granting them eligibility for American work permits. Studies have shown that DACA increased the incomes for low-income immigrants, as well as the employment rate for those eligible (also known as Dreamers). 

Trump’s executive order would prevent approval of Dreamers’ future applications for ‘parole’ (temporary, renewable amnesty for deportation) under DACA. While the president said that he will not generally take action to remove any Dreamers who are currently protected under DACA, the applications for DACA have to be renewed every two years, meaning that once their protections run out, Dreamers will be left vulnerable to deportation. 

The changes will take place beginning on March 8, 2018, in order to give “Congress the opportunity to consider appropriate legislative solutions.” However, no new DACA applications will be considered after October 5, 2017.

Although President Trump claims that repealing DACA will benefit non-undocumented American workers, a study by the libertarian CATO Institute has found that the repeal would both harm the economy, and present a hefty cost to the U.S. The final result was estimated out to a $60 billion cost after the deportation of all 750,000 Dreamers. Additionally, the repeal would cost our country around $250 billion in lost tax revenue over the next decade. 

# Rising tensions with North Korea

This summer has been an active one for the North Korean military, with 18 missiles having already been fired. These tests seem to be serving the purpose of perfecting the technology, and also as a show of force to the U.S. They have resulted in heightened tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, tensions that have been further exacerbated by President Trump’s antagonistic approach to North Korea’s power displays and assertions that he would rain “fire and fury” down on the country if it threatened the U.S.

According to Gen. Mark Milley, the chief of staff of the U.S. Army, North Korea is “the single most dangerous threat facing the international community right now.”

With the North Korean government’s July announcement that they had finally developed a ballistic missile that could reach the West Coast of the U.S., and perhaps even further east, fears that nuclear missile tests might follow have grown. This is especially in light of North Korea’s September 3 test of their largest nuclear weapon yet, an unprecedentedly powerful hydrogen bomb.

# Transgender military ban 

On August 25, President Trump signed a memorandum preventing the military from moving forward with President Obama’s plan to allow openly transgender people to join the armed forces, citing the “tremendous medical costs and disruption” supposedly caused by the military service of trans people. This statement was debunked by the Rand Corporation’s 2016 study on the cost of trans folks in the military, which was commissioned by the Department of Defense. The study found that, even if every single trans person serving in the military did chose to undergo hormone treatments during their service—a statistically unlikely event—the the cost of paying for these would still be negligible and far short of “tremendous.”

With this directive in place, the only way trans people will be allowed to serve in the military is by concealing their identities. 

It is unclear whether or not this action will prevent trans folks already in the military from continuing to serve. 

# Trump reinstates Cuba embargo

In June, President Trump announced that he would be reversing many of President Obama’s changes to U.S.–Cuban relations. Obama historically upended numerous American sanctions against Cuba that had been in place since the Cold War, creating new economic, diplomatic, and personal travel opportunities for Americans and Cubans alike.

Trump’s actions reversed many of Obama’s policies: travel between the U.S. and Cuba will once again be restricted, as will trade. However, the U.S. will still keep the Obama-established embassy in Havana.

# More troops to Afghanistan

On August 21, President Trump announced a new strategy for the now 16-year war in Afghanistan. He pledged to reduce the focus on building a nation and instead concentrate more on addressing the threat of terrorism. He agreed to a plan that involves the addition of around 50 percent more U.S. troops on Afghan soil. In his speech, Trump also pressured Pakistan and India to contribute more to the U.S. action in Afghanistan through curbing terrorism within their borders and providing economic support. The plan was rather vague, however, with few specifics laid out.
