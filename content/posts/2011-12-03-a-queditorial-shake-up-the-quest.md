As you may or may not be aware, only two of my colleagues, Alex Blum and Alex “Sketchy” Walker will be on next semester&#8217;s Quest Board. They will be joined by some of our friends from the freshman class, and I have great confidence that they will continue working to make this a great paper. Why are the other six of us calling it quits?

Well, writing the Quest is a damn hard job. We’ve realized, in the course of the semester, that this is partially due to the institutional framework (or lack thereof) around the Quest. Briefly, four major problems we’ve identified with the Quest:

1. No institutional support.

2. Little incentive to do the job.

3. No continuity between boards.

4. The system of selecting the Quest Board—namely, elections.

We&#8217;d probably be laughed at if we suggested that 1 and 2 are ever going to change. On the other hand, there&#8217;s a lot that can be done, I think, about 3 and 4, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve talked about the most. Conveniently, I think they go hand in hand.

Here&#8217;s the short version of how we got to be your Quest Board: Twelve people decided writing the Quest was a thing we could do. I&#8217;m not sure how many our opponents in the election had, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as many. So guess what happened? The bigger board won, because we collectively had more friends.

After we won the election, we basically had to figure out from scratch, as had our predecessors, how to manage a newspaper. The lack of institutional continuity means that new Quest Boards are essentially made to reinvent the wheel and figure out for themselves skills that could much more easily have been taught to them.

This is a stupid system. The Quest is run this way because it was once believed that electing the board would make it more democratic. There are several things wrong with this, but the main one is this: Who in the hell decided that a newspaper should be run democratically? It&#8217;s not a political position. It requires a specific set of skills. There is no reason that the only requirement for the position of Quest Editor be “whoever has the most friends.”

Another problem is that since Quest Boards are elected in groups means, you can end up with a board that&#8217;s way too small to be effective. This has been an issue with many of our predecessors. Most everyone at Reed is probably capable of putting together a decent newspaper; it&#8217;s just that three people can only do so much.

All that said, we&#8217;ve come up with a few possible solutions, some major and some less so.

The first one constitutes a fairly minor change: Leave Quest Board an elected position, but require all candidates to have written two or three articles before being eligible to run. This would at least ensure that people have an idea what they&#8217;re getting into, and that they have some basic journalism skills.

Another idea, hopefully in conjunction with some of the other ones, is to create certain positions that are appointed separately. We already have two such positions: ad manager and business manager. We would simply be expanding this to include layout (the editor in charge of graphic design of the paper), and possibly copy editor. It doesn&#8217;t really make a whole lot of sense to have the Quest Board proper be in charge of layout. It&#8217;s a very different skill from writing and editing, and making it a separate position would free up the entire board to work on actual journalism. Copy editing, too, is a different skill from writing and is vital to the quality of the publication.

Third, we believe that the Quest should be funded by a line item instead of through funding poll. That&#8217;s where Senate&#8217;s salaries ****and funding for things like the Student Body Handbook come from, and basically it would mean that the Quest would always get paid a certain amount every semester. This seems like a no-brainer to me. The paper costs a certain amount to print, period. Having it go through funding poll means that Senate could theoretically cut our funding off if we ever offended them—and this is supposed to be a democratic system for running a newspaper?

The final option we&#8217;ve come up with is to make it an appointed position. We&#8217;re aware this might be controversial. The heart of the issue, to me, is that the Quest Board is not a political position, and it shouldn&#8217;t be treated like one. J-Board and Honor Council don&#8217;t have the problems of continuity and numbers that we do, because they&#8217;re appointed one member at a time and never have an entirely new group.

The inevitable issue with appointing the Quest Board, of course, is the question of who would do it. It could either go through Appointments Committee like every other non-government position in the student body, or it could be internally appointed. Either way, we would have a set number of editors, and the term would be a year, with new members appointed every semester. That way there would always be experienced members around to teach the incoming members how things work.

If you&#8217;re concerned about bias or nepotism with appointments, all I have to say is that the current system isn&#8217;t working. The Quest has historically had a poor reputation on campus, but as I&#8217;ve tried to make clear, we believe this can change. Reedies are smart people. There&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t write a newspaper, except that our philosophy on self-governance has left us with a bizarre and ineffective organizational structure. Something has to change if the Quest is going to improve in the long term.

If you have thoughts, ideas, complaints, or profanity-filled rants about this, please write to us at  c<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x71;&#x75;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;</span>**.** Seriously, PLEASE tell us what you think. We want to involve the whole student body in this process. The Quest belongs to all of us at Reed and we need your feedback as we work to change things.
