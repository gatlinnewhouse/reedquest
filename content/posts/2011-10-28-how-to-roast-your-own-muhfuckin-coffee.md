You spend too much money on coffee. Yes, you. I’ve seen you, getting your early morning jolt from Commons, stopping by the fucking Paradox between classes, and topping it off with a fucking no-soy caramel macchiato from Starbucks. I bet you thought that this was just the way your fucking life was going to have to be forever.

But what if there was another way, a way that not only tasted better, but was cheaper, and, strangely, fucking fun too? What if you could roast your own coffee?

Well, in case you didn’t figure it out from the title of the article, you can. All you need is a stove, a fucking Whirley-pop popper ($30 from Amazon), a metal bowl and colander ($8 at BiMart) and a deep fry thermometer ($5 at cash and carry). You also need some fucking green coffee, which costs about six fucking dollars a pound. I would recommend buying it from Mr. Green Beans, since the guy there is super fucking friendly and helpful, even though their fucking prices are a bit high. Also, you can buy green coffee online. I recommend fucking Brazil coffees because they&#8217;re cheap and fucking flexible.

So, now that you have your materials, let’s get to the dirty fucking business of coffee roasting. If you’re in a dorm common room, open all the fucking windows. This shit gets smoky. Wedge the fucking thermometer into one of the little spaces on either end of the Whirley-pop handle. Then, heat the stove to medium heat (low on a gas stove) and wait for the thermometer to hit the 450 fucking degree mark. Open the top of the Whirley-pop, toss in about ¾ of a pound of coffee, close the Whirley-pop, and get cranking. Crank the agitator (that&#8217;s a fucking fancy word for the handle) for the remainder of the process (if you don’t, your fucking coffee will SUCK). The temperature will drop to the 275-300 range, and then begin to rise very slowly. After about 8 minutes, you’ll start to hear loud, popping sounds. This is the fucking “first crack”.

This is the tricky part. After the first crack ends, it’s too soon to take your fucking coffee out. But by the second crack, which is more like a fizzling sound and happens at about the sixteen minute mark, your fucking coffee will be pretty dark—verging on a French Roast (that&#8217;s really fucking dark). (After the end of the second crack, wait much longer and your coffee will burn.) I recommend a fourteen minute roast for a medium-dark cup of awesome fucking coffee.

So, once you hit the desired roast color, dump the coffee into the bowl, run the fuck outside with it as smoke starts to rush up from it, lest you set off a smoke alarm. (Pro tip: find an overhang if it’s raining. Getting coffee wet will ruin it) Then transfer your coffee between the bowl and the colander to cool it. (Pro tip: Put your fucking bowl and colander in the freezer before doing this)  Then, use the wind and the colander to your advantage and shake off the chaff, which is just the “skin” of the coffee that has come off during roasting. Don’t do this inside or your floor will get covered in chaff.

Once the coffee is cooled, you’re done! Congrats. Put it in a Tupperware container, label it with a fucking sharpie, and think about how fucking cool and fucking DIY you are.
