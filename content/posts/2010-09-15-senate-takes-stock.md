_Student Organizations Required to Make Inventories_

Student Senate is keeping closer tabs on student organizations this semester. Top 40 groups will be required to compile an inventory of their current possessions before accessing capital improvement funds, said Cori Savaiano, head treasurer of the student body.

“The inventory is designed to see what goes missing,” said Nina Showell, a senator.

Signators will fill out an inventory form for new purchases when they turn in disbursements to the treasury, said Austin Campbell, vice president of the student body.

A list of student body property will be available on SIN, Campbell said. This will enable students to more easily borrow and use the items, and should prevent redundancy.

No plans are currently set for dealing with missing or stolen property, Showell said.

“In terms of current students, we’ll just talk to them. Hopefully under the Honor Principle people won’t [steal],” she said.

Groups that come to Finance Committee for funds will face the same requirements, Campbell said.
