  Twentieth century Chinese history is rife with protest movements, from the May 4 Movement of 1918 and the March 18 Massacre of 1926 to the December 9Movement of 1935, and the Tiananmen Incident of 1976. Then, of course, there was the infamous 1989 Tiananmen Square protests that resulted in martial law being instituted in Beijing. The complex buildup to June 4, 1989, and the Chinese government’s censorship of the event in the aftermath is the subject of history major Elizabeth Olson’s thesis, &#8220;To Rebel is Justified: Generational Dissonance, Historical Revisionism, and the 1989 Beijing Spring,” advised by History professor Douglas Fix.

The image of a lone man delaying the advance of the line of tanks has cemented itself in the world’s consciousness, but “many people growing up in China today don’t know the event happened,” Olson says. She first learned of this ignorance when hosting a Chinese foreign exchange student in high school. “I asked her about Tiananmen, but she knew nothing about it,” Olson says. “I showed her an image of the man and the tanks and she thought it was doctored.” But Elizabeth did not really become involved in the issue until coming to Reed.

“I started learning Chinese at Reed and became a Chinese Literature major,” Olson says, “but after studying in Beijing I found I was much more interested in the history.” She would ask people she met in China about the incident but most had little or no idea what she was talking about. After becoming interested in the Chinese music scene, she moved to the district of the city where that culture was strongest. “People who were into music in Beijing were more likely to talk about it. A guitarist in China got me into the subject. He would have to go out of his way to access information and find out about the event.”

The sociopolitical system in which the students who protested in 1989 grew up in was replete with contradictions. Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms starting in 1978 introduced capitalist, free-market policies and clashed with the socialist policies that had been put in place during the Mao-Era. “Economic insecurity and discontent was particularly strong among academics because university professors were making significantly less money than street vendors,” Olson says. “Another major problem was government jobs through nepotism.” Hu Yaobang, originally promoted by Deng to help guide the economic changes was forced to resign in 1987 when Deng thought he had not dealt with student protests properly. He continued to be popular in the academic community, and it was his death two years later that provided the original impetus for the Tiananmen Protests of 1989.

Her thesis looks at the rhetoric in 1989 for historical references and ideological discussions between students and the government to attempt to understand why the protests escalated to military violence. “Students originally gathered simply to memorialize Hu,” Olson says, “but quickly turned to calls for democracy, economic freedom, anticorruption, and an end to nepotism.”

Other student movements throughout the twentieth century influenced the 1989 movement to a great degree. Both students and governments were attempting to implement strategies learned from the earlier protests that had managed to exact large change. Pressures by the rest of the revolutions going on during 1989 also likely had a large influence in Chinese government choosing to institute martial law. Estimates of those killed run from a few hundred to over a thousand, but the Chinese government continues to deny that anyone other than soldiers died.

‘Tiananmen’ and other probable search words are currently blocked by the Great Firewall, as is the date ‘June 4’ or the search ‘today’ on that date. This past summer, Elizabeth had the opportunity to see the censorship in real-time during an internship in New York working on Chinese human rights issues. She saw activists’ posts and accounts deleted and became more interested in the specifics of institutionalized censorship as it pertains to the Tiananmen protests. “What is the government afraid of?” Olson says. “Multiple governments have been in control and they have all adopted the same policy.”
