**Theresa Swayne ‘91**

Academic life at Reed is strongly flavored by what I call the “stress culture.”

Within the stress culture, social life consists of agonizing aloud and at length about how much work one has to do before an audience of admiring colleagues. A little kvetching here and there is one thing, but in the stress culture the litany of suffering is recited incessantly to the exclusion of other activities, such as actually getting the work in question done.

This may be accompanied by the exclusive wearing of black, a cultivated gaunt and haggard look, and addiction to caffeine and/or nicotine. But this is only a stereotype. In fact, most Reedies succumb to the stress culture at one time or another. Countless hours are spent discussing how hard we are working, usually over coffee somewhere far from where any work is actually occurring. The high holidays of the stress culture are reading week, finals week, and thesis day. Its acolytes are freshlings in the throes of a Hum paper; its novitiates are those taking the junior qual or, perhaps, organic chemistry; its adored saints are seniors in labor with the T-word.

The difference between healthy commiseration and the stress culture is the competitive attitude. Many of us were stars back in high school and still need to feel as if no one else could truly comprehend the burden of wielding so much intellectual power. A kind of machismo thereby seeps into Reed culture. How close to burnout can you go without crashing?

Furthermore, the possibility of making a more captivating story is an incentive to accumulate problems we did not originally have. Thus, the stress culture fosters unnecessary pressures and simply makes people unhappier than they need to be.

The competitive studier is like a gym addict who obsessively tries to lift more and more weight on principle. Insecure bodybuilders take steroids; Reedies drink double espressos. Pushing too hard is risky in either case: pulled muscles or slipped discs result in the one, a kind of mental paralysis in the other.

So if the stress culture is so counterproductive, why do we join in? It can seem the easiest way to cope. First, the macho stressed-out narrative is easy to construct, because it requires neither activity nor creativity. We simply elaborate on our very real academic stresses. Second, in my experience, intelligent and observant people are predisposed to anticipate the worst, and worry about it until it comes. Finally, avoiding a task automatically ensures we won’t fail at it. (Since our failure would naturally consume the world in a fiery ball, we will not discuss it further.)

As a bonus, non-academic stresses may be buried under a mountain of academic work, or disguised for rhetorical purposes as still work work-related stress. Thus one’s reputation as super-Reedie is secured.

**Treatment of Academic Stress**

Passive horror at your situation may feel like an efficient coping strategy at the moment, but with continued stress it inevitably turns into depression. Wallowing in anxious perfectionism is more interesting, but equally unproductive. One of my Reed profs referred to this condition most memorably as “mental masturbation.”

Unfortunately, it lacks the benefits of the physical kind. I offer some alternative home remedies below.

Begin by realizing that you are a student and your job is to learn here. Equally, you are a human being, which means you like to and need to do things other than studying. Academic stress becomes harmful when it prevents you from doing either of these jobs well.

Practically speaking, if you find yourself behind in your work, the worst thing you could do is study all the time. It’s impossible to get back on an even keel wen you are enacting a drama of self-punishment that saps all your usable energy. The second worst thing, predictably, is to stop studying altogether.

Instead, try to verbalize what exactly is freaking you out: “I don’t have enough time to do this lab report well.” “If I can’t know everything there is to know about Nietzsche, I might as well quit school right now.” “I couldn’t think of anything to say in conference today so the Prof thinks I’m an idiot and now I won’t get a good recommendation for grad school so I’ll have to become a [ditch-digger/investment banker].” Unnamed things are scarier than named ones. Distinguish, if you can, etween the material facts and your emotional reactions or imaginative extrapolations. Finally, see whether the verbalized, named stress really warrants utter misery.

Now that you have enumerated your fears and discontents, you can calmly divide and conquer. Classic stress culturites are under-stimulated doing just one thing at a time, so they end up doing it all halfway and poorly. A better approach when you’re on the edge of despair is to focus on one task and whittle away, as slowly as you need to. If you can persuade yourself to do one thing everyday like get up for breakfast, write one page of a paper, or read ten pages, you really have one the battle. Every small success makes you feel better, and you will rediscover your ability to accomplish things.

Occasionally, sanity and proportion may require you to subvert your natural perfectionism. Even very fine works of art, science, or scholarship rarely feel “finished” to their creators. This sounds terrible, but you simply can’t apply 100 percent of your attention and brainpower to every assignment in a semester.

Develop an instinct for knowing when to settle for 80 percent. If you are considering asking for an extension on an assignment, seriously judge whether the extra time will produce a worthwhile and necessary improvement in the product.

Keep in mind that you are not ordinary. In fact, as people go, you are pretty damn smart, and you should feel good about that. If you have trouble remembering this, watch a typical hour of TV.

**Prevention of Academic Stress**

First of all, eat and sleep properly. It’s stupid to deny yourself that. Also, exercise a few times a week if possible. You can sweat out some of that stress and get P.E. credit for it.

Realize that work cannot be your whole existence. Human being are generalists and need different typed of stimulation. If your work isn’t getting done because it isn’t fun anymore, and you can’t remember why you ever thought it would be fun, they you probably need to spend an hour a day doing something else.

Develop a non-self-destructive social life. Too many Reedies deny themselves the pleasures of community service, sports, music, and everything off campus.

There are a few more study skills that I have found useful in the darkest hours (literally and figuratively) of my academic career.

Take advantage of your professors, who have dedicated themselves to helping you traverse the jungle of academia. Check in with each of your profs during office hours at least once or twice a quarter. If you are shy and easily embarrassed like I am, you may have to drag yourself there on the pretext of a semi-trivial question, but you will leave with a truer perspective on how you’re doing.

Do something every night for every class. Read over your notes right before the next class. Take 10-minute breaks while studying. Set aside time to play each week and don’t postpone it out of guilt. Sit sometimes and do nothing, and don’t think about work. Just see, hear, smell, feel the material world. My favorite place to do this is the Canyon. Remember how it feels to just be. It is the prerequisite to everything else we do.
