_Every week, The Quest will be profiling the thesis of one senior whose work is worth sharing with the Reed community. The purpose of this column is to increase awareness among Reedies of the work being done by people in various academic fields and to make disparate forms of scholarship accessible and understandable to all._

When most people think of public school segregation in America, they tend to recall images of The Little Rock Nine, or the momentous Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education. But for Maya Edelstein &#8217;11, of Port Jefferson, New York, the topic of school segregation extends to another issue—one of which many Americans may never have heard.

    Maya Edelstein '11 sees the human side of immigration.

In October of 1906, the San Francisco city school board passed a resolution mandating that Japanese students attend separate public schools from non-Asian Americans. Maya&#8217;s spring-fall History thesis, “From School Segregation to the Gentlemen&#8217;s Agreement: Japanese Immigrants and U.S. Citizenship,” contextualizes this occurrence in the racial politics of turn-of-the-century America and examines the unexpectedly large repercussions it had on international relations and American domestic policy.

> “In 1906, the San Francisco city school board passed a resolution segregating Japanese students from public schools.”

“There was a confluence of factors at play,” says Maya of the background of the policy. Although San Francisco integrated African-American and white students, Chinese students were already segregated. San Francisco was at the time governed by the Union Labor Party, which was “one of the most vocal opponents to immigration” of the period. Born of a fear of competition from immigrants for paying work, Maya says, the party&#8217;s platform was part of a “tradition of anti-Asian sentiment” not too different from the xenophobia seen in American society today: their ideas, she explains, were “similar to the kind of rhetoric you hear today about Mexican workers.” These sentiments found a chance to manifest themselves when an earthquake struck in April of 1906, destroying many of the city&#8217;s schools. “Shuffling students around,” as Maya puts it, didn&#8217;t seem to the School Board like it would create as much of a conflict “when there was a sense of starting from scratch.”

The policy also had much wider effects than were initially intended, eventually culminating in President Theodore Roosevelt taking direct action to reverse it. Even though the school board&#8217;s action was a very local order—“not even a law,” says Maya—that only affected a total of 93 Japanese students, “right away, it was a diplomatic incident.” The Japanese press focused on the story, and then subsequently began producing wider reports of the conditions Japanese immigrants faced on the West coast. It became such a well-publicized story in Japan that Roosevelt heard of the policy for the first time from the American ambassador to Japan, rather than from a domestic source. He eventually asked for a reversal of the policy in order to normalize relations with Japan, but, Maya says, a “permanent change” had taken place in the two countries&#8217; relations, which culminated with 1907&#8217;s Gentlemen&#8217;s Agreement, which culled Japanese immigration to America. Many historians, according to Maya, have preferred to look primarily at Roosevelt&#8217;s role in the conflict, rather than portraying the full range of events that led to the international controversy. “In a story like this, it&#8217;s easy to focus on the president,” she explains. “The central challenge for me with this thesis is to write about what began as a very local garden-variety piece of legislation that really grew in terms of the attention it received.”

Maya says she has taken to heart the mantra of her advisor, Jackie Dirks: “Think your way back into the past.” The parties of the 1906 conflict grappled with a “complicated issue of race, nationality, and citizenship,” she says, that is still alive today: “At every point in American history,” she says, immigrants “have challenged the ways Americans think about race.” To Maya, these questions represent more than an abstract exercise in thinking: “Law affects the way someone lives,” she says. “Immigration always seemed to me like a problem with a very human side.”
