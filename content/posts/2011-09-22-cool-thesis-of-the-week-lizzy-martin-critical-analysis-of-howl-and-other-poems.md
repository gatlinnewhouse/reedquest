_Each week, The Quest profiles the thesis of one senior whose work is worth sharing with the Reed community. The purpose of this column is to increase awareness among Reedies of the work being done in various academic fields and to make disparate forms of scholarship accessible and understandable to all._

At the beginning, “the entire room stopped. By the end, people started flipping out&#8230;This had never been done before.”

    Lizzy Martin '11 wants to honor the memory of her literary hero.
  </p>
</div>

This is how Lizzy Martin describes the first time poet Allen Ginsberg read his revolutionary work “Howl” at the Six Gallery in San Francisco in 1955. This poem, along with the others in Ginsberg&#8217;s 1956 collection “Howl and Other Poems,” is the subject of Lizzy&#8217;s as-yet untitled English thesis. She says her thesis, which will provide a critical analysis of all of the 11 poems in context with one another, will be “the first close reading&#8230;of this collection in its entirety.”

That the collection has received little serious criticism, says Lizzy, is surprising given the notoriety “Howl” has achieved. The Beat poetry movement—of which Ginsberg&#8217;s work was a central part—dealt with taboo topics and eschewed conventional literary technique. Thus, it was highly controversial for its time, and because of this, Lizzy explains,  the Beat generation “was seen as a counterculture movement instead of a literary movement.” “Howl,” therefore, “hasn&#8217;t been studied as a piece of art&#8230;just as a piece of culture.” The poem was “too painful,” she says, “too human to be this artistic thing you can look at in a critical way.” However, Lizzy believes that being different from what has come before should not discount something as art: To anyone who would criticize a work, for example, for not conforming to a certain metrical layout, she advises: “It&#8217;s not supposed to have that metrical layout, so calm the fuck down.”

Instead, Lizzy would prefer to focus on what&#8217;s great about Ginsberg&#8217;s work. “That in 57 pages, he could summarize the pains of people who were left out of culture&#8230;is so amazing.” The controversial elements of Ginsberg&#8217;s poetry, she goes on, are an integral part of what makes it what it is. “Spirituality and sexuality play a role in each of the poems,” she says, and Ginsberg&#8217;s use of obscenity is “actually really aesthetically pleasing.” To Lizzy, the fundamentality of Ginsberg&#8217;s subject matter, which some may consider base, gives his work a transcendental nature: “Even if you don&#8217;t get all the references,” she explains, “the imagery is so powerful.” This “visceral” effect makes Ginsberg&#8217;s work hard to pigeonhole. Ultimately, Lizzy says, it is “uplifting, but also really tragic.”

When she first heard “Howl” in high school, Lizzy says, “it grabbed me in the way it&#8217;s grabbed so many people,” and ever since then, she says, it&#8217;s held a special place for her. She has had her copy of “Howl and Other Poems”—the same one she has today—since the summer after her junior year of high school, and she says it has “tagged along on all my adventures in my bag.” A personal connection to Ginsberg, Lizzy points out, is something that all Reedies have, even if they don&#8217;t know it: The first recorded reading of “Howl” was done by Ginsberg in Reed&#8217;s own Anna Mann dorm. Lizzy says that when she first held the original recording (which is on reserve in the Special Collections in Hauser Library&#8217;s basement), she “cried a little bit.” The connection to Reed, she goes on, has “made it a lot more significant” to study Ginsberg&#8217;s poetry, and Lizzy says she still feels his presence on the campus. “I know for sure that he walked on the same steps that I&#8217;m walking on,” she says.

Given the importance of Ginsberg’s work to Lizzy, she says it is a shame that he hasn&#8217;t received the attention as an artist that he deserves. Ginsberg has become “part of the canon, but as a personality, not as an artist,” she says, “and I want to change that.” To spend her senior year writing a thesis to “honor his memory,” Lizzy says, is “the least I could do for him.” “I feel like I have to do this for him,” she concludes, “because he has done so much for modern poetry, American art, and the countless people who have read any of his poems and felt something—anything!—like me.”
