SO. Who wants to hear about how I was conceived?!  It was not, unfortunately, anything close to my current reality. There was no Prosecco, no shit ton of reading due tomorrow, no temporary Einstein tattoos on inebriated contributor (OH MAH GAH WILL THEY CENSOR THIS? Honor Conundrum – speaking of which, Ellen Millender is the bomb even if she didn’t give a “lecture”), no youthful exuberance for the bright future ahead of my parents – instead my friends, my dear, dear friends, I was conceived in a Marriott Courtyard Hotel**<sup>®</sup>** in PARTY CENTRAL, AMERICA. Because they were seriously cool and got rowdy. Perhaps not. To some commonfolk, Party Central is known as Toledo, Ohio.

Let me elucidate (awesome word. Y’know what else is an awesome word? Apoplectic. Solid word. Go Quest).  Toledo, Ohio is a magical land known for its glass and auto industry, as well as its local sports teams. I researched that. I should totes be a reporter ‘cause I’m so thorough. It’s fucking cold there, apparently, and there was also a quick scuffle between the ohio-boring-folk and the Michigan-capitalistic-folk over the territory in the Toledo War in the mid-1800s. No Shitting. I’m important. There was a war. Where I was conceived. ANYWAYS.

The ‘rent were super prepped to shoot out a narcissistically-edifying clone of themselves and my moms ovaries were ripe as a tropical mango.  She’d been working her ass off in Med School and she figured popping out a very loud manifestation of pure need would be a stellar way to relax. BU T ALAS OVULATING IS HARD and there was only a slight window of time in which she and my dad could get it on, go through the totally chill process of PREGNANCY and then shove a few pounds of flesh out of her vagina before she had to write her fucking thesis. You see where my Reedie-ism comes in.  Timing was gonna be tough.

And again, ALAS, my dad was off being a douchey and entitled Architecture student, spoiler: drama, the EXACT period of what would be my ovulation, as he had to take a quest to the desolate fields of suburban Toledo for a conference on the Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference, Toledo, Ohio, June 21-25, 1992 (Google rocks my world. This is emotionally significant). What I love about this story is the actually medicinal level of suspense (another spoiler: I GET FUCKING BORN).

Thus and merrily and merrily thus, my parents being the raunchy sexpots that they were – are? I leave that to the OpEd – empiricized my birth. Again, no shit. There was a schedule. My mom flew from New Haven to Toledo and cloistered herself in what I’m sure was a grainy, taupe, and nauseatingly placid room in our dear Marriott to be ravaged by my dad. Productively. Wow, that happened. I have to affirm my belief in the power of our sex (The female-gendered one, which is awesome. The best, even.) because this level of objectification is offensive even in this condition. Which is an awesome condition. Yeah.  SO MY dad would go to this conference for an hour at a time, then borrow the school van and make roadkill on the way back to the Marriott so he could, y’know, make me, and then Speed Racer his way back for the next fucking lecture. And then back to the Marriott across the golden plains. Eventually his advisor deduced that his bathroom breaks were systematic and would just smile as my father asked for the keys to the van. I hope he enjoyed that. Maybe I don’t.

This went on for two days. What I imagine were two stunning, sunlight-mote-filled, really, really satisfying days.

Then mi madre went back to school, and yipeeki-ay I was conceived with Steve Black-ian science.  I wore a mini graduation cap to her ceremony. Here’s the kicker: If I had been born a boy, I was going to be named Toledo Max.
