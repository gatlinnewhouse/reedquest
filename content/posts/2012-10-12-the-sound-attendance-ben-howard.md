Concert Review: **Ben Howard**: Wonder Ballroom: October 4  [ACOUSTIC ROCK]

Ben Howard plays a familiar type of folk that can seem mine dry and overworked or delicate and heartwarming depending on who you’re talking to. He represents the kind of musician that perfected the combination of technical skill and sincere songwriting that many guitarists seek like a golden calf. Perhaps what managed to pack the dim-lit, and barn-like Wonder Ballroom to a significant level of griminess most is Howard’s emotional and melodic schemes, which can be relied on to build tension that explodes in crashing, fast-strumming peaks.

Howard was cutesy during the set, asking for cheers from the ‘drinkers’ and the ‘non-drinkers’ in the crowd, and joking about the ‘practical’ gift of a capo someone had chucked at him; which he proceeded to play with. Howard also seemed taken aback by the enthusiasm of crowd goers, who shrieked like he was a backstreet boy and cuddled with intensity during the many romantic songs. In some ways it’s almost refreshing to attend a show where people tend to be overtly appreciative of the artist as opposed to the pouty and uncommitted vibe of indie shows, which I’ve largely experienced in Portland. Give his 2011 _Every Kingdom_ a listen is the earthy and emotive acoustic sound can grow on you.
