MusicfestNW, billed as “Portland&#8217;s largest and most successful music festival,” ran from last Wednesday to Sunday. With more than 170 bands in 18 venues that are sprinkled across the city, the festival offered something for everyone. There were popular acts and bands that even the most seasoned music veteran would likely be unable to identify.

Variety, in this case, was a wonderful thing, providing innumerous possibilities for a festival-goer throughout the five-day duration of the festival. In a single day, a festival-goer could start the day at Portland Courthouse Square with The Antlers and wind down with Big Freedia at the Heineken Stage in the late hours of the night. It would have been entirely possible for an especially ambitious festival-goer to fit seven acts in one day. The sheer amount of music in this festival was simply overwhelming: it could even have been too much for the easily fatigued festival-goer. Thankfully, MusicfestNW was forward-thinking enough to spare those under the age of 21 from all this busyness by excluding them from many of the venues. In fact, those who are so blessed to be underage were limited to half of the 18 venues.

Geography also limited the ability to see specific bands as the venues are spread apart in such a way that it is hugely inconvenient to travel from one venue to the next. Attendees to next year&#8217;s festival may want to consider bringing along a bike, as parking can often be a challenge that will almost certainly end in a trip to the closest parking structure and a long walk to the venue. For those who have responsibilities and are unable to spend long hours on obscure music blogs, Pioneer Courthouse Square was an ideal place to stay for the duration of the festival. More popular bands like Explosions in the Sky, Iron and Wine, Band of Horses, and The Antlers held the stage from four to around nine, so many late night festival-goers preferred to branch out to the smaller venues. Of particular note were the burly-looking “beverage monitors” at Pioneer Courthouse Square, who will without so much as a “How do you do” snatch beverages out of the hands of attendees if it is not of the $6 Heineken variety officially sanctioned by the festival.

What is most endearing about MusicfestNW is its ability to preserve an intimate atmosphere despite its ballooning size. Traveling to one of the smaller acts in an out-of-the-way corner of town is rewarded with a gracious act, a great crowd, and a quality atmosphere. These are things that may not have been be encountered at the bigger acts at Pioneer Courthouse Square, but that’s okay because the smaller venues are always an option. Some might feel that MusicfestNW is too big for its own good, but this is a necessity of its universality: MusicfestNW is a festival for everyone. It’s for the young, the old, the rich, the dumb, the lame, the music snob, and all people in between. The only people MusicfestNW excludes are the poor, because at $70 a pop for the most basic of tickets it’s no bargain.
