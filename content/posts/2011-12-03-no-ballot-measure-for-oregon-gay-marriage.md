A couple of weeks ago, on Nov 9<sup>th</sup> Basic Rights Oregon (BRO) decided not to put a measure for gay marriage on the Oregon ballot in 2012, and to continue their public education campaign to build support in preparation for a ballot measure at a later date. After hearing feedback from supporters, running polls, and holding a town hall meeting, the Board of Directors concluded that they should not move forward into a political fight until they are ready to win, and that a second loss at the ballot on marriage equality would be too heavy a blow, especially for gay and lesbian youth.

Article 15, Section 5a of Oregon&#8217;s state constitution says that “only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or legally recognized as a marriage.” This has been the case ever since the initiative Measure 36 was passed in 2004 and amended the constitution, with 57% voting to ban gay marriage and 43% voting for gay marriage (a 14-point margin, about 280,000 votes). Furthermore, the courts have rejected legal challenges to this section and the state legislature cannot  overturn a constitutional amendment. Although Governor John Kitzhaber and Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley support marriage equality, there is only one possible way for gay marriage to be legalized in Oregon: A ballot initiative that repeals Article 15 must be approved by a majority of Oregon voters. There is no other option.

In the past seven years public opinion has shifted. BRo has been phonebanking, canvassing, and running commercials on television in favor of marriage equality. They stress that gay couples love and are committed to one another, and that they are families just like any other. These efforts have been aimed at areas where voters haven&#8217;t had much interaction with or knowledge about gay couples, such as small towns and rural areas. Additionally, the goal is to build a consensus and persuade people to vote _for_ marriage equality, not to run a negative campaign against those opposing it.

Right now public opinion is almost exactly divided on whether gay marriage should be legal—in June 2011 a poll conducted by Public Policy Polling found that 48% of Oregon voters thought it should be legal while 42% thought it should be illegal and 11% were unsure. When specifically asked, 43% favored gay marriage while 33% were more inclined toward civil unions and only 22% opposed any legal recognition of gay relationships, but advocates have made it clear that they will not push for civil unions.

Young voters overwhelmingly support gay marriage, and even if advocates for marriage equality were to do nothing, public opinion for it is slowly increasing, with about 1% more people favoring it every year. However, support is heavily concentrated in Portland and even more heavily concentrated in Multnomah County, while opposition is strongest in eastern Oregon and rural areas. This explains why Basic Rights Oregon is focusing so much on those areas and trying to persuade voters who are undecided or opposed: There aren&#8217;t enough supporters of gay marriage to pass a ballot initiative unless they can attract a substantial portion of those who are unsure how to vote.

The decision to delay the ballot initiative for marriage equality is a hard one, but the future looks encouraging for gay marriage in Oregon. Every passing year brings more support, and if current trends continue, the question will not be whether gay marriage will happen, but when.
