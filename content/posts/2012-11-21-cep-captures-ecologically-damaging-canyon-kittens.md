Students have eagerly adopted the numerous cats that live in the Canyon as a part of Reed lore, dubbing them “Canyon kittens,” but whether they’re a feline blessing or a grimalkin curse depends on who you ask.

Canyon Specialist Zac Perry says that cats pose a threat to the health of the Canyon ecosystem. According to the Portland Audobon’s Wildlife Care Center, a local wildlife rehabilitation organization, nearly 40% of the injured animals they take in were wounded by cats.

The birds in the Canyon are more important ecological players than they might seem at first glance. Birds killed by cats in Portland have travelled thousands of miles their wintering sites in Central and South America. Cat kills in Oregonian backyards can have significant impacts on ecosystems beyond Oregon.

But freshman Brydon Brancart would prefer that the kittens stay, ecological damage and all. “Do you really want a stable environment that isn’t cute?” he asks. Luckily for Brancart, says Academic Special Events Coordinator Brittney Corrigan-McElroy, who has been a part the effort to trap the kittens, Reed’s feral cats are mostly living off dumpster scraps, not birds in the Canyon.

CEP has been working actively since the summer to round up the cats as part of a humane “rehoming” and neuter-release program in collaboration with the Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon. Corrigan-McElroy, Academic Special Events Coordinator, says CEP seeks to prevent a potential kitten population explosion and find the cats better lives.

The numerous kittens scurrying about campus can be traced back to the famous tuxedo cat, Ms. Tuxedo Patches. Ms. Tuxedo Patches has been living at Reed for the past 2 ½ years, since she herself was a kitten. Since then, she has had four kitten litters.

CEP caught the first two litters, and all but one of the kittens in the third, and “rehomed” them. The kitten that got away, Pretty Kitty, a beautiful orange tabby cat, was finally captured last Thursday.

But Pretty Kitty was seven months old, too old to be rehomed. Instead, he was neutered, vaccinated, and released in keeping with the policy of the Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon. According to the Feral Cat Society, the kindest thing to do for feral cats of this age is to release them into a healthy colony as rehoming would be too stressful. Pretty Kitty’s ear has been clipped, the universal sign of a neutered feral cat.

Now only Ms. Tuxedo Patches and her three three-month-old kittens remain. Corrigan-McElroy says Ms. Tuxedo Patches is extremely cunning and completely feral, making her nearly impossible to trap. The traps, given to CEP by the Oregon Humane Society, do not hurt the kittens.

The kittens and their mother are currently living under the gas shed near the Cerf Amphitheater. If caught, they will require extra effort to tame, as do all feral cats, but interested parties can contact CEP for adoption information.
