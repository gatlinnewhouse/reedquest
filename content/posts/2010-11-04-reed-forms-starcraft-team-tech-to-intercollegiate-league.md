Mattias Lehman paces around the McKinley common room, scratching his chin. &#8220;I used exclusively zerglings up until Gold tier, but above that, that strategy begins to fail.&#8221; He turns his attention to other things. &#8220;What I’d really like pull off next match is the Medivac Ultralisk Ball. Or Zealot Hydra Medivac.&#8221;

Don’t worry if none of this makes sense to you; it’s nothing more than sports jargon from the captain of Reed’s newest intercollegiate team. This year, Reed entered the Collegiate Star League, an online StarCraft league that pits colleges against each other in battles involving strategy, resource management, and space marines.

In layman’s terms, StarCraft is one of the most widely played—and as a consequence of this, most competitive—computer games in the world. The game’s primary feature is its multiplayer, in which players choose one of three races—the Zerg, Protoss, and Terran—to duke it out. Exemplary of this is its position as the de facto national pastime of South Korea, where games are televised nationally and famous StarCraft-letes are asked to carry the Olympic torch. Naturally, many colleges and universities have taken hold of this competitive spirit. Last year, the New York Times profiled a CSL match between MIT and Princeton.

This is the first time Reed has actively involved itself in any sort of competition. In previous years, ARG and other Reed organizations have held StarCraft events throughout the year and during Paideia. The game’s sequel, which was released this past summer, prompted Lehman to try playing competitively.

“I never played more than four or five games of the original,” Lehman said. “After StarCraft II came out I played in a few tournaments hosted by online StarCraft communities. I lost most of my games, but it was good practice.”

Upon returning to Reed this semester, Lehman gauged interest among other players and quickly put a team together.

“It was really a last minute thing,” he said. “We committed to the league the day before everything was due.”

The current roster features Lehman (Zerg), Colin Drumm (Protoss), Sam Weinrott (who selects randomly), and Ximeng Zhang (Zerg). Their division includes Chicago, Brown, and Johns Hopkins.

Since the season began two weeks ago, the team has played UC Riverside and McGill, both of which defeated Reed by significant margins. But Lehman says that this type of loss is expected.

“Both teams are powerhouses, so we weren’t really disappointed,” Lehman said. “One of their guys is ranked in the top 200 in the United States, and he didn’t even play. We’ve got four people who play casually.”

Interesting to note here is Lehman’s consideration of the word “casual.” He remarks casually that he will never be “really good” because he only plays for two hours a day. Additionally, each member of Reed’s “casual” team has a score of 1,400 in the top tier of online StarCraft play, which is considered to indicate a high level of proficiency.

To this point, the team is taking steps to become increasingly more competitive. They’ve begun playing together, creating an internal structure for the team and mapping out concrete strategies.

The latter, of course, employs that quirky sense of intellect that you would expect a Reed StarCraft team.

“I actually wrote a Haskell program which tracks how many minerals you have and have used at a given time,” says Lehman. “It’s one of the nerdiest things I’ve ever done. It was basically like StarCraft and Jim Fix at the same time.”

Still, Lehman sees this as a learning year for the team and is primarily interested in building something for the future.

“With the exception of Ximeng, everyone who is playing right now is a senior. Our goal is to create a foundation, be vaguely competitive and leave behind some strong players,” he remarked. “I mean, one or two wins would be nice, too.”

The team plays Purdue this Saturday. They think they’ve got a pretty good chance.
