President Colin Diver is unable to predict whether Reed’s fundraising effort this year will prove successful. The money, however, already has a purpose: Reed needs the funds to finance yearly expenditures. Yet Reed strives to use any surplus to increase the endowment and accomplish Centennial goals. Gifts from youngest graduates — and even current students — are wanted for more reliable future campaigns.

“The reality is that this college does not charge enough tuition to cover [its] costs, so we rely on gifts and endowments,” said Hugh Porter, vice president for college relations. The school relies heavily on donations for everything from everyday maintenance to faculty salaries to campus development.

Reed, however, faces more acute troubles than most colleges in the down economy because of its size.

“We don’t have an ever expanding base of donors. We have to raise money from our friends,” Porter said. Reed, soon to be one hundred years old, started out with an extremely small class of 46 has only grown to about 1500 students. This means fundraising efforts must repeatedly target a small group of “friends,” only about 16,000 in all.

Last year saw Reed surpass its fundraising goal in one of the hardest economic years. $30 million were raised last year, up from just over $6 million the previous year. This astounding total was achieved while only 28% of all Reed alumni—about 4,000—contributed last year. The fantastic feat, however, is due to an $18 million bequest to the school by alum and fantasy fiction author, David Eddings. These unpredictable gifts are vital to the survival and expansion of the college but their unreliability causes many challenges.

Diver recognizes that “Meeting our annual fund goal this year—like last year—will probably depend very heavily on several very large gifts (in the $50,000-$100,000 range)” but he sees that “Long-term we need to broaden the base of the pyramid ($500 to $5000 annual donors) and increase the overall rate of alumni participation.” Increasing the number of small donations would provide more stable money for everyday costs. Larger donations could then be applied to goals such as building on campus or becoming need-blind. A balance must be struck between maintaining and improving the college until this goal is achieved.

“In fact, we are not going to cut something,” replied Porter about whether money would be diverted from other areas to finance the Performing Arts Center. Alternative plans for the building are being examined in case Reed does not raise sufficient funds. With Reed celebrating its 100th year in 2011, the college has outlined the construction of a new arts center as one of the 12 goals in its Centennial Campaign. Many of these goals, however, depend on a portion of the $100 million in total prospective large gifts. The college has successfully raised almost three quarters of the $200 million dollar goal and Diver is optimistic with over two years remaining.

“If we are going to stick to our core mission and do it well, we must raise more money from donors and build up the endowment faster,” Diver said. Two strategies are being implemented: a focus on the youngest alumni and education of current students about the college’s dependence on charitable contributions. Signs in both of these areas show promise for Reed’s prospects.

“Giving from Reed’s youngest alumni (graduates from the ten most recent years) is actually on the rise,” notes Lindsay Nealon, associate director of Annual Fund & Stewardship. The large graduating classes of recent years could provide the numbers needed to solidify the base of Diver’s pyramid.

Four ‘10 students raised over $11,000 for a financial aid scholarship from students last year, Nealon said. The first ever solicitation of funds from current Reed students surpassed expectations with 213 students contributing $6,707 and Diver personally matched the sum. These graduating students, and many in the community, recognized the importance of these contributions—a promising sign for Reed’s fundraising future.
