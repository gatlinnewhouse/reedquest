An ad hoc committee, created in response to this winter’s Paideia controversy, met this past Tuesday to discuss the purpose of the committee. Student Body President Ari Galper says, “Because he [Kroger] called for the creation of this committee, we should discuss what happened this past Paideia… I don’t think our job is to harp on this past Paideia, but to address Paideia holistically.”

Galper, who was asked to be a member of the ad hoc committee, sent out a blurb in SB Info earlier this semester soliciting students to take part. Galper says that over twenty students replied to his note. Two students, Renee Mekuria and Lillian Karabaic, were randomly selected. Galper personally selected senior Noah Muldavin, a former Paideia Czar. The committee is comprised of four students, including Galper; three faculty members; and one staff member.

The committee members spent the meeting trying to “solidify goals” and deciding, “what we’re trying to accomplish,” says Galper. Galper adds that the purpose of the committee is not to reformulate or drastically change Paideia. Rather, he says, the committee is meant to assess what Paideia has been, what it is now, and to make suggestions for the future.

The committee is to meet every two weeks. Galper adds that there will be a formal method by which community members can communicate their concerns, but should anyone wish to do so before this system is in place, they should feel free to email him directly.
