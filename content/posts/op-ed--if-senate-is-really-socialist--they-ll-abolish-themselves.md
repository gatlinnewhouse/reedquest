One year ago this week, the Reed Student Senate, in an unprecedented break with the administration, declared Reed College an “autonomous anarcho-socialist state.” Since then, the changes to the college have been … extreme, as I’m sure you know. Barely one week after the announcement, a group of revolutionary Reedies, armed with physical copies of the entire Hum 110 syllabus, ousted the entire administration by simply filling up all Eliot offices with a mountains of ancient Greek and Roman works. “Yeah, the old Hum syllabus was outdated and quite frankly a bit racist, but I guess it did this one job well,” said rebellion leader Comrade Brandy, piling the last of 6,666 copies of _The Oxford Annotated Bible_ in Kroger’s office and slamming the door before any could tumble out. “Maybe it’s not the worst thing that they never got around to actually reforming it.”

However, despite the anti-administrative sentiment pervading the 2017 Reed Revolution, almost no one questioned Senate’s takeover of the college once the former admin was out of the way. The President-turned-Chairperson has had their term infinitely extended, of course, and so has the rest of Senate, but really, no one seemed to notice at the time — it was during Finals Week, after all — and at this point, it seems almost too late to complain.

However, as a STEM major, complaining is what I do best, so here’s my piece, bluntly: I don’t think the Senate is doing a good job leading us. Funding Poll has come up short once more, despite what Our Great Chairperson says. Mining Reedie brainpower for Bitcoin is all well and good for the endowment, but for us students it makes everyday feel like finals. Where is our anarcho-socialist utopia? Where is our leaderless, cooperative society? Senate, if you truly mean for us to live in the society you promised us a year ago, you will abolish yourselves as soon as possible. The Senate administration in and of itself goes directly against the goals of our promised revolution, almost as much as the required P.E. and group requirements we abolished nearly a year ago.

Senate, we all depend on you to do the right thing. Please, for the love of atheism, communism, and all things unholy, resign as soon as you subdue the reactor. Yes, it is true that one anonymous reactor trainee has been quoted as saying “The NRC \[Nuclear Regulatory Commission\] would be cool with us making nukes as long as we only use them on the Reed Commies, right?” However, it seems unlikely that the reactor would really risk damaging their tax-unmaintained private property, and as our surprise attack is planned for \[REDACTED\], we have the upper hand and will soon not need Senate — or anyone, for that matter — to lead us.

Atheism, Communism, Free Reed!
