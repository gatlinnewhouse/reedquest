Reed’s efforts to improve its graduation rates have been successful.

New data shows that the four-year graduation rate has jumped ten percent—rising from 60 percent to 70 percent—for the class of 2010 to the class of 2011. Graduation rates have been increasing, but Mike Tamada, Director of Institutional Research at Reed, finds “a jump this big a rare thing.”

Reed has been working to improve its graduation rate since the early 1990s. In 1991, the graduation rate was 33 percent, largely because many students left Reed before graduating. To address the issue, the college created a retention committee that was charged with investigating why students were leaving and what could be done to fix it. This was not the first retention committee, but perhaps the most successful. The committee published a report, “Retention and Attrition at Reed: A Status Report.”

Jeff Parker, a Professor of Economics and a member of the retention committee, said, “[they] found that there was a major attrition threshold after sophomore year.”

Reed sophomores, he said, were unhappy each year because they felt alienated, fitting into neither their former dorm and Hum 110 communities nor their future major communities. Parker explained that there were many other factors influencing why students left and that research helped the committee identify strategies that Reed could use to improve retention. These goals included admitting the “right” students to Reed, finding ways for students to succeed academically, and developing ways for them to succeed personally.

Much of Olde Reed embodied a sink-or-swim attitude. As Parker, who has been teaching here for over two decades, stated, “the mentality of some faculty was if everyone did well, we’re too easy.”

This attitude led to students failing and dropping out, or transferring. The retention committee report hypothesized that, “Reed does not adequately support students who stumble.” With the retention committee and the efforts of Student Services—which at the time, according to Parker, was viewed as unimportant for Reed’s academic mission—major changes were made to the school’s culture and policy in an attempt to keep students.

The retention committee and Student Services wanted to provide newer, more attractive dorms and upgraded food services. Parker explained that before Bon Appétit, the food system in Commons was an all-you-can-eat system run by another large company. Students taking advantage of the plan and feeding their friends who were not on board plans, and the company cut food quality in response. Bon Appétit ****was a huge improvement because they employed a balance system, which we now use, which prevented abuse of the system and allowed Common’s food to maintain food quality.

Before more dorms were built, only 30 to 40 percent of students lived on campus, which, Parker explained, did help retention rates. Off-campus communities could be dysfunctional, and the committee recognized that real-estate prices were on the rise, which made living off-campus more difficult for students. Parker added, “The dorms were built partially in anticipation of that problem and partially because we really believed that we would stimulate more campus community if more students lived on campus.” Today, Reed’s goal is to provide on-campus housing for seventy-five percent of students.

In addition to improving living conditions, the college began paying closer attention to students’ social and academic well-being.

James Tederman, the Dean of Student Services at the time, changed perceptions that Student Services had no place at Reed. He brought in programs for academic help, emotional help, and general support of the student body—programs that were virtually nonexistent before. Tutoring was also looked down upon. Parker said, “The DoJo is a new phenomenon. Now, tutoring does not carry the same stigma it held before.”

Finally, the committee aimed to communicate to applicants a more honest image of the Reed community and the intense academic culture. A key goal was to attract the right kind of student—students who knew what Reed was all about—in order to retain more of the student body as years progress.

Tamada explained that compared to the average state school, Reed has a good graduation rate. But compared to schools at Reed’s caliber, the graduation rate is low. “In order to achieve higher graduation rates,” he said, “Reed has to have higher retention rates.”

For a school with historically low graduation rates, however, Tamada said, “the signs are positive.”

Parker noted, “we haven’t gotten to 70 percent by lowering standards, we got there by improving students.” He didn’t hesitate to add that Reed is not right for everyone. He said, “if we had a 99 percent retention rate, we also wouldn’t be doing our job.”

How many Reedies will walk across the stage in May 2014? So far, the freshman to sophomore retention rate is 92 percent.
