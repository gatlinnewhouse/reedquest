Reed turns one hundred in fall of 2011, and it’s going to party all year long. The celebration officially starts at Reunions 2011 in June, and runs until Reunions 2012; in between Reed will throw two huge parties, publish three books, and complete a $200 million fund-raising campaign.

The first classes at Reed opened on September 18, 1911, in temporary quarters at the corner of 11th and Jefferson in downtown Portland. At the time there were fifty students and five faculty members.

Since then the college has grown to instruct 1,477 students, employ one hundred and thirty full-time faculty members, and erected numerous buildings across its 116-acre campus.

Planning for the Centennial started ten years ago when the Alumni Association decided to gather oral history, said Mike Teskey, Director of Alumni & Parent Relations. Alumni were taught professional oral history techniques and class storytelling sessions were organized at reunion events. Faculty and staff were interviewed in addition to alumni, and more than three hundred interviews were collected. The interviews are being edited into a book of oral history by alumnus John Sheehy ‘82.

“Most colleges will have professors write the definitive history of the college. This is something different,” Teskey said.

One interview with a 100-year-old alumna totaled ninety-eight pages when transcribed, said Gay Walker ‘69, Special Collections librarian.

“They wanted to tell the story of the college through the voices of alumni,” Bates said.

Drafts of the book are currently under review, and it should be ready for publication fall of 2011, Teskey said.

Student Activities is organizing a two-day party to celebrate the Centennial on September 23 and 24 of 2011, said Kristin Holmberg, Director of Student Activities. Notable local figures will be invited to a large reception in Kaul Auditorium, and there should be a big show in the Quad, along with fireworks.

A field day will follow the reception on Saturday. The refurbished orchard will be dedicated, and a time capsule will be removed from the cornerstone of Eliot Hall.
  
In celebration of the Gray Fund’s 20th anniversary Student Activities will also put together a variety show with five or six big-name personalities in Spring 2012, Holmberg said.

The orchard on the east side of the Canyon will be refurbished as part of the student centennial project, Holmberg said. Benches and tables will be added to the area, and dead trees will be removed in order to make room for new trees that bear fruit in the fall.

A cookbook of student recipes is being put together by Salim Moore ‘11, a current senior, said Jennifer Bates, Director of Public Affairs.

A Reed day of service will be organized through SEEDS, Bates said.

Reunions will feature a number of special events. In addition to events celebrating Lloyd Reynolds, a former professor of calligraphy, and Mary Barnard ‘33, a definitive translator of Sappho’s poetry, Colin Diver will join former presidents Paul Bragdon and Steven Koblick on a presidents’ panel. Davis Rogan, a New Orleans jazz artist, will perform, Teskey said.

“It’s a tamer, adult Renn Fayre,” Teskey said.

The celebration coincides with the college’s Centennial Campaign, which aims to raise $200 million in support of academic programs, financial aid, and other costs of the college, said Hugh Porter, Vice President of College Relations.

“On a per capita basis, this is the largest campaign to be attempted in the Pacific Northwest and stacks up well against other liberal artscollege efforts nationally,” Porter said. To date $144 million has been pledged or contributed.

Notable gifts include $20 million from Reed alumnus and fantasy fiction writer David Eddings and a $10 million commitment by recently-retired trustee board chairman Dan Greenberg. Reed students contributed almost $7,000 to the campaign last year.

A Centennial website containing a history of the college’s first twenty-five years, along with a number of historical documents, has been constructed by Walker, Bates said. The next ninety years of material should be online sometime next year.

The college’s inaugural address, a history of Amanda Reed, and other such documents are available in PDF form on the website.

“It was easy because it just went up to 1920,” Walker said. The college must get permission to publish everything after 1923 because of copyright law.

“We had students working full-time over the summer scanning documents,” Walker said.

The next set of documents will primarily include college publications and photos, though some smaller pieces will be published. For example, letters received by Phil Whalen ‘51, a beat poet, from figures such as Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder ‘51, and Lew Welch ‘50 were donated to the library and will be made available. All of the theses written at Reed, letters of Simeon Reed, and other materials are available for study in Special Collections.

Oregon Public Broadcasting will produce a documentary on the history of Reed College, Bates said.

A compilation of essays by thirty-three Reed alumni tentatively titled “The Reed Festschrift” will be compiled by Roger Porter, professor of English, and Robert Reynolds, professor emeritus of Physics.

“In each essay the writer speaks about his or her career, the contributions they have made, and how their undergraduate years at Reed influenced and inspired the work they have gone on to do,” Porter said. These alumni include Steve Raichlen ‘75, an author of barbeque cookbooks, Barbara Ehrenreich ‘63, a writer on social class in America, and Gary Snyder ‘51, an American poet.

Some of the best Hum 110 lectures will be compiled and published in Reed Magazine by Peter Steinberger, professor of political science, Bates said.

David Goines, an American artist and typographer, has been hired to produce a visual representation of the college. The poster will be created early next fall, Teskey said.

“[The Centennial] means a lot of work for a lot of people. Everyone is involved,” Bates said.
