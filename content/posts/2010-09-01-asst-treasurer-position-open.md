Classes have started, but the key position of student body assistant treasurer remains open, said Cori Savaiano, head treasurer of the student body.

Typically the assistant treasurer position is filled at the end of each semester.

&#8220;None of the previous applicants were qualified enough for the position,&#8221; said Austin Campbell, vice president of the student body.

The position was first announced on the Student Information Network halfway into the semester, said Adarsh Pyarelal, chair of appointments committee on Senate last spring. Though the deadline for application was extended several times only 3 students applied.

Flagging interest in student body politics is to blame for the poor turnout, Pyarelal said.

Applications will be avilable on the physical moodle in the Gray Campus Center hallways, and will be due Monday, September 6 in MS 960, Savaiano said. The new treasurer will not be part of signators&#8217; training, but hsould be picked in time for Senate&#8217;s funding cycle.

Applicants should be highly organized and have prior experience with student body funds, Savaiano said.

The position&#8217;s duties involve assisting the other treasurers and performing basic office work, such as filing and writing checks, Campbell said. Treasurers serve for three semesters, spending one term each as assistant, vice, and head treasurer.

Starting pay for the position is $180 per month for five months.
