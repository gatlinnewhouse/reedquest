In a lovely reminder of the bad blood from the beginning of the semester, we’ve received a pile of criticism as of late. Most of it, unfortunately, has attacked our newspaper anonymously and not been constructive. If you have problems with the product we are publishing, please come talk to us instead of sending harsh anonymous e-mails and requesting that Senate withhold our funds.

I will admit, we have made a few mistakes. In the midst of our layout haze we passed over information regarding appointments committee and the treasure box. In other circumstances, however, if some beat is missing, it’s because nothing newsworthy happened. I have spent my fair share of hours at endless Senate meetings, and I think it’s a waste of space to describe how our student body representatives discussed an obscure issue that has no ramifications for others.

As for the advice columns that have disappeared, we felt that, as the satire we ran last week showed, more often than not they turned into opportunities for authors to be jerks to others in a public forum where they were not immediately accountable. We regret running these sorts of things, and intend not to in the future. Strong, informative pieces that give insightful commentary on how to survive at this draining institution are worth running. In print medium we have limited space, and we want to do our best to make sure that it’s all worth reading.

So if you have problems with your newspaper, talk to us. Let us know how we can improve the paper, do not request Senate to kill it. We are trying to do the best damn job possible given our restricted resources and experience; if there are issues that we are not covering, step up and cover them! Is there an issue you are deeply passionate about? Write an opinion piece. Use your newspaper to be heard far and wide.

A number of students have already been in touch with us, asking to write pieces and help out with the newspaper. Jacob Canter and Julia Lee stepped us this week; Ben Williams, Alice Newton, Caroline Blair, and Jamie Perkins all have in weeks past. Thank you! You’ll see more new authors in the coming issues; let them know what you think of their writing.

We also really want to break the sexy desperate senior feature out of the closed Senate/Quest circle; we’ve resorted to most people featured so far because we see them often and can easily get them to reply. Feeling sexy? Feeling desperate? E-mail us! We also want to start running postcards from thesis hell next semester; if you feel stressed and are interested, get in touch as soon as possible.

Pug love,
