A Title IX investigation into alleged inequitable treatment of women’s teams and facilities by the Sports Center concluded on March 23, but the Women’s Rugby team says the investigation failed to address their concerns. The investigation, which found Reed to be in compliance with Title IX, was opened in February after the Women’s Rugby team [leveled complaints against the Sports Center following a controversy in which the team’s coach resigned and funding for team league play was pulled by the administration][1]. Title IX, passed in 1972, forbids sex-based discrimination by schools that receive Federal funding.

The Title IX report, conducted by Treasurer and Title IX officer Ed McFarlane, found the average annual funding from 2009 to 2012 for each of Reed’s eight women’s teams to be $7,326 and for each of Reed’s twelve men’s teams to be $7,425. However, members of the Women’s Rugby team raised concerns that a more than $30,000 difference between the $89,101 that the men’s teams received from 2009 to 2012 and the $58,609 that the women’s teams received represented inequitable treatment.

McFarlane said about the difference in an email, “[W]e want to be sure that the environment for teams is such that women&#8217;s or men&#8217;s teams are being encouraged, treated and supported equitably. So dollars spent is a sort of proxy for equality and needs to be somewhat in line for each team. But the most important measure is whether or not the team&#8217;s needs are being met.”

Women’s Rugby isn’t satisfied.

Members of the team said in an interview that their jerseys, purchased in 2006, are outdated and so loose that they can be used by opponents to fling players to the ground. The Men’s team, once wearing jerseys from 2002, acquired used but newer jerseys in 2009. In 2011 the Sports Center, in consultation with the Women’s Rugby coach and equipment overseer Frank Zornado, decided that the Women’s team’s jerseys did not need to be replaced.

The Title IX report recommends that the Sports Center “continue and strengthen its efforts to diversify staff.” Currently, all full-time Sports Center staff are male. Lombardo said of those who applied for positions at the Sports Center, “the demographic is such that I don’t get a lot of diversity.”

The report also recommends that the Sports Center “consider developing and implementing written policies/procedures that provides clear guidance” on communication between the Sports Center and teams, expectations for “team/player behavior,” and “the disciplinary process” for “teams/players that fail to meet behavior expectations.”

The Sports Center has already begun work on a “Reed College Club Sport Handbook,” that would, according to Lombardo, codify in a “structured, formalized way” policies whose murkiness was a source of friction between the Women’s Rugby team and the Sports Center after the team’s coach, Valerie Burns, resigned in late January.

Miscommunication was common in the February talks between Dean of Students Mike Brody, the Women’s Rugby team, and Lombardo. Upon reading that the administration would not “support or sanction team travel or league play at this time,” in an email by Brody, members of the Women’s Rugby team misunderstood the statement to mean that Women’s Rugby had been “cancelled,” and raised a storm of alumni response in support of the team.

The Women’s Rugby team, when shown Lombardo’s response to complaints made by the team prior to the Title IX investigation, disputed several of his claims. Liz Mastrangelo ’13, who plays the position of Hooker on the team, said in an email, “this makes it seem like the administration is totally reasonable, and we&#8217;re throwing a temper tantrum because they got mad at us for behaving badly. It also makes it seem like we&#8217;re pulling the gender card because it&#8217;s convenient. I cannot emphasize to you enough how hurtful that take on this whole issue has been. The fact is female athletes at Reed are being underserved by the Sports Center, and I believe Michael Lombardo is the main reason for this.”

Lombardo wrote in one part of his response to the team’s complaints, “The current Men’s Rugby coach was the women’s coach prior, but due to conflicts with the women’s team in the past years he chose to step down. This is a pattern that has repeated itself for the past 4 years with the women’s team.”

Women’s Rugby players disagree. They say that the team requested the removal of a coach due to conflicts with the team, but, in two prior instances, Lombardo chose not to renew annual contracts of coaches, who were “loved by all,” without consulting members of the team. Lombardo said, “I make decisions to renew or not renew coaches’ contracts based on a broad range of considerations, including but not limited to coach interest/availability, student input, budget, experience and qualifications, schedules, probability of coach/student compatibility, etc.”

Accused of refusing to engage in mediation through the Honor process after Women’s Rugby faced scrutiny from the Sports Center for bringing alcohol to the ski cabin on what Lombardo considered a Sports Center sponsored trip, Lombardo wrote, “I have never refused mediation through the Honor process.” No mediation between Lombardo and members of the team has occurred.

Lombardo wrote in a personal statement given to _The Quest,_ “When I consider the circumstances surrounding this particular complaint, which was filed within a relatively short time from the decision to suspend the Women’s Rugby team from play, I cannot help but wonder if it represents a misguided effort to divert attention away from the regrettable conduct of a small number of players whose behavior triggered the team’s suspension.” Members of the Women’s Rugby team denied the accusation, saying that they had complaints against the Sports Center before they made their formal complaint. Lombardo said he was “aware of other informal complaints that were made before the team was suspended.”

Though not currently playing in a league, the Women’s Rugby team found new coaches in mid-February, both of which have played on the USA Rugby Women’s National Team.
