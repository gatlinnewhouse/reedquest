_Community Members Win Bike Commute Challenge_

If Adidas employees challenged Reed College employees to an athletic challenge, who do you think would win? What about the Nike staff challenging our Reed professors in this sports feat? Do you think our faculty and staff could defeat any of these companies filled with jocks?

If you thought our academic institution had no chance, well, you couldn’t be more wrong. Reed College beat them all in this year’s Bike Commute Challenge (BCC) – as well as another 76 NGOs and Companies that have 500+ employees. None of them could handle what Reed brought to the court.

Well, not exactly the court, but to the road. The BCC is an event held every year in September run by the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA), a Portland based organization that dealt with the 10,833 riders that participated in the BCC this year. Our Reed team had 88 faculty and staff, and 35 of them being new riders that started commuting by bike just this year or during the competition.

To win our sector of the competition, 10.9 percent of all commutes by all 500 Reed faculty and staff members (not including student workers) was done via bike – 1.1 percent higher than the second place team from Wieden and Kennedy and 5.6 percent higher than Lewis and Clark, who got fifth place. The BTA honored the winners in all the different sections of the competition in early October, but the organization does much more than that.

“[The BTA] work[s] on advocacy at the state and local levels to create bicycling convenient and more accessible for people of all ages and abilities,” says Lily Karabaic, a second year non-traditional student who worked for several years at the BTA. “They work on safe routes to school [making] walking and cycling more accessible and…[have] bike safety workshops at 80 different schools in Oregon.”

The BTA has worked in Oregon to convince more and more people that biking is the most environmentally, physically and fiscally friendly way to get around, but they know well that their greatest advocate is mother nature – it is so easy to ride when the sun is shining. This is why part of Lily’s job while with the BTA was teaching professional workers to commute to and from work in the warm weather.

“I would answer questions like ‘What do I do with my hair when I get to work? Do I need to change? Should I bring rain gear? What type of bike should I ride? How should I plan my route?’ These are the kind of things people are really thinking about if they’re considering commuting to work on a bike for the first time,” Karabaic said.

Answering these questions gave people the comfort to bike to work, but the riders themselves had to have the drive to get the spandex on. Matt Kelly, a Development and Communications Coordinator at Reed, was the Team Captain and coordinated all the team’s efforts; David Garrett, a popular humanities and history professor and team member, biked thirty minutes each way (and looked good doing it); and Todd Hesse, a member of the Alumni and Parent Relations department, biked a total of 400 miles this September.

“There are a lot of people here at Reed who take [biking to school] very seriously,” says Hesse, a lifetime bike commuter. He doesn’t ride on the team for the glory of victory – he didn’t even realize we won – but rides as much because of the community biking builds as the environmental and physical benefits it brings. “It’s a good community of people riding and it’s not like car drivers are out there waving to each other as they go by. I recognize the other cyclist, I wave to each one of them I see and its nice to be a part of that community.”

This group of cyclists has done more than make a community. The results for this year’s Bike Commute Challenge are staggering: In only the month of September, these 10,833 riders biked a total of 1,166,247 miles instead of driving in their cars –2,500 of those were new riders. With a couple quick calculations ($2.95/gallon of gas—the Oregon state average price and 18 miles/gallon—the fuel economy of America’s top selling 2010 car, the Chevrolet Impala) it becomes clear that these commutes have saved 64,791.5 gallons of gas and $191,134.93 dollars that would have been spent on gas.

“Everyone should bike,” says David Garrett. “You get in your little zone as you bike along and it’s quite nice.”
