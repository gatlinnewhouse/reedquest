There&#8217;s a group of students that aren&#8217;t Olde Reed, but they sure are old for Reed. Nontraditionally aged students have existed at Reed for a long time, but for the first time in Reed&#8217;s history, the Multicultural Resource Center and the Student Activities office are joining together to offer specific programming for nontraditional students. Why now? Kyle Webster, assistant director of Student Activities says &#8220;It&#8217;s about time. There&#8217;s a visibility of nontraditional student leaders right now… We&#8217;re hoping to figure out what we can do to better assist nontrads. We don&#8217;t totally know what nontrads need yet.&#8221;

Webster is pleased that the first official event last Wednesday drew 17 nontraditional students. In the Fall 2011 term, there are 35 undergraduate students over the age of 24 enrolled at Reed College, and that number may include some traditionally-aged students that are simply slightly older or took a gap year. For the 2011-2012 school year, the age range of new undergraduate students is exceptional: the youngest student is 15, and the oldest is 47.

Nontraditional students face unique challenges, which can include balancing outside work and family responsibilities, arranging childcare, long commutes, and difficulty integrating into student social life at Reed. Melissa Osborne, a 29-year-old student with two children says, &#8220;My varied life experiences gave me a different outlook that served me very well in conferences. What did I find difficult? Breaking into the social sphere at Reed.&#8221;

During the 2010 orientation, a student-organized event for non-traditional students was held at Pix. 14 people showed up to the event, and afterwards,  a mailing list was formed and informal gatherings for non-traditional students continued all year long. At last older students had a forum to share their experiences with students going through the same challenges. Osborne notes that, &#8220;With non-traditional students, it is kind of a two-sided thing. On one side, we need to have a community together. At the same time, we need to collaborate with other groups and spend time with the rest of the Reed community.&#8221;

The Reed student group for nontraditional students, which has not yet formalized a name, expressed hopes at for the 2011-12 school year at their potluck on August 28th, including the allocation of an office space for nontraditional students, creation of a guidebook for nontraditional students, and access to staff childcare resources and events. While the group is excited about increased institutional support,  nontraditional student Michael Kincaid says, &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t stop having our own events just because they have official events now.&#8221;
