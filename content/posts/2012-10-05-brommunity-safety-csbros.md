Just who is Brommunity Safety, and what do they want? Surrounded by hotdogs and rootbeer supplied by members of the group, Director of Community Safety Gary Granger says one thing is certain: “They’re not mocking us.”

Brommunity Safety is made up of “fans of community safety that want to help with community safety events,” says Aaron McCray-Goldsmith ‘14, founder of the student group. The  organization’s official description reads, “Brommunity Safety is dedicated to spreading the love for our wonderful Community Safety Officers. We will accomplish this through informal events…creating a space for students and CSOs to mingle and discuss the issues within our community.”

Root beer pong, hotdogs, and Segway rides covered the quad during Brommunity Safety’s first official event last Thursday. Hungry Reedies devoured over 120 hotdogs and a keg of root beer in under an hour.

Some students have seen a silver Honda CRV with a Brommunity Safety decale and wondered if it is connected to the student group. The Brommunity Safety vehicle is actually McCray-Goldsmith’s car. “I just decided to slap some decals on it one day” says McCray-Goldsmith. “I used to get driven to middle school in that beast.”

Brommunity Safety was conceived last year after Paideia when administrators pressured CSOs to do walk-throughs of Chittick’s P.I.G. (People Ingesting Gourmet) community and banned P.I.G. from hosting events that were advertised campus-wide after, they claimed, Chittick had developed a negative campus image. Both Community Safety and the P.I.G. community were frustrated by the administration’s decision and Granger found a compromise to reduce walk-throughs from three-times-a-day to one, says McCray-Goldsmith.

But the residents of P.I.G. still wanted to find a way around the party ban. “We decided to throw an event that no one could reasonably shoot down: a dinner party for the CSOs called the walk- through dinner. The CSOs loved it, and I decided over the summer to take that idea and make it into something bigger.” says McCray-Goldsmith.

Root beer floats are just one of many events Brommunity Safety hopes to host this year, says McCray-Goldsmith. However, currently there are only about 30 students on the Brommunity Safety’s mailing list, and much fewer are actively involved, says McCray-Goldsmith. He adds that “if you like making large quantities of food available for your student body, I would strongly recommend joining.”
