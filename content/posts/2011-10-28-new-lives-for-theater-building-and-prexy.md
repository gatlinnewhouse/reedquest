As construction on the new Performing Arts Center continues, various administrative bodies at Reed are discussing what to do with the spaces it will make obsolete. Until November 7<sup>th</sup>, the Physical Plant Committee will be accepting proposals from groups across campus on what to do with the theater building and Prexy. The Physical Plant Committee needs the proposals over a year prior to the buildings opening because they expect many proposals to come in and need ample time to figure out the logistics of constructing new spaces.

Dana Loutey, the student senate representative on the Physical Plant Committee, articulated how much work will be needed to complete this process: “The committee will not only be evaluating who needs space the most but also how viable the proposals are and how much money they will cost.” Loutey also noted that major renovations would need to be done to the theater building to make it viable for new uses and to make it comply with ADA regulations. Furthermore, since the theater is nestled in the school’s canyon, all reconstruction must occur within the building itself, a laborious process. Loutey says that the committee will begin looking over the proposals for both the theater building and Prexy at their next meeting on November 17<sup>th</sup>. While Loutey was unaware of any official proposals yet sent to the Physical Plant Committee, speculation has already begun on what the buildings could become.

Nora McConnell-Johnson, the president of student senate, and Loutey both mentioned that faculty and staff would be interested in additional space. Rumors about the admissions office and creative writing department wanting to move into Prexy were mentioned, along with a report that a proposal will come in to have a bouldering wall put in the theater building. McConnell-Johnson expects many more proposals to come in from the faculty and staff up until the deadline, based on the fact that when the Health and Counseling Center moved to their new location near 28 West, there was lots of interest in the space they left behind (the area is now occupied by the Student Activities Office and the Multicultural Resource Center).

Though the memo introducing the requests for proposals were sent out to the staff, faculty and student senators on October 7<sup>th</sup>, at the time of _The Quest_&#8216;s printing the memo has not been presented to the student body. Loutey and McConnell-Johnson both acknowledged that this delay is due to confusion amongst student senators. Senate plans to send out the memo early this week.

McConnell-Johnson expects lots of student body interest in the new space. “I think student space can definitely be improved” said McConnell-Johnson. She suspects that several clubs and student organizations would be interested in finding larger and more permanent spaces for their activities, and believes the theater building would be an ideal space for such groups. Furthermore, Loutey indicated that several members of the student senate are planning on writing a proposal to transform the theater building into a new hub for students. But if you don&#8217;t like this plan, never fear, soon, any student may can put forth a proposal themselves.
