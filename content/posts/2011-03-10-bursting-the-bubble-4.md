In case you missed it, Charlie Sheen went totally and completely batshit crazy. He’s in denial: said Sheen, “I’m not bi-polar, I’m bi-winning!” I’ll leave that to you to decipher, because I have absolutely no idea what that means at all. Guess I’m not a winner. (If you haven’t seen it yet, YouTube the “Charlie Sheen Bi-Winning Dubstep” video.)

GK Films, the production company responsible for The Town and The Departed (notice a theme?), has announced its intentions to reboot the Tomb Raider film series by 2013. Hopefully they’ll be better than the originals. Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life was really painful to watch and totally made my Top Ten Worst Movies I’ve Ever Seen list.

The Real World is about to embark on its 25th season, set in Las Vegas. TWENTY-FIFTH SEASON. This was the pioneer show that paved the way for later greats like Jersey Shore and Bad Girls Club. Viva la reality television, bitches!

Phil Collins is retiring to be a full-time dad. The Grammy and Academy Award winner, former-frontman of Genesis, and musical genius behind the Tarzan soundtrack, is giving up his musical career to attend soccer games, master the art of Play-Doh sculpting, wipe runny noses, and drive a minivan. In actuality, he probably has a chauffeur, but imagining Collins behind the wheel of a Dodge Caravan is pretty priceless.

Warner Bros. is test driving a movie rental service that allows consumers to buy downloads through Facebook. The pay-per-view program, which costs $3 a rental, is Time Warner Inc.’s retaliation to what CEO Jeffrey Bewkes believes to be the negative effect of Netflix on the value of premium programming. Bewkes says that he is also considering making the company wait longer and pay more for TV shows and movies. Between this and Hulu implementing new 30-day delays, college students across the nation are in mourning.

Brigham Young University sophomore Brandon Davies was suspended from the college’s basketball team, the Cougars, after violating the school’s honor code by engaging in premarital sex. And y’all are complaining about the new AOD policy being rough…

The Philadelphia Archdiocese placed twenty-one priests on leave after allegations were made that they had sexually abused minors. FINALLY.

After a disastrous hidden camera video of a now-fired NPR executive – during which said exec stated Tea Party members are “seriously racist” and that NPR would be better off without federal funding – was released to the public, Republicans have renewed efforts calling for cuts in government funding of public broadcasting. NPR and PBS stations across the nation are urging viewers to protest these proposals, as the House Republicans’ aim to cut out all Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds for the remainder of the fiscal year could potentially mean the end of beloved programs such as Sesame Street. Don’t let them take away America’s favorite big yellow bird!

School bullying got out of hand last Thursday when Derontae Ball, 7, was choked with a jump rope by two other second-graders during recess at Northeast Portland’s Woodland Elementary School. Ball was lucky to have survived – a later hospital visit revealed that the attack could have been fatal. Seven-year-olds? Really?!

On Tuesday, twenty-two people were arrested in a sweep of a major heroin-trafficking case throughout the Marion, Polk, and Clackamas counties. During the sweep, nearly 400 grams of drugs were seized. The arrests are a part of an ongoing investigation that has been dubbed “Operation Frogger,” the aim of which is to investigate and prosecute trafficking organizations.

The day before, a 43-year-old man and his girlfriend were arrested after they were found in possession of over 250 lbs of marijuana, 90 marijuana plants, handguns and rifles, and an unspecified amount of cash. “If you sell drugs in Oregon, we are coming after you,” said Attorney General John Kroger. KROGER DON’T MESS AROUND.

On Monday evening, Portland police arrested a man on trespassing charges after he called 911 out of fear of the homeowner. Said homeowner had also called 911 after the suspect, Timothy Chapek, was found taking a shower in a bathroom at 7pm. Chapek, 24, was reportedly afraid that the homeowner possessed a firearm and consequently locked himself in the bathroom to phone the police. I’m pretty sure the cops had a field day with this one.

After analyzing shootings by officers within the past year, Portland police announced Tuesday that they would be adopting new non-lethal weapons in an attempt to reduce instances that involve the use of a lethal firearm. That’s nice, but “it doesn’t always work. [Non-lethal weapons] aren’t as effective as you would like,” said Sgt. Greg Stewart, Bureau Crime Analyst. It’s true – pulling out a can of pepper spray and a short-range taser are probably going to inspire more laughter than fear out of a criminal.

A burglary suspect the Portland police have nicknamed the “Droopy Drawers Bandit” turned himself in on Monday night. He gained the moniker due to video surveillance of his March 3 market burglary, during which the suspect’s pants fell off, revealing bright red boxers underneath. Portland police may actually have the most entertaining job in the universe.
