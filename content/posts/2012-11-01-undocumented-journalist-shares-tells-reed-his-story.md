Jose Antonio Vargas, Pulitzer-winning journalist and immigrant rights advocate, spoke in Kaul Auditorium on Oct. 24, sponsored by the Multicultural Resource Center. Vargas, who lived in the United States for almost 20 years as an undocumented immigrant, revealed his status in a controversial essay in _The New York Times Magazine_ last year.

Vargas last came to Portland ten years ago to get a driver’s license, so he could take a position as a writer for _The Washington Post_. Oregon once issued driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants, but the policy was reversed in 2007 by an executive order by then Governor Ted Kulongski. “This driver’s license was my lifeline. It was why I got to go to the White House, the only reason why I had a job,” Vargas said.

Vargas projected a picture of his expired license and told his sizable audience jokingly: “It’s like a nightmare.” An immigrant from the Philippines, Vargas did not find out that he was undocumented until he tried to get a driver’s license in California when he was 16 years old.

Vargas described having to come out of the closet twice in his life: first, as a gay man when he was 18 years old and, second, as an undocumented immigrant more than 10 years later. One day during Vargas’s senior year of high school, he and his class were watching a documentary about gay politician Harvey Milk. Once it ended, Vargas said he “told everyone I was gay and ran to the bathroom.” However, the journalist kept his immigration status hidden from the world until last year.

In 2011, _The New York Times Magazine_ published Vargas’s essay “My Life as an Undocumented Immigrant” in which the journalist details the trials he had to go through to pursue his vocation as a journalist, the alienation which he experienced as an undocumented Filipino, and his decision to come out of the closet as an undocumented immigrant. “My Life as an Undocumented Immigrant” quickly became the most-emailed article on the _The_ _New York Times_ website.

In an interview backstage, Vargas described the mixed reactions that his essay provoked before and after it was published. He contacted many lawyers who generally agreed that the essay would be “legal suicide.” The more people told Vargas he couldn’t do it, however, the more he felt compelled to do so.

Vargas also described some of the encounters he has had at the grocery store with readers. Some of them have been congratulatory and others shocking. But not all reactions have been positive, he adds. Vargas has received hate mail, though the writer says that it’s been rare.

During his talk, Vargas displayed an email from an angry reader who wrote that they had followed “your anti-American bigotry for quite some time now along with your homosexual bullshit that you spit.” Vargas isn’t immune to scrutiny, and he uses this example to highlight what he thinks is a lack of cross-cultural and cross-racial dialogue.

After his essay was published, Vargas said he expected to receive a call from the government concerning his deportation. He received none. “I was like this invisible person that people wanted to avoid,” he says. Vargas then highlights the importance of the Latino electorate and the need for a more comprehensive immigration law.

Vargas concluded his talk by addressing the anxiety that some might feel because of a changing America. Whether it’s immigration status or sexual orientation, Vargas says one thing is certain: “No one is going back to any closet.”
