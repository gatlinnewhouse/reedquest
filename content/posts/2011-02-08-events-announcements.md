Contact Dana Bays with any questions at [&#x62;&#x61;&#x79;&#x73;&#x64;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1]

**No Summer Plans? Volunteer with the Ecuador Service Project**

The Ecuador Service Project is a student group at Reed that works with a small non-profit in Ecuador to provide aid to indigenous communities. The details of the project change every year based on the specific needs of the communities, but basically it participation involves: a few kick-ass weeks living with indigenous people, speaking Spanish, doing some good-old-fashioned manual labor, and learning some new language (Quechua) and culture. Oh, and it&#8217;s a pretty darn affordable way to travel and get some life experience this summer (the cost of a plane ticket and some odds and ends).

If you&#8217;re anywhere on the scale from remotely-kinda-sorta-interested to &#8220;WOAH.HOLY.SHIT.SIGN.ME.UP!&#8221;, e-mail [Rachel Mossey][2] for more info.

**To Use or Not to Use (Alcohol and Other Drugs)?**

WHO: Current Reed College students aged 18-25

WHAT: Complete a confidential online survey about health behaviors and decisions to use or not use illicit substances and receive a PSYCHOLOGY LOTTERY TICKET (chance to win up to $150!) and thesis karma for participating!
