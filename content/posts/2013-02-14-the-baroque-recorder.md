The recorder, the plastic instrument used to entice unsuspecting children into the magical world of instrumental music, was the centerpiece of the baroque concert, _Baroque Journeys: Michala Petri and Friends._ ROMP, or Reediana Omnibus Musica Philosopha, hosted the concert, which took place in Kaul Auditorium on Friday, Feb. 8 at 7:30 p.m.

As a world-renowed recorder player, Michala Petri brought new depth to the instrument of elementary school. In a few weeks she will be departing on a month long tour of the United States. Born in Denmark, Petri made her debut playing the recorder at the age of five on Danish radio.

The program included pieces by notable Baroque composers and Beethoven. Baroque music, originating in Italy in the 1600’s, is heavily ornamented, in line with the art and architecture of the time. Many pieces, originally composed for violin or oboe, were transposed for the recorder, to great success. In addition to Petri, the concert consisted of a harpsichord and a cello playing a basso continuo.

In addition to the concert, ROMP hosted two lecturers by Robert Harbison and Wendy Heller on Saturday, Feb. 9. Robert Harbison, an art historian, spoke on the “Baroque Opera and Baroque Space” in the morning. Following Harbison, Heller, a Professor of Music at Princeton University, spoke on &#8220;Pan&#8217;s Legacy: Pastoral Shepherds, Virtuoso Devils, and Wind Playing in the Baroque.&#8221; There was an informal brunch for students in between lectures.
