Waiting for a microphone at the start of last week’s Senate meeting, before President Kroger and students faced off on the topics of censorship and student autonomy, Appointments Committee chair Annam Swanson announced that freshmen Oliver Silverton-Peel and Alejandro Chavez-Lopez had been appointed vice and assistant treasurers. Over the course of the next three hours, funding of events by the student body was cited often as students made their case to Kroger, demonstrating the important role student body treasurers play in maintaining our autonomy.

After getting to know the two newcomers during the appointment process, returning treasurer Chris Weber is confident in their abilities to fulfill this role. It is out of the ordinary to replace the majority of treasurers at once and will require both Weber and Chavez-Lopez to serve four semester-long terms apiece, but planning ahead will allow for greater continuity in years to come. Silverton-Peel will serve for three semesters.

“I’ve never heard of any other college where the student body government is able to control where the student body funds are distributed,” says Weber, who has been serving since last spring in the role of assistant treasurer and is starting his first semester primarily in charge of student body funds. “Because of the unique situation,” he says, “the treasurers have a great deal of responsibility to decide where the student body funds are best spent.”

“Both of them going to come to a quick realization that it’s a lot of work,” Weber says, pointing at a stack of filing he was waiting for the new treasurers to help him out with.

Treasurers devote many hours a week to the day-to-day work of making sure all organizations receive their allotted funding, serve on finance and other committees, and have the usual Senate duties. The new treasurers will have to be quickly trained in the system and be efficient, with many student organizations paying out of pocket and needing to be quickly reimbursed by student body funds.

Part of the job of treasurers is to provide money for student endeavors, even if they are one-time events.

With that said, “[what] the two new treasurers are going to have to get used to is saying no,” Weber says. “Understanding they are looking out for what is best for the community as a whole.”

The new treasurers will be thrown into Funding Circus during the first day on the job, when they will decide how much of the Top 40 organizations’ funding requests can be met.
