This week’s meeting was short to allow senators/your beat writers time to grab food between the meeting and the Reed Union. mmm, Tom Yum.

First up, unexpected visitors: Pedal Potential PDX came in asking to advertise off campus for a show on 4/20. Kent Coupe came in to announce that the House of Lords would meet beginning next week, complete with those fly wigs of theirs.

Committee Reports went by quickly. The highlights you say? Well, Schwartz says that the response rate is good for the smoking survey, about 1 in 5 Reedies smokes, and 60% of us are in favor of using SB funds to construct covered spaces for smokers. There will be more info in _the Quest_ about this. Theoretically.

Speaking of smoking, the Health Center wants you to know that they have options to help you kick that dirty dirty habit! Natural options, acupuncture, patches, oh my!

Todd got sunburnt in LA. Serves you right!

There is $4,437.85 left in FC after they gave a mondo chunka change ($6k) to Renn Fayre. HELLZ YES BUY MORE GOLD.

If you wanna play RF Softball, email Meg!

App Comm appointed Schwartz and Gester for student handbook, and Lindsay Dono for Animal Care. Do you get off by getting involved? Apply for Honor Council, Commencement Committee, SIN Webmaster, and BABY MONEY!

Phoebe “$” Koenig says “RUN FOR OFFICE.” Apps are online and in the pdox and outside Commons and the library lobby.

Student Diversity Committee met for the first time and discussed their purpose. They are going to publish a report on the state of diversity at Reed every semester or so.

Weapons Policy!

The higher ups have been concerned about weapons on campus and drafted a Weapons Policy. The draft was handed around but we pretty much tabled discussion until next week so that it could be uninterrupted. Things that would still be allowed: pocket knives and keychain pepper spray and things for classes like ornamental swords. Things that will not be allowed: guns (obvi), paintball guns, large knives, huge tanks of pepper spray. What is this, an airport? What’s next, 4 ounce limits on liquids? Why’s the man taking away our weapons??? Kidding. Maybe. There should be a copy of the draft going out to the student body. If you like/dislike weapons, you should come to the meeting on Monday at 5pm in the SU to discuss.

As always, senate is bored and lonely and wants to hear from YOU! Shoot them an email at [&#x73;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x74;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1] and let them know how you feel about weapons, smoking, sugar daddies, the WNBA, or anything else that gets you going.
