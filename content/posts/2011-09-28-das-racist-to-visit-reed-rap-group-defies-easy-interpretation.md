On September 9<sup>th</sup>, the controversial art rap group Das Racist (DR) will perform in Kaul Auditorium at 8 P.M as the Multicultural Resource Center’s inaugural event of the year. This enigmatic group inspires questions like “what the hell is this song ‘Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell’&#8211; a commentary on American consumerism or a bad joke?” and “does this band want me to dance, to laugh or to join a protest? Can I do all of those things at once?”

The band formed at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where Victor Vazquez (aka Kool A.D.) and Himanshu Suri (aka Heemz) lived together in a “Students of Color for Social Justice” theme dorm. As students of respectively Afrocuban/Italian and Indian descent at a private liberal arts university, the two bonded, and decided to make music that discusses some of the societal problems that they observed in the world. The duo was soon joined by Suri’s fellow Queens, New York resident, hype man Ashok Kondabolu (aka The Honorable Prophet Dapwell).

In 2008 “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” a song which features the repeated phrase “I’m at the Pizza Hut; I’m at the Taco Bell; I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” received viral popularity. Following on this success, in 2010 DR released two mixtapes, “Shut Up, Dude” and “Sit Down, Man.”  These mixtapes show an artistic prowess that some critics had originally doubted. In songs like “Ek Shaneesh,” the rappers’ rhythmic styles bloom, and the lyrical sections cleverly string together references to philosophers, fast food and drugs. But however witty the lyrics may be, the group’s habit of sliding from party mode (“yeah, beers for years”) into social criticism (“Eddie Said speaks… people always follow like dead heads”) and then back can be dizzying. One might still wonder what it all means.

This question of determining DR’s intent is possibly the most puzzling. When the Village Voice asked Vazquez in an online interview what “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” was supposed to mean, he wrote in response: “WHY ARE YOU VALIDATING THE FALSE DICHOTOMY OF JOKES V. SERIOUS SHIT?” Whatever Das Racist’s artistic principles are, they are rock-solid, but they won’t hand them out on a platter.

However, their fans do not mind this at all. Nabeel Arshad of the MRC, who arranged the show, explained that “Das Racist is great because they talk about serious stuff in a not-very-serious manner.” When they discuss the lack of people of color in the entertainment industry, or the ubiquity of fast food and obesity in U.S. society, Das Racist understands the discomfort that they are bound to instill. They balance the human goals of long-term social change and immediate enjoyment, and they accept the discomfort that this combination may bring.

Still, DR are steadfast and they will not let the media tear them down with vapid critiques. In 2009 when cartoonist Farley Katz satirized “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” Vazquez challenged her to a cartoon-off and drew images that mocked both rappers and cartoonists. The next month a New Yorker columnist, Sasha Frere Jones included Das Racist as an example of the demise of hip hop. In response DR co-wrote an article questioning Jones’ authority as a white, educated male in analyzing African-American music.

As they name-drop Joyce, Kierkegard, and Hemingway alongside hip hop greats like A Tribe Called Quest, and Nas, DR certainly stretches the limits of rap subject matter.  “Das Racist,” Arshad stated, “is great for Reed audiences because they are intellectuals. They may not look like intellectuals, but they went to a college very similar to Reed.” “Intellectually” he added, “they have a very different point of view from most Reedies, but in personality they’re probably pretty similar.”

Journalists have described Das Racist everything from “clowns” and “inane” to “deconstructionist” and “transcendental.” Whatever they are, they advocate social change while living the good life. They encourage awareness and dissuade guilt. “I never asked to be born,” they sing. “I don’t owe nobody shit.”
