Greg Eibel’s machining shop is the closest way to experience Olde Reed without a time machine. Eibel’s shop tucked away in the basement of the physics building has remained largely unchanged since the day he began his job as Instrument Machinist in 1975. Students have come and gone, but the same machines line the walls. Even the fluorescent lighting appears to have escaped modernization with a color temperature decidedly more 1975 than 2012. The warm fluorescent lights and large machines have played host to decades of thesising physics students who enter Eibel’s shop with little to no experience with machining, but leave with the unique satisfaction of having brought to fruition a tool created with their hands. The tools that these students produce go on to play vital roles in the completion of their Senior Thesis.

Although Eibel is not a Reed alumnus, he embodies the same creative spirit and quirk that Reedies are renowned for. As a student at Portland State University, a much younger Eibel was running low on money and saw a job posting in the Physics department’s machining shop. Eibel got the job and worked with the head of the shop, Jack Janacek, cleaning machines, organizing the stockrooms, and playing chess. Eibel’s job in the shop quickly developed into a passion that could no longer be satiated with part-time employment: “When I saw what a person could do in a machine shop I was out of that school in two months.” Eibel sheepishly admitted to neglecting to drop his classes when he left Portland State, a decision that he would not recommend Reedies to emulate. Unlike many college dropouts, Eibel was able to find work soon after leaving Portland State. Eibel joined an apprenticeship program at one of the more prestigious machine shops in the Portland area, spending three and a half years as an apprentice and two years as a professional machinist.

A job posting in _The Oregonian_ brought Eibel to Reed. Reed’s physics building was not even a decade old and the machining shop had only recently moved out of Eliot Hall’s basement when Eibel took the helm as the head of the machining shop. Eibel was looking for a position where he would have the opportunity to design equipment in a similar capacity to Jack Janacek, his mentor at Portland State. Reed was at least a partial answer to Eibel’s problem. The position offered Eibel the opportunity to operate his own shop at Reed but required that he assist the physics department and students with their projects. Eibel admits this was not his ideal situation: “I was looking for a job that was 90% machining and design, the job turned out to be 15% machining and design.” Despite his preference for machining over teaching, Eibel says he found that teaching provides its own sense of fulfillment: “It’s always rewarding to have someone come down here to learn something… in that case it’s fantastic.”

Of course, Reed would not allow Eibel to live in the machining shop, so Eibel took it upon himself to construct his own home. According to Eibel, the 70’s were the golden age of do-it-yourself home construction, and “you could obtain free material from tearing down buildings.” Eibel tore down around half a dozen buildings to gather materials to construct his home. Around 75% of his home was constructed from the recycled materials. Recycling derelict buildings and constructing a home was, according to Eibel, “not that difficult.” The home was not Eibel’s only project, he also has “smaller buildings” like garages, workshops, and a vacation home under his belt. With the construction of a home only a small challenge for Eibel, it comes as no surprise that building things “kind of became old.” Eibel dabbled in music to keep himself active, but eventually that hobby ran its course as well. Today, the majority of Eibel’s entertainment is derived from his work in the machining shop, a job that he confesses to still being “totally into.”

Eibel recalls Olde Reed with melancholy: “It seems like we used to have more really weird students&#8230; very bright, but weird.” He notes that today, “much more emphasis is on the money and that the more money you have the better you’re going to get.” This philosophy is not one Eibel agrees with; as he puts it, “Olde Reed people came here because of the environment and the money was secondary.” Regardless, Eibel continues to be amazed by the Reed student’s high motivation and solid work ethic.

Whether or not it was by design, Eibel has preserved the feel of the machining shop. He has continued to create an environment that for decades has played an instrumental role in Reed’s science departments by providing the tools necessary for completing the defining work of every student’s time at Reed: the Senior Thesis. Perhaps more importantly, Eibel has given his students the confidence to learn outside of their fields of interest, opening them to a world beyond the theoretical.
