You may think you know the story of the House of Atreus, but the Reed Theatre production of Ellen McLaughlin’s _Iphigenia and Other Daughters_ will make you think again. The characters of Clytemnestra, Orestes, and Iphigenia all feature prominently in the Western canon (and have/will come up in your Humanities 110 readings). While the script is based on Athenian tragedies, this iteration of the classic shifts the focus to the women in the story: the wife left to rule a kingdom, the daughter left to remember a crime—all of them left to wait.

It was this female perspective that drew Theatre Professor Kathleen Worley to the script. “[McLaughlin is] interested in the ‘subversive feminine narrative,’ “ says Worley, “the people who get left behind, the people about whom the plays and the stories are not written, the people who are the peripheral characters. I also found that interesting.”

When Worley read _Other Daughters_, she was excited to find “good roles for women,” given the number of “strong women” who were acting in Reed productions. The play features five characters from the House of Atreus, with Orestes as the sole male figure, and a chorus of women. To this, Worley has added a male chorus. Since the absence of men onstage is such a crucial element of the story, the director felt that that the contrast could be emphasized by having a chorus of men introduce the play. Chanting in both English and Attic Greek, the male chorus proclaims the belief system of their society, leading with the line “This is the way things are.”

Classics major Lindsay Myers ’12, who wrote her junior qual on _Iphigenia in Tauris_, coached the male chorus on Greek pronunciation. Worley says that both she and Myers had used the concept of weaving in their understanding of the plays.

“People disappear from each others’ lives, they come back,” muses Worley. “There are more layers to be woven together, and more layers to be woven through than I had first realized.”

McLaughlin’s piece reinterprets, in turn, Euripides’ _Iphigenia in Aulis_, Sophecles’ _Electra_, and finally Euripedes’ _Iphigenia in Tauris_. Though the story of the family unfolds chronologically, each of the three sections takes place in a different historical period. It begins in ancient Greece, jumps to the early twentieth century, and the last section occurs, in the director’s words, “in some mythic paradise in which both a statue of Artemis and somebody who appears to be a soldier from the first world war can exist&#8230;In a way, it’s like directing three one-acts.”

Even for one unfamiliar with the original Greek myth, the poetry of McLaughlin’s text delves deep into the hearts of the characters. Alternatively in verse and prose, the emotions contained in the dialogue make the story easily identifiable. At one point, Clytemnestra speaks longingly of Iphigenia:

“I stand in a tree and reach between my legs and there—I have made an egg. It is dove–gray and smooth and its shape is the one true thing in existence. I place it against my cheek. There is the sound of a curved fingernail scratching. She unfurls herself like a sweet pea blossom and stands beside me, tall and breathing. We hold hands.”

The mood evoked by the language demands a set design that is “spare,” according to Peter Ksander, Assistant Professor of Theatre, and the set and lighting designer for the show. He continues, “I think the script requires that. [The set] doesn’t want to be highly ornamented. The language is thick, so to get clarity in it you can’t overly encrust the scenery.”

In contrast, Corrine Larson, Visiting Assistant Professor of Theatre and costume designer for _Other Daughters_, has drawn from the neoclassical fashion of the time between the world wars. She says that her design is not really “referencing the classics, but referencing how other people have referenced the classics.”

Choreography by dance-theatre major Claire Thomforde-Garner ’12 also draws on neoclassical aesthetics, incorporating influences from the work of renowned turn-of-the-century choreographer Isadora Duncan and her version of resurrecting Greek movement.

The designers had considered situating the production in a more recent period – what if the soldier’s uniform was from Desert Storm rather than the First World War? “Peter [Ksander] pointed out that we’ve always been at war, we just don’t realize it,” says Larson of their decision to stick to the period indicated in the script. “War has happened all the time, and this is the story of the people who stay home for the war.”

This production is poignant not just because of the timelessness of the story, but because of the care it takes in examining the decisions of these familiar characters.  Think again.

_Iphigenia and Other Daughters_ opens Friday night.
