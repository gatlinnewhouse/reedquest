Having been a member of senate for the past year (as the secretary), I have spent a lot of time listening, typing and taking a lot in, but not getting a chance to project outwardly my own ideas. I know the ins and outs of how senate works, and I now want to use this valuable experience of the last year to become more involved: with a voice and a vote.

I understand the importance of keeping a strong relationship with the administration in order to maintain a cooperative atmosphere in which productive and fair conversations thrive, but I also understand the need for student autonomy. I would like to use my position on senate to get the students’ voices heard.

Not to mention, at the end of this year, we are losing two valuable women senators and myself, the ONLY THREE WOMEN senate has. I believe it’s really important to keep some women’s voices on senate so the student body is not comprised entirely of views from only one sex. As a student body that prides itself on advocating for and maintaining gender equality, I feel that it is important for the student government to reflect that sense of equality through the composition of its representative members. My point is—vote for me because I’m a bad a$$ female. If you’re at all confused about the point I’m making, I’d strongly recommend that you listen to “Run the World” by Beyoncé.

Bottom line: I truly care about Reed. Quite frankly, I wouldn’t be running if I didn’t absolutely care so much that I want to spend another term defending issues important to the student body. Thanks.

[P.S. Side note: As the current secretary, I am fully aware that many conversations can go in circles and that sometimes, if given a chance, people can talk and talk and talk. With myself as a senator, you can count on me to be respectful of when a topic needs attention, but also aware of when a conversation needs to come to a close and a decision needs to be made.]

Hi! I’m Adrian, a junior biochemistry major, and I want to be your senator! I’ve spent the past two years on Honor Council, this past year serving as the Chair of Education. From that, I am completely confident interacting with the administration and other student groups, and have a complete understanding of how things “work” at Reed. I’ve read just about every code/policy out there, and have had countless conversations about Honor, apathy, the administration, and more. Additionally, I’ve been at every senate meeting for the past four semesters, meaning I know what’s going on in Senate right now AND two years ago.

<div>
  What do I want to do on Senate? First, I want to reform the Dog Policy. As a Reed dog owner, I see a huge opportunity to create a honorable policy that is accommodating for both dog-haters and dog-lovers. Secondly, I want to explore alternative means for student input that aren’t showing up to a Senate meeting. From my experience on Honor Council, I have learned that just because Reedies don’t show up to events, that definitely doesn’t mean they don’t care, and I want to make sure that every opinion is heard and considered. Lastly, as we all sense the change afoot, I’ll work my hardest to make sure that the student body has a say in what the future of Reed holds.

Hi, I’m Danielle, and LET’S CUT TO THE CHASE. Here are some bullet points to avoid eyeball-glazing and page skimming.

So, I’m qualified to be a Senator because…

  * _I already go to Senate meetings_, which is unheard of for many non-returning Senate candidates! I have a strong understanding of how Senate works and what the role of a senator is. Spoiler alert: Senators actually do things.
  * _I’m involved in Student Body life_. I’m an HA and I work on some Res Life committees, so I know how to communicate with both Reedies and Reed’s administrative bodies. I also do KRRC and RCCR, so woop woop for arty student things.
  * _I like Reed_, and I probably like you. Any Reedie who knows me will tell you that I’m down to have a conversation with just about anyone. I’m interested in hearing what you want from your senators.

What would I (specifically)do if you voted for me for Senate?

  * _I would change Senate meetings!_ Stopping by the SU on a Friday afternoon for Senate feels like going to a conference when you haven’t done the reading. It took me at least two meetings until I understood how the “stack” worked. If elected to Senate, I would encourage Senators to succinctly summarize and provide enough background information for the average, uninvolved student to understand the discussion.
  * _I would encourage new office hours!_ Senators should hold office hours for students to come talk about what it means to be a senator, why student involvement matter, and how to get sh*t done while navigating bureaucratic nonsense. Will these office hours be weekly, monthly, quarterly? I don’t know, but some personal presence is better than none.
  * _I would put Senate stuff on the Internet._ I realize that it is a work in progress, but SIN is a hot mess (sorry John Iselin) and not a reasonable source for the student body to use. Easy, accessible online information and forums would allow for more virtual student involvement in Senate affairs and a more informed presence at Senate meetings.

Questions, comments, compliments? Flag me down in person or email me (djuncal AT reed DOT edu). Fight ~\*student apathy\*~ and vote for Danielle M. Juncal.

i feel like most senate blurbs ive read in here have talked about wanting to make senate more exciting or relevant or bring in more community involvement or something. i dont want to make some stupid claim like that. instead my platform is one of confidence. i am running as the sort of candidate that you can count on to stand up for the student body. there are a lot of questions regarding the relationship between the student body and the administration during this year&#8217;s regime change and as a senior i am well equipped to deal with this. as a junior i have seen olde reed die a few times and as such ive seen things that work and things that dont. as a senator i will work my hardest to preserve the best parts of the school.

Hey, I’m Theodore Landsman and I’m running for Senate. I love Reed and I’d love to get a chance to improve it by serving as one of your Senators.  I think Senate is run really well as is, I don’t have any sweeping reforms I want to implement or new directions I want to take it in, but there are a few areas where I think Senate can do more.

I want to be part of the conversation with the administration about recent crackdowns and policy revisions concerning Reeds alcohol and other drugs policy. Changes in how government outside of Reed and the Reed administration treat the Reed community have forced us to reconsider how Alcohol and other drug usage affects the campus and to what extent drug use violates the honor principle. Some of these changes are inevitable, but some have gone to far. I believe Senate needs to take the initiative and outline what we consider acceptable and unacceptable steps for the administration to take in its mission to curb drug culture at Reed.

I’d also like to see what can be improved about wifi and printing around campus. These systems are extremely well run be computer user services, but only seem to get maintained when something goes majorly wrong.  As someone with experience maintaining these systems, I have some ideas as to what can be done to keep students involved and alerting C.U.S. to these mishaps, and more simple problems like paper and ink refills.

I’d like to see student government participation higher across the board. This is difficult to impossible when systems like SIN are broken, and while some steps have already been taken to bring it back online, a revamped, functional SIN with an improved interface could make a major difference in campus involvement. While student involvement seems to already be resurging, I’d like to see Senate channel that involvement into more forums and more regular forums. Many of the clashes between the student body and the administration recently have been cause by a feeling of powerlessness within the student body, a more empowered and informed student body can more effectively demand change and channel this perceived powerlessness into productive discourse.

Finally, because despite all of these lofty goals I have no intention of taking myself too seriously, if elected I promise I will wear the golden hot pants to at least one senate meeting. Thank you for your consideration.

Hey all! I’m Rennie, an Environmental Studies – History sophomore with a penchant for campus involvement, ceramics, and long walks on the beach. I’m finding it very hard to write this blurb – it’s a blurb, it should be as casual as the word describing it sounds.<sup>1</sup> In my other attempts to write something about this election I ended up with a poem in iambic pentameter, if that’s any indicator of how hard I’ll try, at least.<sup>2</sup> Instead, here’s what you need to know about me as a candidate for Student Senator:

  1. I’ve attended Senate meetings since the end of last year, and am up-to-date with current events (as much as one can be when you aren’t in fact a senator); senate needs people who’ll work hard and commit to advocating for the student body. I’m not only prepared but excited to take on what senate needs done beyond my own platform.
  2. I have experience working both with Res Life and Student Services as a House Advisor and Gray Fund intern, respectively. I have a good idea of Reed’s administrative structure/bureaucracy.
  3. I want to improve Reed’s approach to on-campus sustainability, and while I have my own ideas regarding projects also want to revive Sustainability Committee to make funds available to students. I firmly believe that our sustainability efforts are bound to the Honor Principle.
  4. I’m optimistic, friendly, and always willing to listen. Lauren Cooper says I’m “certified chill,” which I imaging might be nice to bring to the table if meetings get intense.

Have questions, concerns, or ideas? You’ll learn infinitely more about me, my campaign, and how I can help you in person, so stop me if you see me around (wave down the girl who is apparently physically incapable of wearing pants) or email her at rmeyers AT reed DOT edu.

1. Point of interest: The OED says that the word “Blurb” was first used in 1907 to describe Ms. Betty Blurb, a “pulchritudinous” (a.k.a. sexyfine) woman drawn next to the sensational language used on book jackets.

2. The Poem in Question:
  
To you dear Reedies I present these facts:
  
A politician must have ample tact;
  
But more than that a knowledge of the scene
  
In such I’m set, to senate I have been
  
A multitude of times – and then what’s more
  
I’ve worked for Student Services before.
  
I give a shit so, hey, that could be new
  
But senators et al. are not the few
  
People here who desire something to do.
  
So vote for me, R. Meyers, if you please
  
To attack our admin’s indolencies.

Hey I’m Lina. I’m only a freshman but I’ve already seen major changes made to the Reed community: the pool hall is practically smoke-free, Resident Directors can give out AODs, and Paideia-gate put student autonomy into question. We are in a time of change. Next year, in addition to President Kroger’s strategic planning campaign, the senate will undergo reviews of both the AOD and sexual misconduct policies, providing us with a unique opportunity to make profound changes to our school. I am eager to be apart of that process. I am running for senate because I want to ensure that while we adopt and adjust these major policies, Reed maintains the culture and sense of tradition that makes it unique, a sentiment sometimes lost in favor of the administration’s legal responsibilities and monetary ambitions.

****I am Ted. I am a sophomore Math-Economics major who is running for Senate due to my erotically intense love of freedom and autonomy. I&#8217;ve run/been involved with running/helped run ARG, Tir na Nog and Karma Patrol over the course of the past two years, so I have a decent amount of experience poking Reed bureaucracy with a stick and seeing if it twitches. As a senator I would hopefully be able to poke with a sharper stick and therefore be better able to help people get what they want out of Reed bureaucracy. Also, I would put a chicken in every pot, make Bon Appetit food free, and make every qual as easy as the Econ qual.

Reasons to RE-ELECT me for another term on Senate:

1. I know how to get shit done. From my past three years at Reed, and this full year on Senate, I&#8217;ve gained a lot of useful institutional knowledge and memory.

2. I put in place two very important environmental initiatives this semester: composting in the Language Houses and Apartments, and the new Student Sustainability Coordinator position.

3. I worked toward (and succeeded at) filling every open student body position this semester as AppComm Chair.

4. I&#8217;m creating online student body forums for housing, lost, and found, so that we can fiiiiiinally reclaim Missed Connections.

5. I&#8217;m going to push for dog policy reform, and work to revise the new DHSM (Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct) policy.

and the MOST IMPORTANT REASON:

6. I care about you and I care about Reed, and I don’t want us to become another cookie-cutter school. Let’s fuck shit up, y’all. I&#8217;m fighting for YOU.

I believe in sustainable, efficient, and autonomous student government. Specifically, I believe that there should be a clear separation of powers between the administration and the student body, and that effective institutions should be in place to maintain those separations. Last semester I sought to create durable accessible bike storage on campus. Unfortunately I was met with bureaucratic ambiguities and distinct lack of student involvement in the campus physical improvement process. In response I would like to create a student body organization that works directly with the administration in the hopes of creating sustainable lasting solutions to problems including but not limited to bike storage and public smoking. Thank you, and please remember to vote.

The student body&#8217;s passionate response to the administration&#8217;s continual abuse of power is inspirational. It showcases our community&#8217;s devotion to self-governance. When students wear &#8220;unregulated depressant&#8221; pins, pack discussions on autonomy and loudly indict President Kroger, it is demonstration of our unwavering commitment to our ability to self-organization. When we assert that we, the students, have a better understanding of how to solve our issues than the Reed administration, we also assert that we can take up the mantle of responsibility.  We&#8217;ve largely failed in this respect. The anonymity provided by online social networks has revealed our communities  cleavage points: race, class and gender. It has also revealed the stressors which plague the student body: insecurities, anxieties, depression and alienation. It is time that we took up the mantle of responsibility and discussed the problems posed by these stressors on a public platform that is only allowed to us because of the principle of student autonomy. We should use our student government to foster community that we continually neglect when we allow concerns about racism, classism and sexism to descend into unconstructive dialogue on anonymous channels. We know that we cannot rely on established institutions alone to solve these problems as the administration has shown a degree of ignorance on these issues, as indicated by the tokenistic advertisement of “diversity”. Yet this does not mean we should avoid cooperation with the administration as they provide a supporting institutional framework through the MRC and the HCC. It is my goal to coordinate with student groups and the administration to host a series of Reed Union discussions on race, class, gender and issues of mental health to foster increased understanding of these issues. These forums will not only foster a spirit of community and tolerance but give us a sense of how we can fine-tune services to meet student needs. Our adherence to autonomy and self-determination implies taking up a large set of obligations and responsibilities. In order to fully commit to the principle of student autonomy, we need to not only be reactive to the needs of the student body but proactive. It’s time we used the student government to attend to neglected community needs instead of sequestering dissent and complaints to anonymous venues. Vote for me if you believe we can use the principle of student autonomy to further substantive change in our community.
