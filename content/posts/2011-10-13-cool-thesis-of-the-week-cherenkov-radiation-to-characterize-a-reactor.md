Reed&#8217;s research nuclear reactor has tons of cool features. Its core contains 3,000 grams of uranium-235, and it can put out as much as 250 kilowatts. However, one feature is probably the coolest: When brought up to power, the water around the reactor core emits a blue glow. This glow, called Cherenkov radiation, is the subject of Ahmad Shabbar&#8217;s thesis.

Ahmad, a Physics senior from Karachi, Pakistan, will use information about the Reed Research Reactor&#8217;s Cherenkov radiation to characterize the makeup of the reactor&#8217;s core. He hopes to collect data on the frequency and intensity of the blue light the reactor emits to work backwards and figure out the power of output from the reactor&#8217;s core. He will be helped in this endeavor by Melinda Krahenbuhl and Reuven Lazarus, the reactor&#8217;s directors, who will be helping him with the science behind the reactor; Bob Ormond, who will be helping with electronics and experimental equipment; and his advisor, Professor David Latimer, who will help with the physics.

> “Beta particles travel faster than the speed of light underwater. Cherenkov radiation is like a sonic boom for light.”

Ahmad, who has been licensed as a Reactor Operator since June 2009 and as a Senior Reactor Operator since May 2010, recalls that watching the Cherenkov radiation was one of the first things he fell in love with about the reactor. When the reactor is brought up to power and the lights are dimmed in the reactor bay, an “eerie blue glow” arises around the core of the reactor from deep in the water pool in which the core sits. “It is, perhaps, the coolest thing I have ever seen,” Ahmad says, “and it is still as exciting as it was the first time.” He explains that knowing the sub-atomic science behind the phenomenon is part of the attraction. The glow, which is named after physicist Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov, is actually a product of the light itself in the reactor pool. When neutrons begin to bounce around in the reactor core, beginning the reaction process, they hit the nuclei of uranium atoms, causing fission, or the splitting apart of the uranium nuclei. The fragments of the broken nuclei, or fission products, then emit Beta particles, which are high-energy electrons. “The Beta particles actually travel faster than the speed of light,” Ahmad explains, emphasizing that this is only possible because it is occurring underwater. The Beta particles polarize the water molecules around them, which then need to emit energy. This energy is emitted in the form of blue photons—the visual evidence of Cherenkov radiation. “In simple terms,” Ahmad explains, “it&#8217;s like a sonic boom for light.”

Ahmad will observe specific aspects of this light for evidence of what is going on behind it. He will set up optic fibers a foot or two from the reactor core (any closer would run the risk of turning them radioactive), which will run to an amplifier and a photo detector. These will record the frequency of the light (exactly what shade of blue it is) as well as its intensity (how bright it is). From the light&#8217;s frequency, Ahmad says he can figure out at what energy the water molecules got excited. From this, the energy of the Beta particles that excited them can be determined. From the light&#8217;s intensity, Ahmad will derive the number of Beta particles. “From there,” Ahmad says, “we should be able to figure out the number of fission fragments and the energies they were at.” Finally, Ahmad can reach his final destination: the power at which the reactor operates. With the right calculations, Ahmad should end up at the approximate power he already knows the reactor to be putting out.

“It&#8217;s very ambitious,” Ahmad says, but he feels up to the challenge. “The reactor is the reason why I came to Reed,” he says, and its Cherenkov radiation “was always the most fascinating thing” to look at. However, Ahmad knows there must be more to it that a pretty blue glow, and this is where his science comes in. “There should be something useful about it,” he concludes, “it can&#8217;t be just light.”
