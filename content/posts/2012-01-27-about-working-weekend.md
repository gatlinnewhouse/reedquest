        <em>Working Weekend starts Friday, February 3 and ends Sunday, February 5.</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We wanted to write to say a few words directly to the students about the inspiration for the upcoming Working Weekend, and the vision behind it, and to ask you to consider joining us.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The inspiration came from conversations among a few Reed alumni earlier this year, wherein we concluded that what sets Reed apart is a culture which infects each one of you over the course of your time at Reed, and to which you were predisposed by self-selecting Reed.  It&#8217;s a culture of passion and first principles and idiosyncrasy and a lot of other things we could spend hours debating on the SU porch.  It&#8217;s a culture that has been passed down from generation to generation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We can tell you from experience that each time you meet a Reedie, anywhere in the world and years after leaving 3203 SE Woodstock behind, there is a flash of recognition, a quiet nod to that special culture.  And it seems to us that, as a tribe, we, the alumni have been failing you, the students, a little bit, because the transition to life beyond Reed is not always easy, and some of the challenges and solutions are recurring and common to many Reedies.  With this in mind, we wanted to at least try to reach out, across the years, and over the few days on campus, to offer suggestions about things like where the potholes are on a certain road, or how and when to countersteer in your career.  For the alumni who are coming, that is what the upcoming Working Weekend is about.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Think about sticking your head into a few of the sessions?  There will be one-on-one &#8216;office hours&#8217; where you can meet privately with the participating alum, as well as expertise panel discussions, a &#8216;startup lab&#8217; to explore your ideas, and plenty of Q/A time so you can ask us whatever is on your mind.  We are there for one reason:  to help you build the life and career you want.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Will you let us help?  We&#8217;d love to see you.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Sincerely,
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Adam Riggs and Forrest Alogna, &#8217;95

        (and the nearly 100 other accomplished and committed alumni returning to campus for Working Weekend)
