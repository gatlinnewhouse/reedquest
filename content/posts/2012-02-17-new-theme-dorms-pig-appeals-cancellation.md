Three new theme dorms were announced last Thursday: literature, art, and circus. After deliberation by Residence Life Committee, which includes several Housing Advisers, a Resident Director, and Student Body Vice President Aidan Sigman ’13, all of the current dorms were renewed with the exception of People Ingesting Gourmet (PIG). Decisions were made based on new guidelines from Residence Life and input from Community Safety, Residence Life, and the custodial staff.

Rennie Meyers ’15, coordinator of the new literature theme dorm, Random House, hopes to develop a community dedicated to expanding its literary horizons and engaging with texts as a group. The dorm will hold monthly book groups led by roommate pairs on a book of their choosing. Any member of the Reed community is welcome to join if they do the reading. Other possible events for the floor include a Great Gatsby-themed dinner and dance and an Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery night. Random House is to be located in Old Dorm Bloc, a location Meyers wanted for its old-world-library atmosphere.

The coordinators of the art and circus theme dorms are currently contemplating fusion of the two dorms. Julia Selker ’15, a coordinator for the art dorm, was disappointed by the lack of a communal art space at Reed. She found that materials, tools, and workspace were hard to come by outside of a classroom environment. Selker, and her co-coordinator Liana Clark ’15, hope the dorm will facilitate creativity in the Student Body. Inspired by the street art craze, Selker and Clark’s ideas for activities include yarn bombing, a form of street art that uses knitted or crocheted fabric instead of paints or chalk, and paint fights. Papier-mâché is another medium Selker and Clark would like the dorm to explore. Selker said she envisioned “crazy people doing crazy stuff.”

PIG was informed that its gourmet theme would not be renewed for next year. Sigman, a member of the Residence Life Committee, said that during the approval process the committee asked itself, “Is someone who reads the description of the dorm going to be satisfied with the actual day-to-day life?” While problems with AOD violations and complaints from custodial staff about the conditions of the PIG kitchen also affected the decision, the committee generally felt that there was too large a disconnect between the written plan and actual behavior that had been witnessed in the dorm this past semester. Sigman said he thought it was “certainly unfortunate to cut a theme dorm.”

Some members of the PIG feel the decision to discontinue the dorm is extreme. Noah Atchison ’15, a prospective PIG theme coordinator for next year, said he “has never seen as close and tight a community before.” The dorm has not had an AOD violation since October. On Wednesday prospective theme coordinators Atchinson and Aaron McCray-Goldsmith ’14 had a meeting with their RD and discussed some issues they believe Residence Life may have overlooked. McCray-Goldsmith said the meeting was “very satisfactory.” The dorm may receive the opportunity to have its application re-reviewed.
