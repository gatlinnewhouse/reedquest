    Reedies&#8217; romantic longings and lost items are in Eva Wiedmann&#8217;s &#8217;14 hands.

Sunday nights, Eva Wiedmann sits in the library on one of the couches and compiles Missed Connections. She’s been in charge of the fate of the romantic longings, lost items and swap of belongings of Reed students since the beginning of this year.

She says she likes being insider to the communication needs of the student body: “It’s nice getting emails throughout the day from people asking for Missed Connections. I know they’re not for me, but they make me happy to see everyone’s communications with each other.”

She got the job when the senior who compiled Missed Connections last year sent out a Missed Connection herself asking for a replacement.

“I sent in this really heartfelt email about how I loved reading Missed Connections and I felt like I had this special connection with them, and I really wanted to keep them going,” Wiedmann says. “She sent out this email to everyone who had answered saying that she was just going to pick the name out of a hat. But I did end up getting it, and she told me she had really just chosen me because she’d liked my email, but didn’t want people to be upset about it.”

While Wiedmann could have changed the formatting of Missed Connections, she decided there was no point in changing something that works.

If Wiedmann doesn’t get any romantic Missed Connections, she puts a couple in herself. “I just want to keep the ball rolling, and so if no one’s making any romantic connections, I summarize the plot of a Disney movie or something, or just put in something really innocuous and small to keep people interested. Sometimes if there aren’t many Missed Connections at all I put in some silly ones too.”

People tend to use Missed Connections as a kind of jury-rigged electronic lost and found, but Wiedmann doesn’t think of this as a problem that needs to be remedied.

“I put out a Missed Connection last semester asking if people wanted some other kind of space for lost and found, and people didn’t really seem to mind it,” Wiedmann says. “There’s few enough now that it doesn’t overwhelm it, and if the lost and found ones were taken out there would hardly be any Missed Connections at all.”

Last semester, Wiedmann received over two hundred Missed Connections; she hopes she is doing a good job of keeping the tradition alive.

Lately, there have been some hostile Missed Connections. Wiedmann doesn’t want to have to decide which ones make it into SB info and which don’t.

“When I was given this position, there was no honor training or whatnot in regards to how to go about the Missed Connections,” Wiedmann says. “I feel it is not my place to editorialize. I&#8217;ve always taken myself to act as a system: input-output. I do wish that the Missed Connections were entirely absent of hateful comments, but I do not think it is my responsibility to regulate that. I would be happy to do so, however I&#8217;d want to hear from people first that that is in fact what they want.”

Student Body President Ari Galper feels the same way as Wiedmann: “I usually don’t read the Missed Connections before putting them into SB info, and I don’t want to screen them, but I won’t hesitate to take out any ad hominem attacks. Missed Connections should not be used for Reedies to say harmful things about each other.”

But this is an issue concerning the seedy underbelly of Missed Connections, not the bulk of them. Wiedmann prefers the more romantic side of her job. She says that she is: “kind of a diehard romantic so I love helping others.” But her favorite part of it isn’t the romance.

“I especially like the Missed Connections that are stuff like, ‘you hugged me yesterday, I really appreciated it’ and things like that &#8211; one student reaching out the another for the positive impact they made in a small way. Reed can be a little much sometimes, and it’s nice to see that despite it all, people still care and want to be in contact with each other.”
