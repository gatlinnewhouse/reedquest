As many of you are aware, a community member filed a Title IX complaint with the college in relation to the events that traditionally occur on the first day of Hum 110 lecture. We cannot at this time address the specifics of the case, but we support people who stand up for themselves and what they believe, and we hope that the dialogue around this event remains respectful and honorable towards all sides. We would also like to take this opportunity to remind the community that while a Title IX complaint may be an appropriate way to approach this problem, the Honor Process is another valid way to deal with this issue. Honor Council offers as a resource the Community Rights Subcommittee, or CRS. CRS allows for the possibility that a case may impact the entire community, and if a case is filed, the CRS chair will go through the Honor Process on behalf of the community. Additionally, the Honor Council is committed to fostering a community that freely and openly expresses ideas and opinions, and in order to do this, we frequently hold forums to solicit community feedback and discussion. We are ready and willing to host a forum on this subject if the community feels this is important to discuss in a group setting. Finally, we would like to remind everyone that keeping the dialogue surrounding this complaint open and respectful is key to the Honor Principle, and we would be happy to discuss any comments or frustrations community members might have.
