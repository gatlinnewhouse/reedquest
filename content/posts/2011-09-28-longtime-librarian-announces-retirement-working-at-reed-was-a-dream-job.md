In an email to the Reed community last Tuesday, President Diver announced that Norman F. Carrigg College Librarian Vickie Hanawalt would retire after 25 years in August 2012. The college will select a search committee “in the near future” to find a successor.

Hanawalt came to Reed in 1987 after working at the University of California at Berkeley. During her time here, Reed has been through six presidents and numerous deans, expanded the library multiple times, and switched from an old-fashioned card catalogue to a modern digital system.

During her tenure, Hanawalt represented Reed on the council of the Orbis Cascade Alliance, a network of university libraries in the Pacific Northwest. Orbis administrates both Summit and the Northwest Digital Archives, a collection of primary sources, including photographs, letters, and diaries relating to the Pacific Northwest. Hanawalt predicts that the future of libraries will involve much more networking and digital archiving of this kind, with the goal of eliminating redundancy in library systems as much as possible.

Asked about her most memorable experience while working at the library, Hanawalt recalled a time several months after her hiring when she noticed the smell of smoke. Thinking the building she was newly in charge of was burning down, she hastily called security, only for a student to approach and admit that he&#8217;d burned his toast. “I hadn&#8217;t realized the library was filled with incendiary devices,” she recalled. She says she has discouraged cooking in the library since then.

Hanawalt calls being the college librarian “a dream job.” ****“Reed&#8217;s the best”, she said, adding that Reedies “value the library as an important part of their Reed experience.” While the library itself has changed, she says, the support from the college, the engaged students and faculty, and the “talented and dedicated” library staff have remained constant.

In her retirement, Hanawalt looks forward to actually getting a chance to use some of the resources she administrated for so long, and says she is considering going back to school. Beyond the academic sphere, she says she looks forward to spending more time gardening and being with her family.

What advice does she have for current and future Reedies? “Enjoy it while you&#8217;re here. Four years is a lot shorter than 25 years, and even 25 goes by quickly.”
