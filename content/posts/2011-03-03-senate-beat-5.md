The meeting started out wet ‘n’ wild: Celia’s bottle of TJ’s sparkling limey water wildly sprayed everywhere, distracting Cori from her notes and the rest of senate from their bidness. Luckily, they had no bidness&#8230; LOLz.

**Part I: Committee Reports, HO!**

Diversity Committee is in contact with a buncha people including Louis Melendez (why was this committee started?) and Pancho Savery.

JCDubs wants YOU to apply for theme dorms and language houses. And wants YOU to take the Honor Council survey (<http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/reedhonor>).

Aidan talked to a buncha people. SCAPP is busy talking about faculty leaves and sabbaticals. He talked to Conference and Events Planning (holla) about a buncha things. including how J-Board might be able to use video conference their for meetings. The Performing Arts Center will be ground-broken (that sound you just heard? a million English majors cringing at once) at reunions and the two year construction period of phase one is slated to be done in August 2013. Sleep tight, Anna Mann.

DAzrael wants to help the BPR fix up their drums.

Finance Committee funded a buncha shit. They have $18,105.55 left to spend on your awesome shit.

Huge Renn Fayre News: Black Lodge will be in the Gym. Holyfuckwhat?! Also, project apps are out in the fundome and Pdoxes and the RF office!! Go make awesome shit while we mainline 5-hour energy and pump out theses. Just be aware that all structures will be inspected by someone on Thursday night, so don’t take shortcuts and make shit unstable.

Meg delivered the most shocking news of the evening: Dax “The Situation” King will be leaving us for greener pastures. After Friday, if you have points, no one will be able to help you over here.

Todd whined enough to get spoons back in Pdoxes, but the managers still refuse to offer Newport Reds. Also, are you a signator of a student space that wants a computer? Get in contact with GaronT and he’ll hook it up. The PPR and BHI already got theirs..

Congrats to Andrew Choi and Nick Pittman who were appointed to GF Committee. Wanna get a shoutout? Apply for Nitrogen Day Czar, Elections Czar, Diversity Committee, and Student Wage Review Board!

**Part II: “Real Business”**

Meg “ThrillKillChillhouse” Millhouse wants to look into putting a cap on the amount of money in the Sustainability’s Trust Slush Discretionary Fund so that when the fund is large, the student body fees can be dumped into Top 40 or Finance Committee instead of just deepening the pool of unused monies. Senator Carlisle wants to put more emphasis on making more sustainable projects happen. GaronT feels like the 30 packs of lightbulbs the committee bought last year with the funds were good enough.

Torra “Big Cheese” Money brought up petty cash for discussion. Basically, Senate can request that student groups make revenue, however all revenue MUST be returned to the treasury or student body. Some events that make revenue are lectures or concerts where Reedies get in free, but we charge outsiders, but the student body also makes money from t-shirt sales (Fetish Ball in the past, Renn Fayre, etc). Basically, how do we make sure student groups don’t skim off the top? How do we make sure they don’t lose the monies? Money is talking about making an official form to go along with revenue collection.

Schwartz and Phoebe are looking into SBFees. Should they be raised? lowered? kept the same? Right now, you pay $130 a semester which comes back to you in the form of Renn Fayre, wings, concerts, couch see-saws, etc. Senate had a really hard time this semester in Funding Hell, and were only saved when the Business Office gave them around $10,000 in old SB fees (i.e., not this semester’s fees). Last time the fee was raised was two years ago, and most of it was eaten up by wage increases to student body positions. Basically, they’re gonna review past records and wait to see what the Wage Review Board comes up with before making a recommendation to Senate.

\*gavel gavel\* Meeting adjourned.

**Part III: Real Bidness**
