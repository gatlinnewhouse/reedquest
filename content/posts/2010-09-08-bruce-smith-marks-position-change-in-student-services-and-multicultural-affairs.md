    Bruce Smith joins Reed as the Assistant Dean for Inclusion, Engagement and Success.

This summer, Student Services announced that the newly created position of Assistant Dean of Student Services for Inclusion, Engagement, and Student Success had been filled by Bruce Smith. This position emerges as a result of changes made to Student Services, among them a restructuring of the department that did not include the Office of the Assistant Dean of Multicultural Affairs.

The appointed Dean, Bruce Smith, came to Reed in early August and has since begun to examine issues pertaining to multiculturalism and inclusivity on campus. While it is still unclear how this position will differ from its predecessor, Smith seems to have a clear vision of how he would like to affect the Reed community. Since arriving, he has been meeting with students on campus and also led this week’s Tuesday Talk in the Student Center.

He comes to Reed from Colorado State, where he served as Director of Black/African American Cultural Center for the past year. Before Colorado State, Smith served as the Director of African American Affairs at the University of Arizona. “It’s been a goal to be an educator at each of these positions,” he says. “Teaching is a part of who I am. I want to bring that teacher role to the work I do in Student Services.”

On how he intends to extend this goal of teaching to his new position in Student Services, Smith says, “It’s important that we [in the department] get in front of folks and have as many conversations as possible.” Smith adds that “we want to have as many relationships with students, staff, and faculty as possible and have many dialogues with these people.”

When asked about his responsibilities in this new position, Smith explains, “I think the overall responsibility is to ensure that there are no identity-related barriers to success on this campus. Our goal isn’t to remove these barriers, but it is to help students navigate them.” Smith indicated that these responsibilities are primarily centered around “helping students, faculty, and staff develop communities on campus.”

However, Smith acknowledged that this position also comes with a responsibility to foster “inclusion,” “engagement,” and “success.” He describes one of his primary goals at Reed as inclusivity. “We want to include everyone, folks of all identities, whether we’re talking about racial identities, gender identities, or other marginalized identities. We want to include all those folks in the conversations that we have around building communities on this campus.”

The “conversations” Smith talks about reflect his ideas about student engagement on campus. “We feel that in order for students to have really meaningful collegiate experiences, they have to be engaged in the campus in some way. What I tell people is that if they really want to get their money’s worth [out of college], they need to engage people on all corners of this campus.” Smith intends to facilitate this through his position.

Smith is also quick to recognize his position as the inheritor of the Office of Multicultural Affairs at Reed.

He says he is aware of the state of limbo in which Multicultural Affairs found itself after the previous Dean of Multicultural Affairs, Rhea Combs, found a new job.

Responding to the notion that Multicultural Affairs has been dissolved, Smith is quick to say that Multicultural Affairs office is alive and well. He describes the renaming of the position as reflective of his personal vision. “When we think of Multicultural Affairs, we think of underrepresented identity groups. We are still very concerned with those students.”

However, he says, “We’re also concerned with other students. We want to help all of these students come together to create an inclusive learning community on campus. And if you want to do that, we have to engage with the entire campus—and the words ’inclusion,’ ‘engagement,’ and ‘success’ better represent those goals.”

Smith argues that this belief is a part of his overall approach toward diversity-related issues. For that reason, he also does not like the term “diversity.” “I have a lot of trouble with the word ‘diversity’ because people often say ‘person x comes from a diverse background.’ That often means that they’re a person of color or they’re gay. And to me, they are people who have come from backgrounds where they’ve had integrated experiences.”

According to Smith, diversity is not fully reflective of these ‘integrated experiences,’ which he describes as situations “where you’ve talked with people who don’t look like you, people who don’t believe like you, people who don’t be like you.” Smith believes that bringing these experiences to the table is essential to the position.

Furthermore, he believes that this makes him the right choice for the job. “Even before I started working here, the term I used [instead of diversity] was ‘inclusion.’ That’s why I think I’m the perfect person for this job—my goals around what others around here see as ‘diversity’ are actually about inclusion too.”

Bruce Smith’s office is located on the second floor of Eliot. He plans to make himself accessible to the wider Reed community through the Multicultural Resource Center, now located in the Student Center, and events hosted Student Services.
