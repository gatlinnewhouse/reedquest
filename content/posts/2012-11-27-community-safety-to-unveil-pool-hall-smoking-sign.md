Last week, Vice President Ed McFarlane received a letter from the Multnomah County Department of Health. The Department of Health had received an anonymous complaint about smoking in the pool hall, which is illegal in any indoor area. This will add fuel to the fire that is the debate about smoking in the GCC pool hall.

If it seems like the smoking has come under fire more recently, it’s by design. It has become a bigger deal, “partly because I’ve made it a bigger deal”, said Community Safety Director Gary Granger. According to him, about 25% of the time a CSO looks into the Pool hall, there’s someone smoking there.

This week, Granger will be unveiling new “no smoking” signs in the pool hall. “I needed a ‘no smoking’ sign that didn’t say &#8216;no&#8217;” said Granger. Working with CSO Paul “Tall Pawl” O’Connor, they designed a sign that they hoped would show Pool hall users that the CSO’s were being thoughtful in their approach to curtail smoking. The sign features a Griffin carrying of a student with a cigarette in their hand, the caption reads; “Don’t get carried away! If you must… Smoke’ em outside.”

Granger hopes that instead of using standard off-the-shelf “no smoking” signs, pool hall smokers will see the custom signage and feel that Community Safety cares about them. He also hopes that if non-smokers are bothered by smokers, then “people will have something to point to.” Currently there are no signs in the pool hall as smoking signs are not required to be on the inside of buildings, only at entrances. Community Safety is also working with the Pool hall managers to place the signs in areas that won&#8217;t cover up graffiti.

Granger also shared his thoughts about the larger issue of determining how smokers can co-exist with non-smokers that doesn’t violate the Honor Principle. He said that smoking in the Pool hall “is gonna have to become Olde Reed”. He assured me that smoking there will inevitably have to come to an end, much to the dismay of some students. “What people need to understand is,” he said, “is that the course is not going to change.” Attempts to curtail smoking have been met so far with minimal success, but Granger says he’s willing to be patient. The passionate letters he says he receives from both smokers and non-smokers alike are symptoms of trying to reconcile a divided community.

Smokers have various reasons for smoking the Pool hall. Granger has received letters detailing the various reasons for their continued smoking. One frequent Pool-hall-smoker who preferred not to be named had this to say: “There’s no problem with people smoking in the Pool hall under the condition that they are aware that there may be others in the Pool hall that don’t want to.” He continued, “If everyone in the Pool hall consents to them smoking, I see no problem with them smoking.”

Community Safety hopes that the signs will promote a more open discussion and remind smokers that stepping outside the GCC to smoke is convenient when compared to stepping out of buildings such as the Library.
