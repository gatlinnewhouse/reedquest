The first women’s basketball game in recent memory was held last Friday, Nov. 2, in the gym. As the game against Pacific University was merely a scrimmage, official score could not be kept. However, Reed scored 4 points to Pacific’s 49 in the first half, and 9 to Pacific’s 51 in the second half. According to Reed point guard Maggie Black, the team “majorly improved” as the game went on, and the team was very pleased with their overall performance. The players cite the student and fan turnout as one of the higher points of the night, with one member stating that the cheers and support had a significant impact on them.

The creation of the women’s team emerged as a result of the planning and organization of the members of this year’s team. Meg Ryan ’13 was among those who proposed the assembly of a women’s-only team to Athletic Director Michael Lombardo last year. Last year’s players did not receive credit for their weekly practices—the administration informed them that they had to “earn it”, according to Shelby Wauson, who plays post. Both Ryan and teammate Brittany Wideman were responsible for hiring Bernadette Diepenbrock, the current coach.

The team’s seniors describe playing on Reed’s co-ed team in the past, stating that they were often forced to play positions other than those they were trained for due to physical differences between the female and male players. The players also report that male opponents were often hesitant to make contact with them in the same manner as their male teammates, which made participating in the co-ed team difficult. “We worked really hard to get this, and we’re proud,” Ryan says.

Going into last Friday’s game, the women’s team had humble expectations. Pacific University’s varsity team had a considerable height advantage in addition to a well-established women’s basketball program. Diepenbrock stresses that the Reed’s program is still very much in the process of being established. The team’s overall sentiment is that of a desire to progress. “I have really high hopes for our improvement”, says Black.

The women’s basketball team has 7 more games this semester, and the season continues into March.
