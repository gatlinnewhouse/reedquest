Prepare yourself: Proposed changes to the Community Constitution would modify the process by which changes can be made to the way Quest editors come by their jobs.

Breathe. The changes. Will modify a process. The process regulates another process. That process is the one in which a darling little _Quest_ writer kicks off the training wheels, makes Daddy proud, and becomes a _Quest_ editor. But the appointments process is contentious.

Did you make it? Currently, any change to the appointments process must be made in the Community Constitution. To modify the Constitution would require a referendum vote by the Student Body. Instead, according to the Constitutional changes now before the Student Body, any change to the appointments process will only require the approval of Senate.

_The Quest_&#8216;s appointments process came under scrutiny last year from the paper&#8217;s editorial board (now in its third iteration). They proposed that, instead of being elected en masse by the Student Body each semester, _Quest_ boards be composed of editors selected individually by the serving _Quest_ board. That board, and the following one that served last semester, said internal appointments were a more rational and technocratic way to pick out the best editors. But opponents in Senate and on campus worried it would promote a nepotistic system that violated Reed&#8217;s traditions.

Aside from Harvard University&#8217;s Harvard Crimson, which is considered unique because editors are elected by the paper&#8217;s staff, Reed&#8217;s system is the only one _The_ _Quest_ knows of where a newspaper&#8217;s staff is chosen by election. An effort to commence the Constitutional changes necessary to modify this system last semester was dropped after it failed to gain support in Senate. This semester&#8217;s board has not made an endorsement of either method.

Outgoing President Brian Moore &#8217;13, who was said by Senators to be the force behind the proposed _Quest_ changes, could not be reached by press time to requests for comments. Other minor Constitutional changes will be voted on along with this one. Along with technical clarifications, other proposed Constitutional changes include:

  * For purposes of reaching quorum – the minimum number of members present required for a vote to be valid – the President will count as a voting member.
  * Editors of _The Quest_ and the chair of Judicial Board will no longer be “ex-officio non-voting member(s) of the Senate,” eliminating a position that no one can characterize but all agree never had a functional purpose.
  * Former Student Body Presidents will have “ex-oficio” added to their “non-voting members” titles.
