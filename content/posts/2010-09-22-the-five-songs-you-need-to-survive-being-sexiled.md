At some point in your college career, you’re sure to get sexiled. Instead of taking it lying down (I’m sure there’s a lame pun in there somewhere, forgive me for not taking the time to find it), you should definitely use this playlist to turn what could be a miserable experience into a wonderful opportunity to make your roommate and whomever they happen to be bangin’ feel just as awkward as you do. Some of these songs will make them realize the pain you’re feeling as a result of their selfish, selfish behavior. Others will just make them feel icky.

The bottom line is this: if the walls are thin enough for you to hear them opening their third condom wrapper, they’re definitely thin enough for them to hear you blasting these songs.
  
**
  
“Dancing With Myself” – Billy Idol**
  
While your roommate and his/her boyfriend/girlfriend/drunken one-night stand are gettin’ it on and interrupting your study time/nap/Grey’s Anatomy marathon with their moans of ecstasy/turn-by-turn directions to their g-spots/pelvis-on-pelvis slapping noises, let Billy Idol remind them that you are trapped in your room, dancing all by your lonesome.

**“Pregnant” – R. Kelly**
  
I’m going to let the lyrics speak for themselves on this one: “Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant/Lay your body down and get you pregnant/ Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up.” Or this gem, “Never felt nothing like this/She’s more than a mistress, enough to handle my business/Gonna put that girl in my kitchen.” And of course: “I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty/Sweetest girl in the world. I mean it. And on top of that, shes a cutie/I ain’t seen nothing like her around here in a while/And if I had a girl she’d be the one to bear my child.”

While these arguably well-intentioned but ultimately kinda misogynistic lyrics may be just the thing to get people in a baby-makin’ kind of mood, I doubt many college students are really looking to be in a baby-makin’ mood while they’re having sex. If your roommate’s particularly annoying sex happens to be gay sex, the effectiveness of this song as a mood-killer skyrockets.

**“Angel” – Sarah McLachlan**
  
If, at some point during your roommate’s tryst, the dulcet tones of Trey Songz, Enrique Iglesias, or Jeremih wafting through the walls get to be annoying, you should battle back with this classic song from the patron saint of the ASPCA, Sara McLachlan. The soaring vocals conjur images of dead animals encased “in the arms of an angel.” Sexy. If you can find a way to project that heartbreaking commercial – the one with the battered animals and Miss McLachlan begging you to donate money – into your roommate’s boudoir, even better.

**“Piss on You” – Dave Chappelle**
  
What could possibly be better than R. Kelly singing about knocking gurlz up to kill the mood? Dave Chappelle making fun of R. Kelly by singing about peeing on gurlz. As if the proclaimation “I wanna piss on you” isn’t enough to make the typical couple cringe mid-thrust, Chappelle is kind enough to include the lyric “Drip, drip, drip.” You definitely want to make sure your roommate isn’t into water sports before relying too heavily on this song, though. Otherwise, you might just end up sexiled and smelling urine.

**“I Touch Myself” – The Divinyls**
  
A gentle reminder from Billy Idol that you’re in your room alone, a sexy reminder from R. Kelly that they’re potential makin’ more than just love, a depressing reminder from Sara McLachlan that MILLIONS OF ANIMALS DIE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEY’RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO STOP IT, and a funny if somewhat disgusting reminder from Dave Chappelle that he’s really wants to piss on them should be adequate to  get your roommate and their squeeze to stop their vociferous copulation.

If, nowever, they continue headstrong to sexytown, telling you and the Honor Principle to take a hike, do what Samantha Jones did in that one episode of Sex and the City. In the immortal words of a Carrie Bradshaw voiceover: “If you can’t join ‘em, beat it.” And be sure to play this song loudly enough to let your roommate know exactly what you’re doing.

**Bonus Traxxx: “Like a Virgin” – Madonna**
  
Another tempting option might be to simply start insulting your roomie’s skills as a lover. Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” is the perfect song with which to do this for two reasons.

First of all, Madonna’s voice in this song can only be banshee-esque. She’s a fabulous banshee but banshee music isn’t the most conducive to the ol’ in-and-out.

Then, on top of that, the lyrics themselves provide some great fodder for insinuating your roommate has as much experience as a twelve year-old. Be sure your roommate doesn’t think you’re employing the Reservoir Dogs analysis of the song, though.
