_We live in an age where our postmodern sensibilities have translated into flourishing musical creativity. This, paired with the death of radio, has led to the creation of nearly every subgenre imaginable. But how do you keep track of them all? Each week, we here at the Quest do our best to help you make sense of all this alternativeness._

I am going to straight up admit that I hate dubstep. Breakbeats aren’t really my thing, and I find the gratuitous use of wobble unnecessary (if not downright goofy). Knowing this, a good friend of mine—one whose taste in music I appreciate and respect a great deal—tried to reintroduce me to dubstep. Despite my resistance, he insisted that I had only been exposed to a mainstream-friendly rendition of dubstep (which he called “brostep”). In the end, I refused, and my friend could draw no other conclusion except that I was being a snob and not giving dubstep the fair shake it deserves. 

And while I am, indeed, a huge music snob, my friend misses the point. It is not that I hate dubstep because it is dubstep; it just does not have what I’m looking for in electronic music. Suffice to say, my distaste for dubstep comes from me being something of an electro-pansy. I can say, with some degree of certainty, that my musical inheritance is firmly rooted in the sounds of summer—Donna Summer, that is. 

I grew up listening to disco, and as a result I like my electro to have catchy vocal hooks, a strong sense of rhythm, and a standard four-to-the-floor drum beat. Much to my luck, I’m not alone in this sentiment. Many electronic musicians (particularly house producers) have also staked claims to this inheritance; Justice called their 2007 masterpiece † a “disco-opera,” and artists like Calvin Harris and LCD Soundsystem constantly invoke the ethos of disco in their work. As a result, much of today’s electro (despite its distortion, compression, and modulation) models itself after disco on a rhythmic level. 

Some, however, choose to take this inheritance a step further, and in doing so, virtually revive their musical ancestry. This brings us to this week’s featured subgenre: Nu-disco. 

Nu-disco (also called “disco house”), in some sense, works opposite of disco-influenced electro in that it seeks to create disco that is subsequently influenced by electro. A bit of music history is required here. In the early ‘80s, after disco was officially deemed uncool by the Disco Demolition Night of ‘79, house music rose from its ashes, using synths and drum machines to reinvent the standards of dance music. Originally heavily influenced by disco, house came into its own during the late ‘80s and ‘90s, developing its own distinctive qualities and an aesthetic that was influenced more europop than the funk and soul of yesteryear’s disco. Since then, house has diversified significantly, leading to every subgenre imaginable.
  
Nu-disco, however, is special because it brings things full circle; it reunites house with its long-deceased musical parent. As a result, it is oftentimes difficult to discern what is “house” and what is “disco.” While not traditionally “instrumental” by any means, nu-disco often uses live instrumentation instead of synthesizers to create a sound that is distinctly disco (see “Any Which Way”). In this sense, a lot of nu-disco can sound like classic disco, making the two practically indistinguishable. However, unlike contemporary house, nu-disco puts a premium on the interplay between vocals and bass (evidenced by the questions asked by Classixx in “I’ll Get You”), leading to vocally-driven &#8211; instead of instrumentally-driven &#8211; hooks. ‘70s soul joints are frequently sampled (see “aNYway” and “Y.S.L.M.”), making nu-disco characteristically more melodic than house. And more often than not, the bass itself is hella funky (see “Baby I’m Yours”). 

What does this amount to? A salacious revival of disco that rejects the old adage “out with the old, in with the new” and is nothing short of danceable. Check out some of our picks below.
