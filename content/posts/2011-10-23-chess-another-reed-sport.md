On Friday, October 7<sup>th</sup>, at 4:30 pm in the Student Union, Reed hosted Charles Schulien, a professional chess player who introduced himself as a “master, a term that generally denotes a certain amount of skill.” After he explained some basics of strategy, he demonstrated a few of them in some quick games. Then he gave a public lesson wherein he played eight games at once and beat everyone who showed up to the exhibition except for Robinson, with whom he tied.

Last year, Reed’s chess team won the Class 5 Championship over other American and Canadian colleges. Marcus Robinson ‘13 explains how physically taxing that victory was: they were in Wisconsin in December, playing six hour games, and the only nearby food was Subway, which they ate for six meals a day. Robinson comments: “chess is exhausting; we had to keep refueled.”

For those interested in this sport, now is the time to try it out. Some of the chess team is experienced enough to provide coaching, so no one will be terrible for long. Though the chess team hasn’t had much publicity in years past, they are beginning to reach out to the Reed community. For those who can’t play chess, Robinson says that they would certainly appreciate volunteer cheerleaders (there wasn’t room for them in the budget).
