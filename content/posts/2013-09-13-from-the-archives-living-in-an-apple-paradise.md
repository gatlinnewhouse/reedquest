In 1988, computers were still a new and frightening invention, and an article in that year’s student handbook reflected the social castigation that computer users might have faced in that dark, dark era of Reaganomics. It’s almost as if 2001: A Space Odyssey actually took place, and “Apple Macintosh” is the black monolith that appeared in the heart of Reed campus, leaving the student body to fret about like the scared apes they were. Feast your eyes:

“It is four o&#8217;clock in the morning. You have a Humanities paper due at ten and you just had a brainstorm which contradicts the last three pages that you typed on that trusty old Smith Corona. To quote Dirty Harry, “you’re shit out of luck.” This scenario is quite common during the first couple weeks at Reed. Don’t get screwed over, let computers help you. Change your mind? No biggee- just hit the delete button. It saves a lot of time, frustration, and whiteout. Computers were created to be labor-saving devices.

‘If I am seen using a geek-boc I will instantly be identified with a bunch of ‘science types’ with pocket protectors.’ No way. At Reed _almost_ everybody, even the most confirmed simple-existence granolas, use computers. With the total time saved on one year’s worth of Hum papers composed and edited on a computer instead of written and typed you could probably spend a weekend at the ski cabin. You owe it to yourself to do it the easy way.

It must be made clear that ‘computer’ doesn’t mean any computer here, we’re talking about Apple Macintoshes, the official Reed College talisman. You cannot enter any building on campus without finding Macs; they’re used in almost all the business and administration offices, even the Physical Plant. Macintoshes are known for being highly ‘user-friendly’ and versatile, and well, we’ve got so damn many of them that if IBM came out with a better one we’d just grin and upgrade; probably nothing could drag us from the Apple altar. Seriously, Reed is wall-to-wall Macs, which is a good reason to learn to use them ASAP.
