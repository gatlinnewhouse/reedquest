Dear Reed Community,

Above all else, we all chose to come here for at least one reason, and that is to learn. In this respect, it’s safe to say that I got a lot more than I bargained for on Monday night. Indeed, I learned a lesson in humility I will never forget. I feel I must apologize for the way I acted that night. It was rash, heated, and unprovoked aggression in an environment that was supposed to be anything but. Although I had intended for my comments to spark a heated debate, I now realize that the manner in which I presented my points prohibited this from happening. For that, I apologize sincerely.

With that said, I am not writing this letter merely to apologize. I still believe that much of what I said was, and still is, indicative of persistent problems in our community, and that it would be in our interest to discuss them. Firstly—and this was the question I had tried to build up to in my diatribe—honor is built on trust between parties and individuals. It can only exist insofar as there is trust between everyone involved. It is my concern that trust within our community is on the decline and if we do nothing to reconcile this, this trend will continue. My evidence for this is most visibly indicated by the increasing student hostility towards Gary Granger and the CSOs over implementation of the AOD policy. Indeed, there are other issues that also seek our immediate attention, as well as the outburst of anger towards the end of the Union about our failure to address the issue of sexual assault. Both were keynote issues brought up in the email about the event that we ultimately failed to address: issues which need to be dealt with sooner rather than later.

Secondly, there needs to be a discussion about our reputation and where it is headed. While the Honor Principle is a huge part of what defines us, it is far from the only factor. As previously mentioned, the value Reed places on learning is for many of us, the main reason we are here. The Humanities 110 curriculum provides the backbone of the Reed education for a reason. It represents the idea that the more we study and the more we learn, the more we discover that everything is connected and that nothing in the known universe exists completely detached from all else. This happens in any field of study, both intellectual and spiritual. Indeed, I came into Reed believing that it was a safe environment conducive to exploration of both the wonders of academia and the spiritual unconscious of the mind, but it seems that we are increasingly drifting away from the latter under the pretense of bolstering the former. I for one do not believe this to be a trade off that an institution of our caliber can, in good conscience, make. If we truly value our reputation as a place where learning of all types is cherished, then we must either accept it in all its forms or risk losing that reputation, for better or worse. Indeed, it was this unique combination of both that drew some of the greatest thinkers of our parents’ generation to Reed, and I truly believe that it will continue to do so in the future if we can only continue to support it now in our current time of darkness. After all, if Reed is no longer the place where this kind of education can happen, where else is left?

These, my fellow Reedies, are the issues I meant to bring before you that Monday night. And here I present them to you in humility, free of anger and aggression in the hopes that you will feel inclined to have a serious discussion about them; if not with me, then with somebody else in the Reed community.

I close by reminding you of our ultimate goal in attending Reed, and that is to learn. So please, continue to discuss, learn, and experiment safely so we may grow together as a community. I thank you for the time it took to read this letter and any time you spend discussing the issues I have laid forth. On that same token, I hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me for wasting your time at the Union.

Humbly yours,
  
Michael Zhao
