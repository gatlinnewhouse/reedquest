Students camped out in Vollum Lounge on Tuesday night to watch the election unfold. It did not take long, however, for the outcome of the presidential election to be decided. At approximately 8:15 p.m. PST, the room erupted into applause. After winning Ohio, President Barack Obama won the presidency with 274 electoral votes; Romney had 204. The final count was 303-206 for Obama.

Out of the chaos of the newly excited room, _The New York Times&#8217;_ announcement of Obama’s victory was projected on the screen, and Vollum Lounge erupted into a chat of, “Four more years! Four more years!” There had been an earlier round of celebration after NBC called the election for Obama, but students quickly became nervous again once they realized no other news organization had called the election. The _Times_ announcement was seen as a final confirmation. The projection&#8217;s next image was “afterparty in the SU!!!!!!!!!!!!” typed in the Google search bar.

Students also celebrated announcements of Democratic wins in contested Senate races, and ballot measures, like Colorado&#8217;s legalization of marijuana and especially Maine, Maryland, and Washington&#8217;s legalization of same-sex marriage, the first time popular referendums have approved the issue.

But just before the excitement, the election appeared to be tightly contested.

“I’m feeling two things. The first is immensely nervous,” John Iselin says, who put on the debate viewings this year. “It hit me three hours ago that there are risks. Obama may lose.”

The uncertainty of this presidential race also made for an adrenaline rush.

“There’s a level of energy and it’s attractive,” Iselin says. “I love being with energetic Reedies.”

Iselin was the mind behind providing Reedies with a place to view the presidential debates as well as the election results this year. The Political Science department and Student Body funds funded the viewing events.

“Over the summer I was talking to (political science professor) Chris Koski and we thought it would be great to show the debates,” Iselin says. “Reed is a great little community, but it’s important to make Reedies informed and bring politically active Reedies together.”

Assistant Dean of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Jyl Shaffer poked fun at Iselin by characterizing him as “the hanging chad of the 2012 election coverage” because his live streaming of the debates would sometimes freeze up.

Shaffer and Ariel Dooner also joked that they should have made shirts for the election season that said, “Saving myself for Romney.”

Sophomore Gabriella Chronis, an Ohio voter, says she felt especially important. She waited to send in her absentee ballot after hearing about the decisive effect late ballots can have in situations such as a recount.

“It’s the only time I feel powerful,” Chronis says.

After the results were announced, students celebrated in Vollum Lounge to “Party in the USA” by Miley Cyrus and “Three Little Birds” by Bob Marley, followed by Obama&#8217;s campaign song, “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I&#8217;m Yours,” by Stevie Wonder.

“I felt like I was a juggalo who had won a year’s worth of Faygo,” freshman Jesse Wedewer says of his reaction after Obama won. “I did a bunch of tennis fist pumps and blasted Jay-Z as two years&#8217; worth of anxiety left my system.”

Freshman Marina Moro also felt a rush of excitement at seeing the results of the election.

“I was in the library and I looked it up. When I found out, I was super stoked but I didn’t want to scream. So I just raised my hands and said, ‘Yeah!’ in a whisper. It was sort of a grunt,” she says.

Moro added, “One thing is that Obama doesn’t have to worry about the re-election, so hopefully things will be good. I’m hopeful that this term will be better than the last.”
