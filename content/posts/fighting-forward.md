**\*CW: Sexual Violence, PTSD, etc.** 

To simply classify 2017 as a year of heartbreak would be to understate the severity of a globally bruised heart. To acknowledge the reality that the American people inaugurated an embodiment of rape culture on January 20, 2017 is a tragedy hard to digest for those who grieve the loss of decency and the potential loss of democracy. Trump’s predatory misogyny and his capacity to harm and oppress marginalized communities, including people who identify as female, remains unbearable. Fueled by the need to address this human rights calamity, we, as women, took to the streets. The world did not hold its collective breath — it howled, shouted, chanted, screamed and stomped in protest. We clutched each other’s hands and smudged fingers with Sharpie ink and crushed fistfuls of clementines. Remarkably, worldwide participation of female-identified and allied participants was estimated at almost five million people on January 21, 2017, in Women’s Marches spanning the globe.

From a pillow nest in my dorm in Southern Wales, my thumb numbly scrolled from article to article, website to website, image to image, hands shaking as I learned of the overwhelming surge of resilience and resistance. I did not march that day, exhausted by the constant Welsh rain, a lack of sunshine, and the nagging PTSD that often comes with being a survivor. I did dance barefoot in our tiny kitchen, however, and mixed salt with wool as the radiant women I housed with curved their arms around my spine and recounted tales of glitter and sweat collected in the rainy concrete crevices of Downing Street only hours earlier.

Later that evening, as the temperature steadily dropped and our seaside enclosure churned, I vowed to march alongside another cosmic display of bravery should the situation continue. Now looking back, I can gently reassure the fractured but eager version of myself I projected — fixed to crumpled duvet and amber stovetop amidst chaos — that I did.

Portland’s 2018 Women’s March manifested differently than the volatility emerging from 2017’s march. Unofficially split into four events staggered throughout the day and all around Portland, it included the Indigenous Womxn’s March, the NXT LVL X She Shreds J20 RALLY + PARTY, the National March for Impeachment, the MeToo March, and SpeakOUT. I attended the SpeakOUT event in Pioneer Courthouse Square and the MeToo March, a subset of the larger-scale National Women’s Marches that happened simultaneously throughout the United States.

I did not attend alone, flanked by cherished friends and hundreds of other fiercely anticipatory bodies as we flocked to the rainy square. Our sightline, elevated by our position perched on a brick ledge, was decorated by slogan-clad signs and pink knitwear. We listened to survivors of sexual violence share intimate and often empowering narratives and empathized, collectively. An atmosphere of support and ferocity was palpable, and despite several attempts by hecklers, the gathering remained unified. Some statements — as is usually the case with open microphone scenarios — were problematic in their binary interpretation of gender and even political discourse, but flocked by positive influences and positivity, we set off for the march on a determined note. Winding on a perhaps preordained path, the streets echoed with chants and muddy footprints. A few crowd favorites included: “It’s time to impeach the predator in chief,” “Fuck Donald Trump!,” “Black rights are human rights! Immigrant rights are human rights! Refugee rights are human rights! Trans rights are human rights! Women’s rights are human rights!” People held their signs resolutely, thick paper meeting humid city air. We continued for almost an hour before ducking into a side street to re-gather thoughts and head back to Reed.

There is always room for diversification within movements such as the Women’s Marches that have taken and may continue to take place; I believe that these events need more intersectional solidarity and less focus on assigned gender. Regardless of these complexities, our car ride home was full of laughter laced with proud exhaustion, and I couldn’t have been happier basking in the support and solidarity that I felt. There is an innate strength to be found in unity, and we must continue to fight for and lift each other up in times that threaten.

This should be taken with a grain of salt, though. In a conversation with one of the other Reedies who was in attendance at the march, we found ourselves in emphatic agreement. Although protest can be an extremely powerful tool, we need to be more than catchy slogans and isolated displays of activism for a movement to be substantial and sustained in the name of exacting genuine change.
