The plans to rebuild the Greywood building have been put on hold. The Board of Trustees, who met this weekend, decided that a new Performing Arts building remains a greater priority than the reconstruction of Greywood.

President Diver sent out an email to the Student Body on Monday informing the community that the building of a new Greywood building would be deferred. In a separate email, he explained, “About six years ago, the Faculty and Board of Trustees engaged in a strategic planning process to identify the college’s highest priorities to be included as funding goals in the (then) upcoming centennial fundraising campaign. That process identified a new Performing Arts building as the highest academic building priority.”

The plan for the new building, created by Opsis Architecture of Portland, was completed in 2009 but was put on hold as a result of a struggling economy and difficulties in fundraising.

Then, as part of the ten year Master Plan, says Diver, because of “the frustrations in trying to raise naming gifts for the Performing Arts Center, and the current advantages of low interest rates and relatively low construction costs, we went ahead with planning for a new academic/administrative building to meet some of those needs.” This was the Greywood plan, postponed by the trustees this past weekend.

According to Ed McFarlane, head of the Building Committee, $20 million must be raised in order to begin construction of the Performing Arts building and, if fundraising proves successful, another $20 million are to be borrowed to complete the project.

The Greywood building was estimated to cost the College $13 million.

Kathleen Worley, professor of Acting and Directing at Reed, wrote in a recent statement that she, along with other faculty from various departments “sent a letter to the president and dean of the faculty requesting a thoughtful reconsideration of priorities and an investigation of how moving ahead with construction on the Greywood site might affect progress on the Performing Arts building.”

The new building will offer various resources for students of the Performing Arts.

“One reason the Performing Arts facility was identified as a priority,” Worley continues, “is that our facilities compare very poorly to those of our ‘sister schools.’ Currently, dance has no home of its own, music has no soundproof practice rooms, and theatre constructs its sets in a building located across from 28 West.”

The Admissions Office and Career Services, who were to be the largest group of tenants of the new Greywood building, will remain in their current locations for an undefined period of time. Both show little objection to the changes.

When asked how the changes affect the future of the Admissions Office, Keith Todd, Dean of Admissions, said, “this does not change any of our plans at this point. We will be doing the same kinds of work in either our current location or a new one. Since the projected move was over a year away, we had made no changes to our current activities and practices”

Similarly, Ron Albertson, Director of Career Services, maintained that Career Services “still has a home here in Greywood, and we’re busy as can be.”

According to Ed McFarlane, it is anticipated that when the money is raised, the Performing Arts building will be completed within eighteen months of the start of construction.  Thus, the faculty offices, student classrooms, and administrative offices that would have been offered with the construction of Greywood remain on hold.

The Performing Arts building, when completed, will come at least eight years after discussions were began about its construction. Hopefully, Greywood will not have a similar, lengthy wait.
