Dear Reader,

Welcome back! Winter break comes and goes, but the _Quest_ is always here, albeit with a new editorial staff. Our new board is a combination of both new and returning _Quest_ editors and we’re excited to embark on yet another editorial adventure this semester! 

During the Student Body elections at the end of last semester, the _Quest_ Editorial Board came under criticism for issues of diversity and openness. We hear these concerns and are fully devoted to implementing specific policies and increasing accessibility to the _Quest_ and our processes through greater outreach and transparency. It is easy to fall into apathy, and in recognition of this, the new board is making a commitment to continue to listen and respond to criticisms from the Reed community as well as to maintain journalistic integrity to the best of our ability. To further these goals, our new board will be hosting a public forum on Thursday, February 8 from 6–8 p.m. in the SU. We invite you all to come share your opinions with us that we can make the _Quest_ the best it can be.

We also invite you to come write for the _Quest_! The best means to increase the diversity of the opinions, articles, and writers represented in the paper is your voice. This does not mean that we do not take responsibility for our role in addressing these concerns, but we hope this can be a cooperative effort. Writers’ meetings take place on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. in the Student Publications Office (GCC–47). Our work is only possible because of the great writers and other community members who contribute. We want your stories, your reviews, your comics, and your news. Above all, we want your voices. We hope to see you there!

Sincerely,

The _Quest_ Editorial Board
