I don’t know why we have sent seven students to the hospital in ambulances so far this year, when by this point last year we had sent only one—but we have.  When I recently shared this information with students during meetings (seven in all) in the residence halls last week, there was no consensus opinion about why so many Reedies had become intoxicated to the point of a medical emergency.  There was, however, a unanimous feeling when I described how, over one weekend, three first-year students ended up alone and unconscious: a sense of surprise, dismay, and concern.  When I described how one of these students had been found along a Canyon path, unconscious and alone at 3 am, surprise was replaced by shock, dismay by alarm, and concern by fear.

I, too, am afraid.  I am afraid of the obvious: that the call to CSOs will come too late.  In addition, I am afraid because of something less obvious: what I may be required to do in order to try to prevent this trend from continuing.

When students become so intoxicated that they are at risk in the ways we have already seen this year, there is a gap that must be filled.  The gap is the void between what must be done to prevent this level of intoxication and isolation, and what is actually being done by Reedies to care for one another.  Where there is a gap that creates danger for our community, I am expected to step in.  I am afraid of using the options open to me to fill this gap because, even at my best, I am a blunt (no pun here) instrument when I am required to intercede in students’ lives.  The options open to me are many, and almost uniformly ugly: do nothing (clearly a rhetorical option) and hope for the best; card everyone seen with alcohol; drop by all on-campus gatherings and check to see what is being served; confiscate any alcohol at a gathering with underage students; and just generally be a pain in Reedies’ collectives posteriors.  This is what police and security departments at other colleges and universities do to “combat” alcohol use and abuse.  While it is “satisfying” in the sense that it is active and objective, we all know it doesn’t work.  So, if not nothing, and if not draconian measures, then what?  This is my answer: I make this appeal to students to take better care of one another—to do the most honorable thing.

I hope that the increase in calls by students reporting students in trouble is because of the medical amnesty policy and because we have removed a perceived barrier to asking for help.  However, even if that is true, we should not allow the people we care about to drink or “experiment” themselves into an ambulance.  Rather than talking about whether or not watching someone drink as much as s/he wants without trying to intercede is “dishonorable,” I am asking everyone in the community to use the Honor Principle as an exhortation to excellence.

It is easy to allow someone to just keep drinking because we believe people have the right to make their own choices, or because people have to figure stuff out on their own, or . . . (fill in the blank with your own justification).  It is hard to step forward, out of the crowd of bystanders, and to take a stand.  I did not come here for “easy,” and I’ve not been disappointed.  I do not believe that the majority of Reedies came here for “easy” either.
