Commons is a utopia of foods, fragrance, and flavor. Strolling past the decked counters of Commons, it can be easy to fall for the illusion of universal abundance at Reed. But this abundance comes at a cost and—though rarely a topic of conversation—not all Reed students, faculty, or staff, have consistent access to an abundance of food. After investigating this issue last fall, a team of concerned community members formed the Food Security Initiative (FSI). Stemming from that initiative, Reed College finally joined the growing number of universities with a food pantry on campus that opened this summer.

According to the Students for Education, Empowerment, and Direct Service (SEEDS) website, “FSI promotes food justice, food security, sustainability, community, and honor by providing free food, basic supplies, and resource information to current students, staff, and faculty.” The Food Security Initiative was started in 2016 by a team of students, faculty and staff from all sects of the community. “The initial group met with the idea of not necessarily starting the food pantry, but to investigate the problem of food insecurity at Reed,” said SEEDS Coordinator Tara Miller. The idea for the Reed Community Pantry came out of that working group.

Now, a year later, the Community Pantry is already in full swing. FSI Coordinator Roselyn Tovar and others helped set up the pantry last summer. After a successful trial run, the pantry will now be open year-round on Sundays from 1:30–5:00 p.m. and Wednesdays from 3:00pm–7:00 p.m. It is found on the ground floor of Gray Campus Center in GCC 042 and provides free food as well as other supplies like toiletries and stationery to all Reed students and staff. 

But what is food insecurity and why would it be a problem at Reed?

“One thing that’s important to know about food insecurity,” said Miller, “is that it’s something a lot of different people experience and not just people from low-SES backgrounds. There are many factors that affect a student’s economic status.” 

Food insecurity is defined as not having consistent access to sufficient and nutritious food. Nationwide, 14 percent of households experience some form of food insecurity each year. On college campuses this number is significantly higher. Even private and well-known institutions like Reed are not exempt. During the spring of 2017, the FSI working group conducted surveys of Reed students, staff, and faculty, and gathered data on the portion of the Reed community experiencing, or that have recently experienced, food insecurity. They also looked into Reed students’ access to support from Portland community pantries and other resources.

Circumstances that contribute to food insecurity, regardless of a student’s economic background and financial aid situation, include: regularly sending money back home, complicated family dynamics, and unexpected medical costs. Faculty and staff may experience similar extenuating circumstances. 

The pantry itself is organized much like the setup of a small-town general store. The shelves are lined with everything from baking flour and Cheerios, to chocolate bars and chemistry textbooks. Visitors are free to browse and take what they need. Upon entry, visitors must show a Reed ID and sign a waiver. Individuals are also prompted with the opportunity to complete an optional demographic survey, but the resource is available to absolutely everyone on campus. “We want to create a safe space,” said Tovar, “it’s entirely based on the honor code.” Pantry organizers want to create a comfortable and stigma-free zone where community members can get the help they need without being submitted to ‘eligibility’ questions.

Funding for the Community Pantry comes from the Student Body Senate, as well as board points that are donated at the end of last semester. The pantry is entirely staffed by volunteers who repackage food, welcome visitors during opening hours, and jam to their playlists during slow hours. 

“I want to underscore how many people have contributed to making this happen,” said Miller. Indeed, the FSI has come a long way since it’s beginning only a year ago. The pantry is only one facet of a larger initiative. They are also working on other programs, such as a board points sharing system, and are looking to become involved in the greater Portland community. Additionally, Tovar stressed her hope for increased dialogue and collaboration between related campus organizations. 

“In the future, I really want this to be a sustainable program, and for there to be other ways for the school to address food insecurity, like through the financial aid process,” said Tovar. The Community Pantry is off to a great start, but—for continued success—it will need consistent support. The shelves are still only half full, so there is plenty of room for more contributions. Also, with even more volunteer support the Community Pantry could extend its hours, making it even more accessible. Above all, we as a community need to work on making the issues of food insecurity more transparent, and do our best to combat the stigma associated with it.
