HOLD UP!

Bitch, don’t you dare fart while I’m brushing my teeth. Actually, the thing that bothers me most are the people who try to cough me out of the bathroom. Just because you have a shy asshole does not mean I have to leave. Bitch, you better train that shit, ‘cause I do.

I know people love me, but please don’t talk to me while you’re on the toilet. The last thing I want to hear is you pause mid-sentence due to a hard bowel movement. I do not have to hear about your day that badly. Another thing that makes my stilettos break are when people talk to each other while they’re in two different stalls. Please don’t have a full-blown heart to heart about your significant other. If I’m not sleeping with your boyfriend, I do not want to hear about it. And put the cell phone away while you’re at it. Do not talk to your mother while you’re peeing! Hearing the toilet flush on the other side is just weird.

And an important note: FLUSH. All things, every time, and make sure it goes down.

I’m tired, so here’s a suggestion. For a truly awkward bathroom moment, try this one out: Walking into the men’s restroom in full drag, complete with the five-inch heels and a boa, and then hiking up your miniskirt to use the urinal next to the guy holding a beer bottle in one hand. I am not responsible for any injuries that occur if attempted outside of Reed College. Also, avoid gas stations bathrooms, dive bars, truck stops, the entire state of Texas and any other place that might get you shot at.

Don’t make me fabreze your ass.
