Seeing as it is nearly time for our first event of the year, (Oktoberfest is coming up on this Friday, the 29th), it seems like a good time to introduce ourselves to all the new blood at Reed and to remind everyone of what exactly we do.

Beer Nation is a student organization that is dedicated to bringing delicious, quality beer to campus for the student body to consume.  We have a couple of beer gardens each year at which those who are of age are able to enjoy the many, many fine beers we have selected with friends and classmates. We work to give you guys one of the best deals for beer in Portland: ten bucks for a ton of high-quality microbrewstuffs; less than you’ll spend on your average decent night out. We also work with the French house and German house to bring you two other events, free of charge.

But in order to keep being able to do this, we need you guys to help us out. We run our gardens on volunteer help. When we host a beer garden, we need people to sign up and help with pouring, security and pass sales. You need to be 21 and over in order to work security and pouring, but anyone can work pass sales. Without your help, we won’t be able to keep making these beer gardens happen.

We also need you guys to follow the rules that we have set down. Just remember that we’re students, just like you; everything bad that happens to us will ultimately reflect on the college and student body. We’re in full compliance with the OLCC, which means you MUST be 21 or older to get in. We understand that it sucks to have your older friends go into the garden, leaving you outside to fend for yourself (believe us, we know what it’s like), but it’s only one night out of many. You’ll be 21 soon enough, and you’ll be able to enjoy the gardens then. Everyone has to wait at some point in time.

Don’t try to get in with a fake; it won’t work, we’ll definitely know, and you’ll be fake-less by the end of the night.

For those who are old enough to get in and do, it’s pretty simple: Follow the golden rule and everyone is happy. Also, no beer outside of the garden.

So that is basically it. We love putting on great events for everyone to enjoy, and we hope that you’ll help us out and let us continue to do so.
