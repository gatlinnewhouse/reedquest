“How big is that pig in your head?”

Such is the question that prompted freshman Alan Cline to dramatically reconsider his relationship with his dorm. Cline recalls an acid trip last semester, during which he was compelled to believe that Chittick had momentarily transformed into a giant pig: “On this pig there was [one of Chittick’s balconies], and we were all sitting on the balcony while the pig would walk around campus and go places. Sometimes, it would just go and roll around in the canyon.”

The pig, named Pigsteed, is now painted onto the window and tarp that occupy the very same cross canyon balcony. Standing watch over its denizens, Pigsteed serves as a symbol of the strong community Chittick has built in the past year. But Alec Condon, a sophomore who frequents the balcony, cautions against calling the pig a ‘mascot.’ Condon believes the more appropriate term to be ‘deity’: a reference to the swine’s centrality in what is now the creation myth behind Reed’s newest theme dorm.

Cline and Condon are the co-creators of People Ingesting Gourmet, or “P.I.G.” dorm. The stated mission of the dorm, according to Condon and Cline, is to create enthusiasm about food: be it through cooking, events, or other means.

“We wanted to make a theme dorm about food because we cook together a fair amount,” Condon explained. “We just ended up asking ourselves, ‘why isn’t there a dorm about appreciating things that taste good?’”

“It’s safe to say that we cook food every day,” Cline added. “To be blunt, it is a habit for us.”

Cline’s zeal for edible treats is well documented. Last November, Cline wrote an op-ed piece entitled “Snacks You Should Eat, Even Though You’re Not Ten Years Old,” which spotlighted some of his childhood favorites. In addition, Cline was responsible for organizing “Pigsgiving,” a rendition of Thanksgiving whose meal consisted strictly of gummy worms, potato chips, and peach candy rings.

According to Condon, the iconization of Cline’s pig was the result of the compatibility of swine and appetency: two steadfast hallmarks of the Chittick community. “Once we had the idea for the food dorm, we naturally connected it to the idea of the pig,” Condon said. “After all, we’re pigs too and we like to eat.”

Both Condon and Cline insist that the focus of P.I.G. is “food appreciation,” as opposed to cooking an exclusively gourmet cuisine or creating fine dining experiences. Cline said that culinary sophistication, while welcome in P.I.G., is most certainly not required. “We’re not just about gourmet things that taste good, we’re about all things that taste good,” he noted, citing the simplicity of a family brownie recipe that has become a dorm specialty.

When asked about P.I.G.’s involvement with the wider Reed community, Condon expressed excitement at the prospect of collaborating with other food-related organization. “There are a lot of groups that we’d like to be a part of,” said Condon. He added that the dorm was considering pursuing “joint projects” with groups such as CAVE, Bagels and Schmear, and others capable of satisfying P.I.G.’s gastronomical needs.

Condon and Cline are unapologetic about the community’s attachment to the dorm, and are confident that P.I.G. would reside in Chittick next year. They cited Res Life’s desire to have a successful theme dorm in Chittick and noted how well the dorm was suited to the theme.

“Cooking is great in the cross canyon dorms because smells just waft down hallways,” quipped Condon.

Furthermore, Chittick’s excitement about food seems to have already given them a degree of notoriety.

“There is definitely one identifiable smell that people associate with Chittick,” Cline remarked. “And it’s a smell that makes you hungry.”

By this, it would seem obvious that Chittick has already succeeded in creating an identity for itself; an identity based on the idea of having a bottomless stomach. The only difference now, it seems, is that they have been able to turn Cline’s tripped-out idea into a reality.

Applications for P.I.G.are available at <http://iris.reed.edu/>, and are due March 4
