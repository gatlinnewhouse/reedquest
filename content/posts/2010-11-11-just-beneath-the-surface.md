_Students Balance Disabilities and Academic Pressure_

**Greta Moran**

Passive, tired faces look across the waiting room of the Health and Counseling Center, as one girl pushes sand around with a tiny rake. There’s no visible indication that anything is wrong, but mute anxiety suffuses the room. Disabilities underlie Reed in the same way, as imperceivable disruptions shape students’ lives in imperceivable ways.

During the 2009-2010 academic year, 124 students identified themselves as having disabilities. Only five were reported to have a visible physical disability.

“Because non-physical disabilities have no external markers like wheelchairs, they’re effectively invisible,” said Heather Stout, Director of Disability Support Services. “[If you have a disability], you could in fact be surrounded by people with the same disabilities. There’s no way of knowing.”

The Americans with Disabilities Act, which was passed in 1990 to prohibit discrimination based upon disability, defines a disability as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, according to Stout.

Students that wish to receive accommodations must self-identify as disabled by contacting Heather Stout. If they have not documented their disability already, Stout will refer them to a credentialed professional. Students then work with faculty to set up accommodations that could include extended exam times, private testing spaces, or note-taking services.

“I think a lot of students may wait to see what their needs are [before contacting me],” Stout said. Faculty members may contact Student Services and suggest that the student seek help. “Faculty are often the first point of contact for undiagnosed students.”

The most common disability at Reed is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 31 students, or 2 percent of the student body, have ADHD. This is slightly less than the national average of 3 to 7 percent.

“College is often where students are first diagnosed with ADHD, because academics become more demanding,” said Kris Anderson, professor of psychology.

“Although ADHD develops before the age of seven, many students are able to compensate until they arrive at college.”

Elizabeth Ogden ’11, known by most as Zuzu, has a type of ADHD characterized by a lack of attention to detail, an inability to follow instructions, difficulties with organization, and being easily distractible.

“[It’s like] the feeling of writing a paper and having the idea in your head, but not knowing the words,” Ogden said. “It’s like that, but in every element of your life.”

Ananya Kepper ’12, who has the same type of ADHD, said that she initially felt like there was a disparity between her intelligence and academic performance. She had a typical ADHD experience: failing all her classes because she did not hand in most of the assignments.

“A lot of people with ADHD are really good at doing two things at once. In class I knit—I make fingerless gloves,” Ogden said.

Neither she nor Kepper think of ADHD solely as an impairment. People with ADHD are often highly intuitive, Ogden said.

“I love who I am. My meds suck out my personality,” Kepper said. “A lot of what is charming, creative, and exciting about me [comes from my ADHD]. I’d rather be that person than a girl who can turn out work.

“People often believe that having ADHD is a conscious choice and ask questions like ‘Why don’t you just focus on focusing?’” Kepper said.

Kepper works actively to broaden people’s understanding of ADHD, particularly for those who have the disability. She is the SEEDS intern for Project Eye-to-Eye, a national mentoring program that unites college and grade school students with similar learning disabilities.

“[Reed students in the program are] young, goofy and relatable, but also represent success,” she said. “They are a symbol of hope to the students they work with at Grout Elementary School. The mentors encourage students to think about the way their brains work through art projects.”

19 students at Reed had learning disabilities that prevented learning in a typical manner last year, Stout said. Dyslexia, a disability characterized by having more difficulty reading in comparison to one’s skills in other academic areas, falls under this category.

“[Dyslexia is] something that’s not necessarily seen as legitimate, but as an excuse,” said one senior with a minor case of the disability. Despite the disability, she finds her experience similar to that of most Reed students.

“The expectation of the work load here is often unreasonable for anyone. It forces students to be selective,” she said.

While learning disabilities and ADHD exhibit themselves in fairly predictable ways, other mental disabilities, such as bipolar, occur in episodes that are harder to predict. Bipolar I is a mood disorder characterized by periods of mania and depression that involve shifts between inflated self-esteem, elevated mood and pressured speech to periods of fatigue, loss of energy, and a sense of worthlessness.

“[Bipolar is like having an] equilibrium that gets upset much more easily than most people,” said a male sophomore that has bipolar I. “Everyone has mood shifts. I am just affected a lot more.”

Services at the Health and Counseling Center may be useful preventative measures for disabilities triggered by environmental stress, said Kate Smith, director of Health and Counseling Services. This year, the Health and Counseling Center has added a naturopath, an acupuncturist, and a “mind spa” room with a massage chair.

Despite the accommodations that are available to students, Reed can still be a difficult place for those with disabilities, the sophomore said.

“Reed’s definitely a really difficult place to face the first episode of a mental illness. I’m still trying to find what accommodations I need, and it’s really hard.”
