Five weeks into the semester, Reed has received five takedown notices as a result of students using the school’s Internet network for illegal file sharing. From the ’07-’08 to the ’09-’10 school year, takedown notices increased fourfold.

Gary Schlickeiser, Computer User Services’ Director of Technology & Infrastructure Services and the person in charge of the Reed network, said these offenses are committed by Reedies in every class: “Takedown notices are across the board. Of the five notices so far this year only one has been a freshman. Often students living off-campus receive notices when they forget to turn off their [peer-to-peer] software when they come to campus.”

Whether intentional or not, using the Reed network for illegal file sharing carries consequences. Martin Ringle, Computing & Information Services’ Chief Technology Officer explained that the more notices the school receives, the more closely it will be monitored, resulting in more notices and an undesirable cycle destined to repeat itself.

Tony Palomino, Acting Director of Computer User Services, said CUS’ “main tool in the fight [against illegal use of copyrighted material] is education.”

Schlickeiser echoed this sentiment, saying, “From my point of view the most important part of the ‘punishment’ is educating the student about possible consequences of illegal file sharing and my hope is they will talk to other students about their experience. We are required to respond to takedown notices and cannot protect a student if we receive a subpoena. Copyright violations can lead to legal actions of up to $75,000 per infringement. It is bad enough when I have to contact a student about a takedown notice. It is much worse to tell a student they are about to be sued.”

At Tuesday’s Senate meeting, Palomino explained that CUS does no active monitoring of students’ Internet usage. If the school receives a takedown notice from a copyright holder, they then follow the steps prescribed by the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The school can receive a takedown notice for any use of copyrighted material without permission. Palomino explained that this includes online streaming as well as downloads.

According to CIS’ website “When Reed receives a copyright infringement claim involving music, video, software, or other digital materials […]: we check network usage logs and registration information to examine the system alleged to be involved in copyright infringement and we identify the person using it; we suspend the system’s Internet access; we notify the copyright holder (or agent) that we are handling the infringement claim under the guidelines of the DMCA.”

First time offenders can choose whether to acknowledge or deny using copyrighted material without permission. Those who choose to acknowledge it are required to reread the Computer User Agreement and information regarding copyright regulations and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, denied Internet access for five days, and required to sign a statement recognizing their copyright infringement, disregard for the Computer User Agreement, and promising to not repeat the behavior. In this scenario, the user’s identity remains undisclosed and the claimant is informed that the matter has been resolved under the DMCA.

If the user chooses to deny illegal use of copyrighted material, they are required to submit a statement to that effect and the claimant can choose to pursue a subpoena for the user’s identity so they can file a lawsuit against them.

Second time offenders are required to submit a statement recognizing their repeated violation of the CUA and that further violations will result in an Honor Case. Furthermore, the user is denied Internet access for up to the balance of the semester and the Dean of Students is informed of the actions taken. The claimant is informed that the matter has been resolved but not of the user’s identity.

Under the DMCA, the college is not held responsible for students’ misuse of the network vis-à-vis illegal use of copyrighted material.
