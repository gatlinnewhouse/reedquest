_**By Reed Student Advocates**_

If you’ve ever been angry about sexual assault at Reed, you’re not alone. Yes, despite the Reed community’s positive attitude toward upholding the Honor Principle, and for the most part practicing it in earnest, there are still members of our community who victimize others via sexual assault and other forms of emotional and/or physical violence. That these acts still happen on campus should anger any reasonable Reed community bystander, personal ally, survivor, or administrator, if not make them soberly aware that our community as a whole can and does fail to live up to the HP’s standards.

Despite this, it may feel difficult, even paralyzing, to think of how to respond when a sexual assault effects&#8211;however directly or indirectly&#8211;our lives.  How should we position ourselves toward, define and prioritize the needs of those who have violated another’s psyche and/or body in addition to those who have been subject to this unjust treatment? How should we systematically respond to these incidences such that we can do justice to all parties involved?  Reed Student Advocates, a totally student run group whose advocates are trained by the Portland Women’s Crisis Line in survivor advocacy, aims, alongside Reed’s J-Board and Honor Council, to address these questions.

We know from experience that it’s fair to ask, then, how exactly we do this, and to question the qualifications that justify us to be doing this work, as well as whether we can actually offer confidential support. To respond: our advocates currently operate an anonymous, confidential voicemail-callback system to provide callers with emotional support, connections to Reed and Portland resources, safety planning, and support for allies. Our advocates respond to all calls within 24 hours.

Speaking more to issues around confidentiality:  though we welcome the recognition and media-related support we have received from the administration in order to increase awareness on campus of the services we provide to callers (see Mike Brody’s article next door), for the sake of being excruciatingly clear to the Student Body, we stress that RSA’s advocates are neither affiliated with the administration, nor paid employees of any of its offices (you can verify with Mike, if you’d like). As such, we are not mandated reporters, and we will not report sexual assaults UNLESS a caller requests for us to file a report, or we become aware that a minor (under 18) has been assaulted, in which case it is considered child abuse by Oregon State Law.

As for training, all advocates have 40+ hours of advocacy training through the Portland Women&#8217;s Crisis Line. Topics covered in training include: safety planning and emotional support skills, trauma, domestic violence, referring to local resources, and what the reporting and judicial processes look like, as well as more conceptual discussions about oppression, the culture of sexual violence, and gender identity.

RSA follows a model of empowerment, prioritizing above all else the needs of the caller. We strive to help regain or maintain callers’ peace of body and mind through at least verbal support or safety planning. In addition, we understand the consequences that can come of reporting sexual assault, and we are prepared to help survivors and their allies come to an informed decision about whether they want to report (e.g., via explaining the J-Board process, the post-report timeline, and potential risks involved with reporting, etc.).

We believe that our work complements that of J-Board and Honor Council.  Dedicated to reconciling the law, the Honor Principle, and college policy, these groups perform a great service to the community by questioning the related status quo, mapping out improvements to an official process, and being directly involved with changing policy.  While their work is important to maintaining a climate of honor and justice in the aftermath of sexual assault, as institutions they are not designed (nor should they be) for the unconditional support of a survivor.

Additionally, we work alongside the Health and Counseling Center, another confidential resource on campus. Among the many services it provides, the HCC’s staff of professional counselors serve as an invaluable source of emotional support and, if requested, as a liaison to other resources, for anyone in the Reed community affected by sexual assault. The counselors are confidential except in rare cases when the immediate safety of an individual or the community may be compromised; in addition, some counselors are mandated reporters of child abuse.

While a number of dedicated groups on campus are working together to eradicate sexual assault and to help find healing for those who have been hurt by it, we cannot accomplish this without the support of every member of the Reed community. We hope that you will choose to take action; if you are passionate about alleviating these issues on campus, consider joining RSA! We are always looking for new members to be trained in advocacy, as well as members who support the group through event planning, logistical management, and outreach.
