Dearest _Pamphlette,_

I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t respond sooner to your proposal. I didn&#8217;t mean to snub you; I just had to take some time to think about this. I was flattered to be called your idol, and the rings were breathtaking. But I&#8230; well, I just wasn&#8217;t sure.

I&#8217;ve loved our time publishing together, but I just wasn&#8217;t sure if you&#8217;re there yet. Some of your stories can be very hurtful sometimes, and I&#8217;m not sure if you put in enough thought before you write some of your stories, or sometimes, indeed, any at all. It is true that some of your stories read as though you wrote them drunk the night before you went to press, and sometimes you end up resorting to all your old defense mechanisms – writing lists, talking about how stressed you are, and of course, making fun of me – when you&#8217;re having trouble coming up with anything funny. I also don&#8217;t know if you understand the value I place on punctuation, spelling, and grammar, or if you&#8217;re even aware that such things exist.

I also have to admit that I&#8217;m a little scared myself. I&#8217;m a lot older than you, and, I have to be honest, a bit fatter. While I sometimes have trouble fitting into my eight pages, you can sometimes barely fill your two—even with highly pixelated stock photos stolen from Google images. I can&#8217;t help but worry that you&#8217;ll inevitably just leave me for someone else who&#8217;s young and thin like you.

But I&#8217;ve gotten past these things. Over the years, you&#8217;ve brought me endless joy. I know you&#8217;re younger than the 25 you claim on your masthead, but I can&#8217;t resist your youthful charm. I admit when I first saw your firm printer-paper sheets my newsprint felt as hot as it when I first roll off the printing press and as&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say I got to feeling more like paper pulp than dried fibers, and a publication hasn&#8217;t gotten me feeling that way since _The Griffin_ first came out. Sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to bring my exes into this; we&#8217;re&#8230; well, we&#8217;re over. We&#8217;re over. It&#8217;s over.

What I&#8217;m trying to say, _Pamphlette,_ is, yes, yes, I&#8217;ll marry you. Yes, yes, a million times yes! Just a couple things: If I think you&#8217;re just using me for my ad money, it&#8217;s over. And every time I let you fold yourself between my pages, you&#8217;d better laminate yourself. (I still have suspicions about that one night we shared—the CSO Blotter does look just like you. I don&#8217;t need any new features right now.)

I can&#8217;t wait for our life together, _Pamphlette._ I can&#8217;t wait to wake up together, and I can&#8217;t wait to make you breakfast. You can tell me what you think of the news stories I&#8217;m working on, and I can help you think of things to put in your list of what happened when Aristotle met a sexy iguana or whatever it is you write about. I can&#8217;t wait. Forever yours,

_The Quest_
