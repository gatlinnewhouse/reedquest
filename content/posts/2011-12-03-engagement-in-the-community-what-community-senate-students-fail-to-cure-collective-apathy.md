“Reedies are the first to complain and the last to do anything,” said Student Body President Nora McConnell-Johnson in a recent interview. McConnell-Johnson claimed that the student body is partially at fault for failing to engage itself in student government and student groups. “Reedies have time that they could be using. They have to want to use it.” However, she also held Senate responsible for low levels of student participation. Though, according to McConnell-Johnson, “Senate has the capability to do good work,” it has failed to engage the student body, particularly freshmen.

But McConnell-Johnson was quick to declare that Senate has made progress. Past Senates, she claimed, were “clique-y” and “silencing voices” rather than providing a public forum for discussion. Senate dysfunction peaked in October 2009, when, in a row about a leaked email, it voted without precedent to remove Senator Katy Joseph ’11 from office. In a speech given in an SU “at full capacity,” Senator Jose Palafox ’09 summarized Senate’s reaction to the leak: “We broke into camps, distrusted each other and were frightened.”

On the topic of Senate cliques, current Senator and Vice President Elect Aidan Sigman admitted, “There were a disproportionate number of Rugby players on Senate.” Questioned further, Sigman said, “With this coming term, if there ever was a Rugby hegemony, it will be broken.”

At Senate Meeting on November 14th, Sigman reported that in a recent discussion he and Mike Brody toyed with the idea of making some form of community involvement mandatory for freshmen. In the following hour of debate, both Senators and student observers were divided about the issue. Sigman stressed that the idea is “totally in its infancy.”

“I think that conversation would not have happened on campus five years ago,” said Student Activities Director Kristin Holmberg. She continued, “I think that [in the past] there were a lot of very independent people involved in very independent things.” Students now are “more community-centric.” However, said Holmberg, implementing Sigman’s proposal would require a new staff member and the creation of a logistical framework from scratch. She added, “Senate could jump up and down until they’re blue, but unless people want to get involved, it will never work.” According to Holmberg, Senate’s function is not clear to much of the student body. “I wouldn’t describe it as byzantine, but there’s so much information that it is hard to get a handle on it all. A challenge is helping the random student understand how involvement in X committee affects the community.”

Multiple solutions have been proposed. Cheez-Its have already made regular appearances at weekly Senate meetings as part of an effort by McConnell-Johnson to encourage attendance, and snacks will become a line-item next semester. Both McConnell-Johnson and Sigman suggested posting agendas ahead of time and summarizing meetings in SB Info. “Senate’s obstacles are related mostly to advertisement. Senate Beat is not enough,” said Sigman, who claimed the weekly feature in The Quest is biased and not read by enough of the student body to be an effective intermediary between Senate and students. At Senate meeting on Monday, Senate discussed hiring an “executive assistant” to promote Senate publicity by, for example, managing the recently created Senate Facebook page. Some Senators will begin holding office hours next semester, and Senator Sarah Carlisle said that she would be working to make SIN more accessible.

Holmberg suggested that Finance Committee hold multiple signator training sessions per semester because,  as she said, “some people are intimidated by the funding process.” Holmberg is currently lobbying for a new position in the Student Activities Office focused on outreach to student groups. “We’re treading water right now. I think that we’re doing our best, and we’re doing a good job, but I want us to be doing a great job.” A new position would allow the SAO to help student groups create institutional memory. Currently, Holmberg said, groups must relearn how to attract and keep members with each new leader. “Students are always recreating the wheel in student groups.”

McConnell-Johnson admitted Senate suffers a similar problem. “We don’t have all of our documents up to date in one spot.” Members of Senate don’t always know if they are implementing the most recent version of a given bylaw. Past initiatives to improve student accessibility to Senate, like wearing microphones and projecting a speakers’ list during meetings, have largely been forgotten.

However, student involvement may be on the rise. An uncommonly large fraction of the student body voted in elections last week, fifty-four percent.
