Dear Reedies,

I always thought hell would have more burning and sulphur. Instead, it seems characterized by an inability to focus, a terrifyingly large goal, and the unfortunate certainty that whatever I do is insufficient, sub par, or both.  Knowing that I purposefully designed this semester’s course work to be lighter, different, and engaging doesn’t help.  It just makes me wonder where my previous ability to focus has gone. Did someone steal it?  Is it cavorting in summery fields somewhere, finding smelly things to roll in, snapping its jaws at butterflies and eating grass until it pukes?  I don’t know. But I do know that I would welcome it back, no matter what it’s been rolling in, no matter how many burrs are matted in its fur.  If you see it, please tell it to go home and find me.  I need it to take its leash again and drag me out of here.

Sincerely,
  
Henry White
