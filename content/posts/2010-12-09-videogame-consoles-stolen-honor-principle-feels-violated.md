On Monday, Dec. 7, Andrew Choi and Rebecca Richman reported three video game consoles belonging to Reed’s resident video game collective, Handling Controllers Collaboratively (HCC), stolen.

Choi and Richman were in the middle of arranging a video game rental program with the campus bookstore at the time of the theft. If all went according to plan, students would be able to borrow a video game for no charge using their Reed ID. However, when going to check on the Ping Pong Room cabinet where the games and consoles are stored, they were greeted with empty shelves and only a severed cable to indicate that the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Wii had ever been there.

According to witnesses, the suspected perpetrator is a white male who was wearing a baseball cap, sweatshirt, and carrying bolt cutters the day of the crime. The consoles had been cable-locked to the cabinet, though the cabinet had been left unlocked by the group. According to the official Community Safety report, the total cost of the theft is approximately $720, and the crime has been reported to the Portland Police Bureau.

“Not only does it suck for us, it sucks for the entire student body,” says Choi, who expresses his determination to keep running the group as seamlessly as possible despite the setback. “It’s not something we can’t overcome.”

Based on the last time the consoles were seen, Choi believes they were stolen at some point over the weekend. It is speculated that the perpetrator is a member of the Reed community, or someone close to the community, as the location of the equipment is not public knowledge. The reason for someone wanting to swipe the consoles, however, is more than confusing.

“The systems would have been available virtually 24/ 7, so stealing them to play… doesn’t make much sense,” says Richman. “The value of the systems is lowered due to the cable loops epoxied onto them, so resell doesn’t make much sense, either.”

“It’s disappointing that we have to take such drastic measures to protect our stuff in a community ruled by the Honor Principle[&#8230;]”says Choi. From now on, he says, HCC will be using U-locks to keep their things safe.

“In addition to looking ridiculous, the fact that such excessive precautions have to be taken is absurd and disheartening,” says Richman. “We like playing videogames, so we thought we would make that accessible to all the other Reedies who like to do so as well… What happened to the Honor Principle?”

Until Senate can approve for funds to purchase replacements for the stolen items, Choi and Richman will be using their own personal consoles for the group’s use.

Video games will be back in the PPR for use relatively soon. Members of the community with any information that could aid in the recovery of the missing equipment are encouraged to contact Community Safety as soon as possible.

“I am really disappointed, almost to the point of being disgusted,” says Ariel Dooner, a member of Honor Council. “Like, really, guys? Really?
