**Surviving the Witch-Hunt: Battle Notes from Portland’s 82nd Avenue, 2007-2010**
  
**Reviewed by Andrew Barney** 

Surviving the Witch-Hunt is a scathing condemnation of the now-defunct “Prostitution Free Zones” in Portland. Author (and sex worker) Emi Koyama uses material ranging from Yahoo! Group posts to police statistics to essays by herself and other activists in this fascinating zine. She builds the case that the creation of PFZs was informed by racist and classist beliefs, by the self-serving perspectives of local homeowners, and by simply faulty information; that they reduce the bargaining power and safety of sex workers; and that they overlook underlying social and economic realities. Koyama suggests that we ought to address the lack of acceptable housing and health care (among other things) faced by people on the street before imposing harsher penalties on sex workers in an attempt to “help” them.

This zine was written by an activist in conjunction with the 82ndCARES Coalition. Though its scope is commendable, it is not a comprehensive treatment of the subject. However, this shouldn’t detract from the quality and importance of this zine at this point in time in particular: not only is International Sex Workers’ Rights Day this Thursday, but a group of Portland business owners is once again agitating for the creation of Drug and Prostitution Free Zones in this city.

**On the Poverty of Student Life**
  
**Reviewed by Alex Lane**

On the Poverty of Student Life is an essay originally distributed in France in the 1960s. Though antiquated at times, this essay speaks to the modern if one only goes so far as to change out names, places, and pop culture references. In dealing with the French liberal arts student of 1966, the Situationlist International almost perfectly describes the Reed student. Everything from swallowing obscure, intellectual pop culture wholesale to “refashion[ing] his very ordinary indigence into an original “lifestyle” and becomes a shabby bohemian.” On The Poverty of Student Life should be a required read for all incoming freshman. It is at least a brief glimpse into an absurd past, and at most a questioning of ones own originality.

This publication angered me, and others. It is no small wonder that, at the location of its original distribution, it caused the student union to be closed. It is, however, a necessary anger. If students fail to study the shortcomings of past student culture, they will surely parrot them.
