Over the next several months, community safety will be increasing efforts to secure computers and other expensive equipment in academic buildings. These efforts come as a direct response to two massive technology thefts in the Physics building, both of which cost the college thousands of dollars in lost assets.

The second of these thefts occurred on April 10, and resulted in the loss of laptop computers, iMac desktops, and other scientific equipment. Last week, the Quest reported that community safety was conducting an investigation in tandem with the Portland Police Bureau. Since then, the investigation has led to several arrests and the recovery of two lost computers. On April 14, director of community safety Gary Granger sent out a message to the Reed community informing them of the investigation and its progress.

Granger explained that the involvement of the Portland Police Bureau is the result of an ongoing police investigation of an active group of burglars close to the Reed campus. Due to their familiarity with the group, Portland Police were able to recover computers and make arrests from secondhand information they received.

“The problem is that we are only a mile away from chronic burglars and drug users,” said Granger. “Additionally, Reed is a Mac campus, which makes us a prime target for thefts because those computers go for twice as much.” Granger also noted that other technology-related dorm thefts were “probably” related to the same group of burglars.

Granger said that community safety has “short term” and “long term” goals for improving security in academic buildings. Short term efforts include shortening hours in academic buildings and installing alarms on expensive pieces of technology. The former was instituted last week in the Physics and Biology building, which also now are more rigorously enforcing swipe card access. The latter is currently used by A/V for video projectors, which have also been subject to thefts in the past.

Granger was still uncertain as to what buildings and laboratories would be subject to community safety’s new security measures. “We’re going to be looking at the places that make the most sense in terms of security,” said Granger.

Long term efforts include a campus-wide security risk assessment, which is scheduled to take this summer. Granger hopes that the risk assessment will help community safety readjust their efforts to secure buildings and patrol campus more effectively.

Granger states that the goal behind these efforts is to not make buildings “burglar-proof,” but to deter burglars from attempting to break in. “We have to make it actually harder to break in, but we also have to make it look harder,” he said.

Moving forward, Granger states that greatest concern is the safety of community members. He stated that students and CSOs were present in the Physics building during both of the break-ins.

“That is what is most frightening to me,” commented Granger. “It’s the idea that during either of these break-ins a student or CSO could have encountered someone will do whatever it takes to not get caught.”
