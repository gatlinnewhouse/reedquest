With this year’s Renn Fayre fast approaching, many of you are no doubt in the process of planning your attire for the weekend’s festivities. Given this year’s theme, and its grounding in “The Old West,” I’m sure many of you may be tempted to buy in to the trends fed to you by American Apparel and Urban Outfitters and go find yourself a sweet Native American headdress and slap on some war paint.  I’m here to tell you why you absolutely shouldn’t.

The use of the headdress and other forms of regalia by non-Native people helps to further the stereotypical vision of Indians, as we have been portrayed for years by white America.  The picture of Indians as loin-cloth-wearing, headdress-sporting, teepee-dwelling, bow-and-arrow-tomahawk savage of movies and television has little to do with actual Native culture, and disrespects the lives and struggles of the modern Indian, many of whom are still living in poverty and oppression on reservations all across our country.  By perpetuating the stereotype of the Indian, you deny the existence of actual, real-life Native Americans just like me and many of your fellow students, faculty and staff at Reed.

Additionally, ceremonial regalia (which, for many—but not all—tribes includes various incarnations of the headdress) holds sacred significance for many Native people.  Regalia is worn in traditional dances and spiritual ceremonies, and carries a strong meaning for those who make and wear it.  Regalia is not a blank signifier.  Regalia is not a costume nor a fashion statement.  By using it as such, you are playing into cultural appropriation, and you are disrespecting the long-held traditions of Native people.

Finally, dressing up and “playing Indian” is akin to performing in blackface.  Regardless of your intentions, you are using stereotype to portray yourself as a race you are not; and this practice has never, and will never be acceptable.

I know many of you will not be convinced by this argument. You will say that this is not cultural appropriation, and try to give me a thousand reasons why it isn’t offensive.  However, I ask you, as Reedies, and as people of good faith and a sense of honor, to think about these issues before you begin your search for your Renn Fayre wear this year.  Consider your fellow students, staff and faculty at Reed who are proud Indian people, and who may be saddened to see their culture degraded in this way, but who may never say a word to you about it.  Make good choices, and we will all have a great Renn Fayre.
