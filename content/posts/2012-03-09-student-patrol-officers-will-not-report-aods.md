Amid student ire, Community Safety [announced last week][1] that it would not proceed with plans for a controversial Student Patrol Officer program that would have had student volunteers reporting AOD violations on other students to Community Safety.

Appearing at last week&#8217;s Senate meeting, Director of Community Safety Gary Granger cited widespread discontent about the issue as the primary reason for the the program&#8217;s suspension.

The announcement confirms that student opinion has a tangible effect on the actions of Community Safety and the administration. Granger said at the Senate Meeting that mutual trust between students and CSOs and a sense of common purpose was necessary for Community Safety to accomplish its mission.

The program, which was announced early last month as a cheaper alternative to the privately hired Pacific Patrol Services, planned to use volunteer students to patrol campus, lock and unlock buildings, and, controversially, report AOD violations to Community Safety. It was met with an angry response by the Student Body, including a _Quest_ Op-Ed by the Blue Heron Infoshop and a poster campaign that compared Community Safety to the draconian Hogwarts High Inquisitor in the _Harry Potter_ book series. At last week&#8217;s Senate Meeting, students raise concerns about threats to safety of the SPOs and decreased trust between students.

Granger reported that while the program may continue in a different form, it will definitely not include students reporting AOD violations.

Community Safety has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that requires that it at least address any minor violation of law, and deal with more serious infractions accordingly. This MOU gives Community Safety jurisdiction over Reed campus. Without it, campus could not remain police-free. The MOU required that the administration cooperate with the Portland Police Bureau on the recent campus arrests. When a student is found to be using illegal substances or drinking underage, AOD violations are the minimum level of response not in violation of the MOU.

It is considered necessary to have a student volunteer program to alleviate the burden on Community Safety. Community Safety fears that it currently lacks resources to most effectively keep the campus safe otherwise. However, Pacific Patrol Services, hired in response to the two campus muggings last semester, is too costly and is currently being funded by the college itself, not Community Safety.

However, compromise will be difficult. “There doesn&#8217;t seem to be an obvious easy answer to how we comply with both the letter and the spirit of the MOU, and still create a program that students can get behind,” said Granger. Though Granger expressed hope at Senate that some “latitude” could be allowed, he also noted that the job of SPOs must be explicitly codified.

Despite this, Granger says he remains “optimistic” that Community Safety will be able to resolve the conflict. “I will start by having my team take a stab at a revision that will probably include response options,” he explains, “and then get interested students to review the package, and then set up a meeting to walk through the options.”

“I have no idea how we will get past these current vexing issues,” he said, “but so long as students are willing to engage on this and bring their energy and ideas to the work, I can&#8217;t imagine we won&#8217;t be able to find a way.” “This is new ground,” he added, “so it will likely take some time.”
