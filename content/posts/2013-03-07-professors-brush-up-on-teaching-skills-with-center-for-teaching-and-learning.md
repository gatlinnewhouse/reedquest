A new series of teaching seminars for professors commenced last month with a workshop led by  Mariatte Denman, Ph.D, associate director for the Humanities at the Stanford Center for Teaching and Learning.

These seminars are part of a larger effort to establish a Reed Center for Teaching and Learning after the college was awarded a $100,000 grant for that purpose by the Mellon Foundation in 2011. Those involved in the process have been working on organizing events like the one held last month, bringing visitors to the college, and also visiting other colleges that already have established centers.

Sonia Sabnis and Kathy Oleson, professors in the Classics and Psychology departments, respectively, organized last month’s seminar. Sabnis says that “in the Humanities, [Reed professors] have the opportunity to see each other’s lectures but do not have the chance to visit each other’s conferences,” and says this program will help professors understand how different teaching strategies work inside the classroom.

Participation in last month’s event was entirely voluntary, but both Sabnis and Oleson were encouraged by the strong turnout from faculty members with a wide range of experience. “New and experienced professors can come at it differently and get different things out of it,” Oleson says.

The seminars are meant to teach skills and strategies associated with educational motivation, mastery goals, and learning for learning’s sake. When the participating faculty met a week after the seminar, Oleson says, they discussed “adapting strategies to Reed and different types of classes with an understanding that there is no correct way to run a conference.”

Oleson was inspired to find ways to improve her own teaching after reading a recent _New Yorker_ article, “Personal Best,” in which Dr. Atul Gawande, one of the most well-known and highly respected surgeons in the country, described reaching a plateau in his development as a surgeon. Dr. Gawande decided to bring in a retired general surgeon to watch him during surgery and help him improve.

“You’re opening yourself up to criticism,” says Oleson, “but you have to acknowledge that’s how you get better.”

In the follow-up meeting, many faculty said they wished that Denman had spoken for longer, and that they were eager to discuss the seminar amongst themselves. “So far, the response has been really positive,” says Sabnis.

Even with the strong support of those who have been involved thus far, the Reed Center for Teaching and Learning remains a pilot program, and its future is unclear. The pilot grant does not provide enough funds for establishing a fully functioning center, so further funding is required.

One other possibility involves professors sitting in on other professors’ conferences. Although that has not been the standard, “the Mellon grant includes a pedagogy workshop in which faculty visit each others’ conferences and there seems to be great interest,” Oleson says. Visiting others’ conferences would offer the sort of feedback that both Oleson and Sabnis agree could be constructive and would help professors see a wide variety of conference styles in action.

The Center for Teaching and Learning might also be integrated with current academic support for students. By working with tutors and other services offered through the DoJo, the center could help professors help students reach their academic goals.
