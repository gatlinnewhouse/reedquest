In a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Science at Harvard on May 11, attendees passed a simple motion stating that “unless an instructor officially informs the Registrar by the end of the first week of the term” that they intend to offer a final exam in a given course, “the assumption shall be that the instructor will not be giving a three-hour final examination.”

Under the old policy, the faculty handbook included steps to petition for a waiver of finals room reservations, implying that all courses were expected to conclude with a final exam unless otherwise specified. The passage of the May 11th motion will require instructors to actively request a room for their final exam, prompting of a reversal of expectations regarding testing.

An article entitled, “Bye Bye Blue Books?” in the July-August issue of Harvard Magazine, quotes professor of English Literature and Comparative Literature James Engell raising the pertinent question of effective assessment in an undergraduate atmosphere increasingly less regulated by objective testing. He instead poses the challenge of how professors are meant to differentiate between extraordinary and average work in the absence of objective standards like test scores or senior assessments.

There is no doubt that this decision has received such a degree of national attention simply because of it took place among the faculty of Harvard. However it highlights a trend across academia that has its roots in the debate surrounding the pedagogy of undergraduate education.

While final exams are still commonplace in math and the hard sciences at Reed, the vast majority of professors in the Division of the Arts and of History and Social Sciences instead end the semester with a final paper or project related to the overarching themes of the course. Practices vary within Literature and Languages and Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and Linguistics.

Chris Roberts is a visiting professor of Religion and Humanities, specializing in Western religious thought. Beginning his fourth year at Reed, Roberts regularly includes a final exam in his courses Sacrifice Gift and Exchange (REL 254) and Post-Reformation Christianities (REL 163.)

While a fan of the conference-based learning style of most Reed courses, Roberts soon realized the potential downsides of assigning only open-ended work. “I noticed that a smart kid at Reed could essentially mine a seam through the course without getting out of their comfort zone,” he says.

In introductory courses this was especially problematic. Some students had a tendency to use class time or written assignments to elaborate on a theme they already felt comfortable with instead of gaining a working understanding of basic concepts.

Roberts suggests that an exam can shake a student’s personal convictions in a way that conference participation or paper writing cannot.

By integrating a number of participation techniques into the overall curriculum, students with a variety of learning styles each have their own opportunity to excel.

“Just like a good piece of music you some harmony and some dissonance,” he explains, adding, “An exam is only one element of the total coursework.”

Furthermore, all students don’t approach class time in the same way. “Conference is so good because it puts a premium on expression, but there are times when that expressivism can overshadow the collaborative aspect of education.” As a result, he says, he doesn’t penalize especially shy students that do not easily contribute to classroom discussions.

Roberts’s approach has met with mixed responses from students. Many have expressed displeasure with the idea of both a final exam and paper at the end of the semester. But Roberts insists that he is open to alternative solutions and, though exams appear to be on the way out at Harvard, certain professors will undoubtly remain loyal to their evaluative capabilities there as well.
