Back by popular demand: Reed Energy Wars!

During the 2011-2012 school year, Reed spent $1,389,150 on energy alone, that’s $1,029 per student! Not only does this take money away from many of the wonderful programs we love at Reed, it is also harmful to our planet. Let’s do something about it.

In this competition, created to encourage sustainable living among students, the area group that decreases its energy and water usage the most during a three-week period will be deemed “The Most Honorable Energy Warriors,” and receive an edible award during reading week. Area groups will earn additional points for hosting events such as discussions, sustainable potlucks, and movie nights, so HAs and residents work to together and talk about what you would like to see happen on your floor. Although the competition is limited to the residence halls, students living off campus are encouraged to collaborate with on-campus friends in planning events. The competition started Monday, April 15 and ends Friday, May 3.

[Here is a website][1] with tons of resources on why these types of competitions are important and with event ideas (links to films you can screen, discussion questions, things like that).

PSU did something similar and did awesome. Let’s beat them!

“As a result of the competition, UP Res Halls reduced energy use by nearly 24,000 kWh hours (what 4 U.S. households consume in a year), averted 10,900 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions, and saved $1,673 in energy costs. The winning dorm reduced their use by 24%!”

A few tips on ways live more sustainably:

  * Turn off unnecessary lights
  * Use a powerstrip to completely shut off power to computers and other appliances.
  * Use daylight rather than electricity whenever possible
  * Adjust computer setting so it goes into standby after 5 minutes of inactivity
  * Swap out your incandescent lights for a CFL
  * Air dry laundry instead of dryer
  * Take the stairs
  * Turn off lighting in hallways, bathrooms and common spaces
  * Because chargers pull power even when not connected, unplug appliances that are not being used to eliminate phantom loads
  * Share mini-fridge with neighbor or use common room fridge
  * Keep windows closed when using heat or AC
  * Wash clothes in cold water
  * Take less than 5 minute showers
  * Turn off water faucet when brushing teeth or shaving
  * Run the dishwasher full
  * Talk to your fellow residents about conservation efforts
