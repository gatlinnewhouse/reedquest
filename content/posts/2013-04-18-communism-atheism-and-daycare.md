Campus may soon be bolstered by the addition of a Child Development Center by spring 2014. The center would provide daycare with an educational focus for children ranging in age from infancy to four years.

After 40 faculty members went to the Physical Plant committee in November 2011 to assess the feasibility of a child care center on campus, former President Colin Diver appointed an ad hoc committee on child care to look into a center. Since then, Reed faculty members have observed child care centers at other liberal arts colleges, and a consultant was hired to determine the feasibility of the project. The committee plans to send a proposal to the president’s office by the end of May.

Last year, the committee sent out a survey to faculty and staff to gauge the amount of general support there was for a childcare center on campus. According to the survey, the number of children of Reed employees was 50 percent larger than in 2004. Of the respondents, 75 percent said that they would be likely or very likely to use a child care center on campus – and 74 percent of respondents who sought child care reported having some sort of problem arranging it.

One selected comment from the survey that was included in a letter from the committee to Diver read, “…I have been employed full-time the entire time I’ve been a parent. Twenty-four of those years was at Reed. I can say the most difficult, stressful and worrisome aspect of being a working parent was the child care piece…”

Another comment read, “Since in our culture much of the child care…still falls primarily on women, you put your female employees (and single parents, or parents whose partners work out of town or state) at a particular disadvantage by not providing child care at work.”

Managing Editor at Public Affairs and member of the committee Stacey Kim says the results were “not surprising, but encouraging.”

On April 3, the committee emailed students, faculty, and staff a second survey in an effort to gain a more concrete understanding of the type of center the community desires in terms of student employment and faculty and staff priorities. The committee is still in the process of analyzing these results.

According to Chair of the committee Gail Sherman, Reed would not directly subsidize the childcare center, except for the provision of janitorial staff and a space on campus. The committee has yet to work out how faculty and staff members with lower salaries would still be able to use the center.

Kim explained that with the addition of the theater next year, rearrangements in facilities are already expected to occur. The proposal for a new childcare center “fits in with the conversation about campus priorities,” Kim says.

Sherman said that the committee is considering three locations for the center: Prexy; the DoJo; or in the building on the corner of 28<sup>th</sup> and Steele, which is not currently owned by Reed.

“I think that childcare, as President Obama said in his State of the Union address, is one of our greatest unsolved problems,” Sherman says. “I would love for Reed to be a part of that solution.”
