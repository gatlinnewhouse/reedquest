Minds for Revolution, a new organization started by Lina Shadrac ‘15 and Erica Meadow ’13, seeks to add a historical and social perspective to psychology at Reed. “Psychology has an incredibly problematic history as a discipline,” Meadow says. &#8220;Psychologists and psychiatrists have been involved in the performance of non-consensual lobotomies, the pathologization of gay people, and assisting the US military in torture. Many of the attitudes that led to historical atrocities continue unquestioned in psychology today,” Meadow says. “To gain a perspective on these aspects of psychology we decided to do reading on our own and invited others to do so as well.”

“Currently, the mainstream psychological establishment pathologizes trans people and condones the undue influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the creation of diagnostic categories,” Meadow says. “Psychology often individualizes oppression, telling members of oppressed groups that their problems are rooted exclusively in their own minds, lives, and family situations without considering the wider sociopolitical forces that cause and add to mental distress.  I believe that psychology has liberatory and radical potential, but that in order to reach this potential, we must question its historic roots and current, problematic attitudes.”

An example of how this liberating branch of psychology could be used is in cases of patients suffering from PTSD, according to Shadrac. “It’s not as simple as saying an individual has PTSD, we need to solve a societal issue and not have them deal with it on their own. By examining the history of psychology we can see how these social constructions have mutated over time, been allowed to persist and shaped psychology as a whole.”

In recent years, psychology attempted to assert itself as an empirical science at the cost of parting from its history as part of the humanities. “The papers we are going to be discussing will not all be written by psychologists, but will attempt to offer a synthesis of approaches,” Shadrac says. Looking to reunite the discipline with other elements of the humanities, interest from non-psychology majors has encouraged Shadrac and Meadow thus far.  “We are hoping the club will be collectively driven, with all participants contributing ideas for future readings. But we also realize everyone is busy and the club will be structured to allow for more liberal individual involvement,” Shadrac says.

Minds for Revolution is currently holding weekly meetings and assigning reading assignments.  Meadow and Shadrac have already held one meeting and two other information sessions and are planning to meet next on Sunday, April 7, at 1 p.m. in the Psychology Lounge.
