Gary Granger is a visual learner. “I process things visually,” Granger says, pointing a large map situated in the middle of his office.

This map, referred to by Granger simply as ‘the board,’ tracks incidents pertaining to drug, alcohol, and bike theft across campus.

Granger codes these incidents with three different color pins: green, representing marijuana; white, representing alcohol; and black, representing bike theft.

Currently, the board has accounted for 66 drug and alcohol-related incidents.

“It gives me a better idea of where we should be focusing our efforts,” Granger explains. “When I look at places with no pins or a lot pins, I try to figure out why these places are different. What is about the geography or the flow of people that creates these types of focal points?”

Some examples of these ‘focal points’ are Sallyport, with seven white (alcohol) pins—which Granger attributes to events like 40s Night—and KRRC, with eleven green (marijuana) pins.

“Looking at trends like these helps us decide where we’ll patrol on a given day,” Granger said.

Granger suggests that tracking these incidents reflects his goal of transparency, and envisions the map as a communication tool for Community Safety.

Specifically, he mentioned that it could be a way to keep police from patrolling campus alongside CSOs.

“What will keep the Portland police convinced that they don’t have to worry about us is if they believe we are doing a really good job managing our own environment. I believe that when they see a map like that, what they’ll see is us paying extraordinary attention to the issues that we have,” Granger said.

Granger encourages everyone to come into his office, look at the board, and talk to him about it. “So far, it’s been a great way to share with students and the rest of the Reed community about how we’re modifying our approach to AOD issues. The policy hasn’t changed, but what we’re doing now is being more intentional about how we track these issues.”

Gary Granger now has a Community Safety blog, which you can visit <a title="Community Safety blog" href=" http://blogs.reed.edu/reed_blogs/community_safety/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">here</a>.
