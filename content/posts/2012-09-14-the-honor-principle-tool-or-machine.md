_The following is an exclusive outtake from_ Comrades of the Quest: An Oral History of Reed College, _by trustee John Sheehy &#8217;82._

The intended purpose of Reed’s Honor Principle was to suspend the college in a state of perpetual tension. By choosing not to codify it, as other schools had done, Reed’s founding president, William Trufant Foster, sought to make it more a tool of freedom than a machine of authoritarian enforcement.

This was in keeping with his adherence to the pragmatist philosophy of John Dewey and William James, in which ideas were to be employed as tools, not immutable truths, and ideology viewed with skepticism. For the Honor Principle to be relevant, Foster believed that it must remain provisional and contingent in the ever-changing composition of the Reed community. To define it as a code would be to violate the creative spirit of operating in what he called the “here and now.”

Where some saw an ambiguous ethos of integrity in place of traditional hard-and-fast rules, Foster saw freedom. The Honor Principle was to be in a sense Reed’s version of the Zen koan “What is the sound of one hand clapping?” It didn’t advocate rules; neither did it advocate no rules. Instead, it occupied a paradoxical middle ground between rules and no rules, not abiding in either but ideally incorporating both. This left the community free to examine and debate its own ideas of honorable conduct without having to unthinkingly conform to a set of ethical and moral expectations imposed upon it.

For Foster, this principle of self-reliance was the basis of freedom—but not freedom as license. Much like his design of Reed’s academic model—where the pursuit of intellectual freedom required rigorous discipline to instill a method of open and critical thinking—his quest for social freedom was disciplined by a sense of community responsibility. Foster assumed that individuals who truly valued the mutual independence afforded by the Honor Principle would subsequently restrain themselves from engaging in self-serving behaviors that exploited its fragility and undermined its vitality. In the anti-authoritarian, anti-traditional environment that Foster sought to establish at the college, this idea of responsible freedom became a source of perpetual tension.

That tension largely came in two forms: emotional and creative. To remain relevant in the transient student community, the Honor Principle had to be regularly re-examined and renewed. This became the true purpose of a Reed tradition begun in 1916—when a fire hose fight destroyed a good deal of furniture in the Old Dorm Block—that subsequently came to be known as the annual “spring crisis.” During such community flashpoints, the Honor Principle’s ambiguity generated an uncomfortable sense of vulnerability, and with it palpable sense of emotional tension.

Unaddressed, such tension often sought to eliminate itself by employing convenient strategies in removing the source of ambiguity. One strategy was apathy, an emotional bypass of seemingly benign indifference that served to undermine the Honor Principle’s intentionality. The other was ideology, often casting the Honor Principle through the familiar dualistic lens of authoritarianism and libertarianism, which sought to eliminate the contingency of its agency, allowing it to devolve into the machinery of rules versus no rules.

The challenge that the community repeatedly was left to wrestle with was not allowing the emotional tension of the Honor Principle to subsume the creative tension that it engendered. Foster’s quest for freedom relied upon the intimacy of community members engaged as “coworkers” in learning from each other and formulating a shared outlook that was altogether their own. A recognized authority on debate and argumentation, he viewed crises and confrontations as creative opportunities to engage in and experiment with this intimacy, and, in doing so, prepare the ground for the intellectual pivots of surprise and discovery that distinguish learning.

In the messy confusion that often ensued, Foster believed that through continual discussion, reflection, and negotiation the community had the potential to move forward on the aspirations it held for the Honor Principle. Imbedded in those aspirations was a confidence in self-reliance and risk-taking, two hallmarks of Foster’s freedom. The failure of a vibrant Honor Principle to take hold in the community ultimately threatened the promise of both.
