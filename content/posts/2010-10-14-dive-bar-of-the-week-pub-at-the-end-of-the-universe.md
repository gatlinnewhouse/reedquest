A lot of people are going to want to punch me right in the mouth for saying this, but the Pub at the End of the Universe kind of sucks. Well, maybe it doesn’t outright suck, but every time I have been there I have been neither over- nor under-whelmed. The Pub is just kind of whelming (is that a word?) or mediocre (that’s definitely a word) at best.

Here’s the thing: everything that the Pub does some other establishment does better. Fine, the Pub has really good beer selection. Whoopdefuckindo. So does the Horse Brass for the same prices, and the Horse Brass definitely isn’t a cheap dive. Hell, the Acropolis has better beer selection than the Pub, and there you can get a $5 steak and some boobies with your $4 pint of Guinness (or your $5 pitcher of High Life, what up!). I’m just sayin’.

The Pub will give you discounts on beer on certain nights if you have an OLCC handler’s permit or a food handler’s card, but so will practically every other dive in town. Additionally, having been a beer-only establishment until fairly recently (it got its liquor license about a year ago, I believe), the selection of hard stuff at the Pub is both kind of lacking and, frankly, overpriced. Even with happy hour specials and discounts, it’s never more expensive to drink at the Ship a few blocks up than it is to drink at the Pub.

All right, the Pub makes good nachos. I will actually give them that — those nachos are damn tasty. HOWEVER, they take at least 20 minutes to make it to your table, and the meat nachos, as I recall, will set you back fourteen bucks.

Fourteen dollars for nachos?! To borrow a phrase from the inimitable Cher Horowitz, AS IF!

I do have to give the Pub props for its badass lady bartender with the long red hair and cool hats (sadly, I don’t know her name, but she’s great), its sweet jukebox, and its relaxed atmosphere. The mazelike layout is pretty neat and definitely unlike any other place I’ve been to in town, but can make it awfully difficult to find the bathroom if you’re a wee bit on the tipsy side.

Long story short: The Pub kind of blows; other places are better. But that’s, just, like, my opinion, maaaan. Check it out if you want.
