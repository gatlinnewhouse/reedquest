I, as well as the CSOs that I am fortunate enough to lead, have been the subject of many _Quest_ pieces this academic year.  I accept it, I welcome it, and to this point, I have been impressed with the quality of work I have read. Not today.

I quote from the aforementioned piece:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  “ . . . many students have asserted that in acting upon these [AOD] policies, the administration is doing away with the Honor Principle and trust-based nature of the community.”
</p>

Hold that thought . . .

I have also been the target of anonymously authored posters that, while humorous in their presentation and amusing to my daughters, seem to be the antithesis of the intellectual heritage and aspirations of Reed.  I quote from the Guidebook to Reed Mission Statement: “The goal of the Reed education is that students learn and demonstrate rigor and independence in their habits of thought, inquiry and expression.”

Neither the anonymous assertion in the piece, nor the anonymous posters represent a rigorous form of inquiry or expression. Rather, I place them both in the same category of anonymous name-calling.  Moreover, when directly quoted statements from staff are counter-balanced by the use of the purported sentiments of “many [unnamed] students,” the writer has simultaneously elevated anonymous complaints (meaningful critiques come signed), while diminishing the quality of community discourse to which Reed aspires.  Finally, I critique the editorial comment at the end of the piece:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  “As of the past week, issues concerning CSO misconduct . . . have been an issue of contention between students and college administration.”
</p>

For _the Quest_ to publish such an assertion without attribution, without explanation, without any representation of the CSO perspective, and without a single specific description of “misconduct” is, at best, hyperbolic.

If there are students with specific concerns, I hope they will address those concerns in the spirit of the Honor Principle and bring them to me in-person so that they can be addressed.  My office is in 28 West and students with opinions are always welcome.  I am open to any and all questions and critiques from any student willing to share. Invite me to the Paradox, and I’ll buy the coffee while we talk.

Postscript: I shared my critique of Jacob’s piece with him before submitting this for publication.
