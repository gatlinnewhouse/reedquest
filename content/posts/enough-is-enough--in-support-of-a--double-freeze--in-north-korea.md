Enough is enough. The ordeal between the U.S. and North Korea has become a “pissing contest” at its finest hour. The mainstream media promote the idea that North Korea is a rogue nation hell-bent on the complete nuclear annihilation of the U.S.. Not only is this the general idea of the media, but it is reflected in the way that policy is being written. In _The Chicago Tribune_, on September 4, 2017, it was reported that Nikki Haley, the ambassador of the U.S. to the United Nation, believes that North Korea is begging for war. In _The Guardian_ on April 17, 2017, it was reported that Mike Pence said, “North Korea would do well not to test his resolve.” Such words help give the impression of the U.S. as an umpire and a peacekeeper, but one who can be pushed to the limit. 

Except, that isn't what is taking place. At the same U.N. conference where Nikki Haley so boldly stated that North Korea is begging for war, something even more extraordinary happened. This something is called an attempt at diplomacy. The policy is called, “double freeze.” It has been worked on by China and North Korea; Russia has even taken part in helping ease tensions. Well, what is a double freeze? In this case, North Korea would stop testing nuclear weapons and the U.S. would stop its military drills in South Korea.  One would think that this is an ideal situation and that the U.S. will and should take it. But what does Nikki Haley think? She stated in the U.N. conference, that the idea of “freeze for freeze is insulting” and that “you do not lower your guard” when a country has nuclear weapons and ICBMs. This argumentative stance is not new and has been seen before. 

Take the USSR in ‘52, when Stalin sent a series of overtures to the U.S. that proposed to expand the unification of Germany in order to prevent expansion of the Cold War. This was only on the condition that the U.S. do not arm themselves, because the USSR suffered the deaths of over 20 million from WW2. Now, since 1952 and now we have seen a lot of change in policy, that's a given. However, what has happened is this overall shift to the right by the Democrats and Republicans. In foreign policy, there has been a general consensus, especially by the GOP, that the U.S. has the right to use weapons and overthrow governments when they are deemed to be rogue.

Look at Iraq in that respect. The country was not compliant with U.S. wishes and was subsequently destroyed by textbook terrorism. Returning to the contemporary situation, what is it that causes the North Korean government to build up weapons? It could possibly be the constant military drills. Or it could be the increasing U.S. presence in the Asian Pacific, which may be what the Asia pivot, authored by Barack Obama and referred to by Hillary Clinton, looks like. One thing is certain, the U.S. and N.K. have almost brought the world back to October 2, 1962, when Kennedy and Khrushchev were mere moments away from destroying all life on earth.

One thing is rather certain, the U.S. and N.K. have the highest responsibility to not only act in a responsible manner, but to adhere to joint efforts to help bring about world peace. Both countries have acted irresponsibly, and in that sense, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
