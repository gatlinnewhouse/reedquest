The beginning of the semester has seen changes to the enforcement of Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) Policy on campus. As a result many students have expressed uncertainty regarding the policy and its enforcement, causing rampant speculation.

“I’ve been hearing about students getting busted in sally port, which really surprised me,” one student said. “Last year, we hardly ever heard about CSOs busting students, except in extreme cases.”

Many speculate that these changes come as a reaction to the death of Reed student Sam Tepper, who died of a heroin overdose last year. In the weeks that followed Tepper’s death, the Reed community experienced extensive media attention and an investigation by the Multnomah County District attorney and US Attorney for Oregon. Some have also speculated that an increased effort to enforce the AOD policy comes as a result of the appointment of Gary Granger, the new Director of Community Safety.

Granger himself recognizes the changes being made to Community Safety and the enforcement of the AOD policy. “There was a paradigm shift. Somebody died last year,” he says. “The world’s attention was focused on Reed and its drug use. Now as an administration we have to take steps to make sure that students aren’t doing things that are against the law and that the community decides are dangerous.”

When discussing the nature of the changes made, Granger speaks to an effort on behalf of Community Safety to more aggressively track students related in drug and alcohol-related incidents. “The big difference here is that we are getting down everyone’s names,” he says. “If an underage student is caught drinking in Sallyport, we’ll write down their name. His or her name then goes in an incident report which we then send to the Dean [of Student Service’s] office.”

Granger adds that unlike in previous years, the names of students who are caught in groups violating the AOD policy will also be written down. They may or may not receive a citation.

While this policy does not differ greatly from the stated AOD policy of previous years, Granger intends to enforce the policies with much more effectiveness than his predecessors. “When we see you doing something that violates Oregon law or the AOD policy, your name will be put in an incident report,” Granger said.

When asked to compare the number of incidents reported between this and last year, Granger could only offer the number of incidents that were reported for this year, saying that Community Safety only began to systematically keep track of AOD-related incidents this year. “We haven’t catalogued AOD incidents regarding alcohol and marijuana [in previous years],” he said. “We won’t have apples to apples until next year.”

Granger also spoke to an increased effort on behalf of Student Services to act on AOD violations.

“If you are written up, you will most likely get a letter from Mike Brody [the Dean of Student Services],” he says. “The philosophy underlying these changes is to ‘never do nothing.’”

This idea of “never doing nothing” was also mentioned by one House Advisor who asked to remain anonymous. “During HA training, Mike Brody sat down with us and told us that by ‘doing nothing’ [about AOD violations], we are taking part in it.”

The HA went on to say that while House Advisors are not required to report any names, they are required to “say something” upon witnessing a violation. “This is different from last year in that the administration just wants us to be a lot more aggressive about it,” the HA said. “But it is not our responsibility to control drugs and alcohol usage in our dorms.”

These changes—unspoken or institutional in nature—amount to an effort on behalf of the administration not to curtail drug use entirely, but to more effectively manage it. “It is not my mandate to eradicate weed at Reed,” Granger argues. “It’s just to make sure that everyone is safe, and right now I feel like we are doing that.”
