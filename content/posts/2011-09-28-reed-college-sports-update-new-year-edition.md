Most of the Reed sports teams have continued as usual this year, with both Frisbee teams and both rugby teams gearing up for another good season, and basketball continuing to exist. Men’s soccer is looking to build upon their phenomenal previous season and improve upon their already extremely impressive last year’s second-place finish and .666 winning percentage. More on these teams to come later in the year as their seasons get underway.

The two big stories in Reed sports, however, are the emergence of Reed’s crew team and the struggles of women’s soccer to maintain a team. Reed crew started up last year, but this year the team has really matured and should push for a league title this season.

Said coxswain Megan Bradley, “the team is legit this year.” Bradley, who but for an ill-timed bout of acute laryngitis would have coxswained at rowing nationals in Peoria Il., this past summer with her local rowing team, admits to having been apprehensive when she first came to Reed about finding a crew team that fit her high standards, but has been pleasantly surprised by the Reed crew experience.

Unfortunately, unlike the crew team, women’s soccer has struggled to attract enough players. After a difficult season last year in which a key player left the already short-handed team to play for men’s soccer and they couldn’t field enough players to play in an outdoor 11-a-side league, the team began this year with the news that their coach had been let go and their future as a Reed sports team was in limbo.

However, there has been a resurgence of interest in the team. This resurgence coupled with the fact that the league the men’s team plays in no longer allows women because playing against women made certain teams in the league uncomfortable (I’m looking at you, Mt. Angel Seminary!), means that the women’s team should be able to regroup and reorganize and have a successful season.

As of press time, the men’s field hockey team continued to not exist.
