Mat Olson &#8217;15 and Sean Howard &#8217;13 are excited about the future, and justifiably so: they are planning the publication of _The Pamphlette_&#8216;s first competitor in recent memory. Their paper, called _The Pudding_, is meant to be a humor paper that looks beyond the Reed bubble and reminds Reedies that laughs can be found everywhere. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to deemphasize the need to stay within the context of Reed. The reason for printing an article should be that it&#8217;s funny,&#8221; said Olson of _The Pudding_&#8216;s focus.

This intense focus on one specific subject matter is in fact what motivated Olson to depart _The Pamphlette_, explaining that, &#8220;the thing about _The Pamphlette_ is that a lot of it had to be about Reed, and Reed is a tough subject and a tough audience. [_The Pamphlette_] tries to always have content about Reed, and sometimes it&#8217;s not the greatest source for humor.&#8221;

&#8220;Why would you try to squeeze blood from the stone? You shouldn&#8217;t be trying to do that,&#8221; Olson adds.

Olson also says that he felt limited by _The Pamphlette_â€™s __fixed format and weekly publication schedule. &#8220;There are times when I&#8217;d finish an article and tell myself, &#8216;This is not good.&#8217; The articles had to be in a certain style, and attention had to be paid to layout and you had to collaborate with other people, and we had to do that on a weekly basis. The fact that every week we had two sides of legal paper to fill didn&#8217;t work for me as a creative process.&#8221;

_The Pudding_, by contrast, will adopt a flexible and irregular publication schedule to allow its writers more creative latitude when coming up with ideas for articles. The authors will have as much time as they need to think and write about whatever subject matter they want, and _The Pudding_&#8216;s staff hope that this will make for a funnier paper overall.

&#8220;I liked the idea of a flexible format and layout, an erratic publishing schedule. It means that when we do release [issues of _The Pudding_] we can be proud of them,&#8221; Olson says.

_The Pamphlette_ writers have different theories about Olson&#8217;s motives for departure from the publication.

&#8220;The Pudding founders were corrupted by the irresistible lure of absolute power. It&#8217;s destroyed stronger men than they. Nothing about _The Pamphlette_ needs improvement. It is a godlike entity that can do no wrong. _The Pudding_ is like Lucifer, rebelling,&#8221; said Elizabeth Crisman, a writer for _The Pamphlette_.

Olson, for his part, defended the need for a new publication, and denied that reform of _The Pamphlette_ was the right solution to the problem of an unfunny humor paper.

&#8220;If we tried to do these things to _The Pamphlette_, it wouldn&#8217;t be faithful to its original intent,&#8221; he said of reform. Olson explained that _The Pamphlette_ was a rich Reed tradition that he did not feel comfortable usurping, and that he felt the Reed community would be better served by a new publication instead. While it remains unclear when _The Pudding_ will finally emerge from creative gestation into print, Olson and Howard remain confident that their paper will be a worthy competitor.

&#8220;With the Pudding, we can say that we&#8217;re standing behind everything that we publish,&#8221; Olson says.
