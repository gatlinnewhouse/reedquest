  A tug-of-war between nature and nurture is alive and well inside each of us. At precise locations throughout our bodies, genes, hormones, and growth factors compete to instruct embryonic-like stem cells to adopt specific behaviors. Sometimes stem cells are pushed to proliferate (make more copies of themselves), and at other times they are pulled toward differentiation (transforming into specific types of cells with distinct functions). Because stem cells retain the capacity for both proliferation and differentiation, they make prolonged tissue growth and repair possible.

The longer a tissue grows, the more likely its cells are to proliferate uncontrollably—a hallmark of cancer. Uncontrolled proliferation is often linked to changes in genes that act within the cells that carry them (an intrinsic change), but uncontrolled proliferation may also be triggered by exposure to specific signals, like hormones or growth factors (an extrinsic influence). Today, scientists are providing new insight into the behaviors of stem cells by investigating how tissues grow. And importantly, the new results shed new light on the early events that contribute to tumor formation.

In a recent paper, which my Developmental Neurobiology conference discussed last week, scientists examined fish eye growth and used a mutant with defective eye growth to tease apart the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic growth signals. Zebrafish are a good model for this type of investigation because they continue to grow from the day they’re born until the day they die. In one key experiment, the authors transplanted mutant cells into wild-type (normal) eyes. The mutant zebrafish always showed aberrant cell growth and reduced differentiation of stem cells. Because the mutant cells carried a lesion in a gene required for chromosomal segregation, the authors hypothesized that the mutant cells might form the beginnings of a tumor or be forced to die when placed into a wild-type eye. Neither happened. They found that the mutant cells behaved like their wild-type counterparts, differentiating appropriately and contributing new neurons to the eye. Essentially the wild-type environment “rescued” the mutant cell behavior. This surprising result suggests that the environment can guide dividing cells out of the cell cycle and toward differentiation, and that a cell’s local environment may be just as important as its genetic composition.

Unexpected possibilities often emerge from basic science research. In this particular case, the authors set out to study the consequences of a particular mutation but learned about the powerful influence of the local environment. Such studies also provide important starting points for clinically relevant research. According to the American Cancer Society, each American has about 40% chance of developing some form of cancer in his or her lifetime. Although this number has not decreased dramatically over the past 20 years, new cancer treatments, early detection, and behavior modification have dramatically decreased the likelihood of death due to cancer. There remains, however, a need to understand the cellular and molecular events that lead to the initial stages of cancer to prevent it from occurring at all.
