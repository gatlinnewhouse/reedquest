During finals, stress culture at Reed seems to be a terrifying beast.

Fortunately, Reedies ****have a wide set of tools at their disposal to help fight off and conquer their finals. The ****Dorothy Johansen House (DoJo) is one such tool, although most students don&#8217;t take advantage of it.

Freshmen may have a history of using the DoJo more than other students, and while it is true that ****41.5% of the students who signed into the DoJo during the 2010-2011 school ****year were freshmen, 41.5% does not amount to even half of the freshmen class. Also, Freshmen individually tend to use it less consistently than the upper-classmen, except the seniors, ****who have a good excuse: theses.

Throughout the 2010-2011 school year, the DoJo provided individual tutoring for 73 different classes, which totaled to a collective 1,518 hours of tutoring to the student body. For finals, the DoJo kicks everything into gear by doing ****its best to be available whenever and for whatever ****students might need it.

This year, the DoJo will be open for its normal hours (9 am-11pm) through the last days of finals. Drop-in tutoring will be optimized for finals by staffing ****tutors strategically in the nights before their respective exams. In addition, students will still be able to access the free 1-hour per week, per class, of individual tutoring until the last day of finals. Finals week is the perfect time for students to make use of this resource, especially if they have not done so before.

The DoJo offers resources for even those students who feel ready for their exams without tutoring. Julie Maxfield, Director of Academic Support, will be hosting a workshop called &#8220;Survival Skills for Finals&#8221; at the DoJo on Thursday, Dec. 8<sup>th</sup> from 3-4 pm. Items on the agenda for discussion include time management, staying sane and healthy, and executing goals for finals.

Beyond that, students can also schedule individual appointments with either Julie Maxfield or her colleague, Ryland Bell, the Quantitive Skills Center coordinator, to discuss strategies concerning this semester&#8217;s completion.

Julie provides the following study tips to help students survive their ****finals:

• Break work into manageable pieces. &#8220;Study for Bio&#8221; is not a single task and the size of that to-do can be overwhelming enough to induce procrastination.

• Schedule some social activities.  It might seem counter-intuitive, but you&#8217;ll need people-time. Putting friends on your calendar gives you something to look forward to and helps you avoid the temptation to ditch your work for hanging out at non-scheduled times.

• If you&#8217;re starting to fade or lose focus, change something- the subject, the task, the location, the strategy, etc.

• Take care of your body.  (Little known secret: your brain is a part of your body.)

Julie wishes students the best of luck with their exams.
