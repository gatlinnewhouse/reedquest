The pool hall is a different place at in the early morning hours. This is the first conclusion I reached at 4:30 AM on Thursday, Nov. 29. I had volunteered to write a _Quest_ article on a late-night custodian who plays pool in the pool hall with students on his break. So yes, I admit, the whole thing was voluntary. I was interested, drawn in by the mystique of this mythical pool-playing custodian.

I talked with Michael Carbone, a freshman who frequents the pool hall at the custodian’s preferred hour who only heightened my desire to meet him. He told me, “he always makes jokes while he’s playing, he’s really funny and always goes for the most difficult shots. Before he sinks the eight ball he hits it on as many rails as possible, goes out of his way to make it challenging for himself.”

I set an alarm, woke up at 4:30 and went to the pool hall. When I entered the room, blues music was playing loud and only a handful of people were there. I sat down on a couch and waited, falling asleep and wondering if he would ever show. In case you’re on the edge of your seat right now (though I can’t imagine why you would be), he didn’t. However I did manage to alarm some of the late-night (early-morning?) pool players who were (understandably) a bit confused by my catatonic still sleeping presence. Yet, being the determined, intrepid and intensely curious journalist I am (that’s right, I’ll toot my own horn), I was not to be deterred.

I set up camp in the pool hall again the following Monday from 2:30-5:00 AM, this time bringing back-up, my homework and lovely, considerate (keep an eye out for him ladies) friend and fellow writer Jordan Yu. We sat there in near silence for two and a half hours, looking up from our studies every now and then to exchange looks of extreme frustration and unquenched curiosity. And readers, I’m sorry to inform you, this elusive custodian once again neglected to put in an appearance. Which only piqued my interest and determination to corner him once and for all.

But now we were approaching crunch time. It was Tuesday, _The Quest_ goes to print Wednesday at midnight [_E__ditor&#8217;s Note: yeah, midnight, we&#8217;ll go with that]_ and there was only one issue left in the semester. I was desperate to find him. I even went so far to put signs on the doors to the pool hall with my number on them and an entreaty for him (or anyone who had seen him) to call me regardless of the time. (For better visualization of these signs I’ll go so far as to tell those of you who didn’t get a chance to see them that they featured scented markers and googly-eyed smiley faces. I mean, who wouldn’t call me after that?) I slept with my phone next to my head and set to “extra loud.” I woke up, this time at five AM and once more walked to the pool hall. The night was clear, with half a moon and a handful of stars and I’ll admit it, I was filled with hope; after all, this was my last attempt, surely he couldn’t be so evasive, surely he would have seen my notes.

This time when I reached the pool hall it was deserted. No music playing on the jukebox, no smoke hanging in the air, no gentle (or forceful—some of you are aggressive pool players) clinking of balls. I once again settled into one of the couches to wait. And wait. And wait. And I regret to inform you that he did not show up. I had to slink back to Bragdon, my metaphorical tail between my legs and my questions still unanswered. Which isn’t to say I’m giving up. I’m not. I will find you, talented custodian. And I will talk to you about why you play pool with students during your breaks, and how you got to be so good. Maybe I’ll even ask you to play a game. But, all of that must wait until next semester. For now I’ll have to make peace with my unslakable curiosity.
