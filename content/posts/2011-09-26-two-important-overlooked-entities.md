_A collaboration between SEEDS and PE_

Starting this quarter, Reed students can ‘cycle to service’ for PE credit. The class is a collaboration between the Sports Center and Students for Education, Empowerment, & Direct Service (SEEDS). Every Tuesday evening, students ride to the Community Cycling Center on NE Alberta Street. There, they help assemble cycles for the Holiday Bike Drive, a program that donates bicycles to children from low-income families during the holiday season.

Nick Pittman ’13, who is leading the weekly excursions, assures that “no prior experience is necessary.” He will be taking the scenic route along the river, rather than a shorter but more difficult one, to allow non-experienced cyclists to keep up. At the Community Cycling Center, mechanics will be available to show volunteers how to put together the bikes. Nick is confident that the skills students acquire will transfer easily to working on their own adult-sized bikes.

What prompted this collaboration in the first place? “It hadn’t really crossed my mind (to make it a PE class),” says Nick. He initially saw this opportunity as a SEEDS project when he took it to Fawn Livingston-Gray, the SEEDS Coordinator. Fawn approached Michael Lombardo, Director of Physical Education.

“People have been suggesting PE credit for SEEDS projects for a while,” says Fawn. “Rather than pulling ivy, students are cycling. Not that pulling ivy isn’t legitimate exercise!”

Michael was happy to help put together the class, stating that he is “up for anything that promotes healthy activities for you guys, positive socialization, getting off campus, getting out of the library, getting out of your heads.” He adds, “Some of the best ideas I’ve had for our (Physical Education) programs have come from students,” citing examples such as hoop fitness.

“To me, it’s totally logical,” says Nick of the collaboration. “PE and SEEDS service projects are two of the best ways for me to keep healthy and sane here. They are two of the most important, and oftentimes overlooked entities at Reed.”

Fawn also pointed out that many of the outdoor programs contain a service component. Will Symms, Assistant Director of Physical Education, Athletics & Outdoor Programs, has led trips for such activities as cleaning up the river in the early fall while rafting.

As of Tuesday 8/30, the class was listed as “Full” on SOLAR, the on-line registration system for classes. Nick will not be teaching the class again until the fourth quarter, when the weather will be best suited for resuming the class. He admits that the role of student instructor is “a little nerve wracking,” but is confident that everyone will have an enjoyable experience.

This is just one of many ways to be involved in either physical activities or serving the greater Portland community (or both!). For more information, take a look at the websites for SEEDS (http://www.reed.edu/seeds/) and the Sports Center (http://www.reed.edu/sports_center/).
