_**By Virginia Hancock, Professor of Music**_

I am very much troubled by two recent incidents that I fear show an unfortunate change in Reed culture.  They&#8217;re of very different levels of seriousness and their impact on the community, but I think similar in their disregard of what should be normal civilized behavior.

First is the destruction of the SU piano.  It was a beautiful instrument with a long history of service to music theory classes; it lived for decades in Eliot 416, where it was played by generations of students and many faculty members before it was acquired by the student body last summer.  That someone could wantonly and thoughtlessly deprive many more students of the pleasure of playing and hearing it is a hideous act of mindless vandalism.  I hate to think that any Reed-connected person could be capable of such an act—but it looks as though someone is.

Second is an experience I had yesterday morning  when I arrived at the front door of the new performing arts building.  I encountered a student (I assume a student from his age) who was putting out a cigarette on the pavement.  When he started to walk away without picking it up, I asked him if he intended to do so; he cursed me out with language that is certainly inappropriate to use with any stranger, let alone someone old enough to be his grandmother—although he did ultimately pick up the butt and take it away with him.  (There is in fact a cigarette disposal location within a few yards of where he stood.)  Yes, it was a minor incident and affected only me, but again it makes me sad that someone connected with Reed is capable of such uncivilized behavior.   Most Reedies are really good people and I would hope that there is no tolerance for this kind of thing.
