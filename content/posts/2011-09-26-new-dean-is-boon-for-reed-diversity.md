On July 18, 2011, Reed College announced the appointment of Professor Crystal Williams as its first Dean for Institutional Diversity after several weeks of deliberation as well as input from faculty, staff, and students. Her appointment marks a watershed moment as the college attempts to advance diversity and inclusion in all levels of the Reed community.

President Colin Diver informed the student body in a memo on March 15, 2011 that the college was creating a Dean for Institutional Diversity, and subsequently formed an Evaluation Committee chaired by Ellen Stauder, Dean of the Faculty. After receiving nominations from the community, the committee chose as its two final candidates Ms. Williams and Professor Mary James, A.A. Knowlton Professor of Physics. Ms. Williams began her new job on July 1.

Ms. Williams sees her appointment as a positive step for diversity and inclusivity at Reed, as well as a mark of pride. “We are among the first in the Pacific Northwest to have a _Dean_ for Institutional Diversity, and I think this speaks volumes about the college’s commitment in supporting our efforts,” Ms. Williams said by email. Mike Brody, Vice President and Dean of Students, shares these sentiments with her. “In a time of historic economic downturn, when colleges and universities all over the country are laying people off, Reed created a senior level position devoted to diversity and inclusion.  In my view, this is both a meaningful statement about Reed&#8217;s commitment to this critically important aspect of the College&#8217;s future, as well as a concrete and practical step to move us forward in the near-term,” Mr. Brody said by email. Mr. Brody expressed his confidence in Ms. Williams’s abilities, saying “Crystal has already begun to demonstrate a capacity to lead effectively the many students, staff and faculty who care deeply about diversity and inclusion at Reed.”

As Dean for Institutional Diversity, Ms. Williams is primarily a consultant to the college. “Logistically, I work with Colin, the VPs and Dean of Faculty, and their staffs to address systems, processes, and procedures that will further integrate the college’s diversity goals into their areas.” However, her position also has a concrete and meaningful element to the students, faculty, and staff. “I’m also charged with positively informing the campus climate to ensure that all members of this community are valued and included,” Ms. Williams says.  She also took time to discuss the new Dean for Inclusion, Engagement, and Success Santi Alston, as well as to mention that the college will “soon have a new multicultural resource center coordinator.”

Much of Ms. Williams’s past activist work at Reed is similar to the work she now does as Dean for Institutional Diversity. She has played a part in such past projects as the 2004 faculty resolution, the creation of the Black History Month program at Reed, as well as the proposal that Reed create the faculty position of Dean for Institutional Diversity.

This new position resonates with Ms. Williams not only because of her past work in diversity and inclusion, but also because of the work she has done as a poet both at Reed and in the past. “My work as a poet is, fundamentally, about isolation, race, class, alienation, acceptance, and forgiveness. The work I’m doing as Dean for Institutional Diversity strongly speaks to the kinds of issues I naturally think about on a day-to-day basis,” she says. As a poet, Ms. Williams has published work in Ms. Magazine, The Sun, Ploughshares, and the Norton Anthology of African American Literature.

As an undergraduate from NYU and a graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Williams’s experiences in school clearly guide the work she does today as both poet and dean. “My graduate school experience was not particularly inclusive. I was the only African American person admitted in my class cohort at Cornell,” though Ms. Williams says that “my undergraduate experience at NYU was fairly inclusive.” Her philosophy as Dean for Institutional Diversity is clearly one Ms. Williams has held since graduate school. “Broadly, I began in graduate school to develop a notion that diversity is not something that affects only a small subset of people. Rather, it affects _all_ people,” Ms. Williams says.

There are Deans for Institutional Diversity at Smith, Swarthmore, Middlebury, Williams, Wesleyan and Hampshire colleges. The deans at these colleges, including Ms. Williams, are members of the Liberal Arts Diversity Officers, a consortium of colleges dedicated to implementing diversity and inclusiveness among faculty, staff, and students.
