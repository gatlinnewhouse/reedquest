According to some awesome person who stopped me with the words “Hey! You’re that comics girl!” in the Theater Building last month, you probably all know me as That Comics Girl.

For the last six months, I’ve been holed up in Papaccino’s Coffee House working on my thesis comic. It’s been rough, it’s been tough, but it’s also been the most rewarding and awesome experience of my Reed career. If you’d told me I’d be drawing a comic in order to graduate from this school four years ago, I probably would’ve pshaw’d all up in your face. Yet somehow, here we are.

But now, Reed People, I need your help.

After spending all those hours writing, illustrating, and designing my 36-page comic, _True Believer_, the time has come to seal the deal and make this thing a real object that you can hold in your own two hands. And because I’m a classy dame, I want to make a real object that feels _fantastic._ We’re talking two-color screen printed covers on heavy black stock, classy French flaps, full color printing – the whole nine yards. But throw in the fact that I want to make 200 of these beauties and things start to get spendy.

That’s where you come in. I’ve had countless Reedies ask about pre-ordering or reading the comic, so this is your chance to make good on that enthusiasm. Last week I launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds so I can publish the comic the way it was meant to be published.

<a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/04/thesis-comic-to-run-on-crowd-power/tb_web_01/" rel="attachment wp-att-1514"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1514" title="TB_Web_01" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.reedquest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TB_Web_01-242x300.jpg?resize=242%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>For those of you who aren’t familiar with Kickstarter, it’s a creative crowdsourcing site. The premise of crowdsourced fundraising is simple. Backers pledge funds towards aspiring projects in reward for tiered incentives. In the case of Kickstarter, if a project does not meet its intended fundraising goal in pledges, backers lose no money and the campaign receives no funds. However, if the goal is met (or exceeded), backers receive their incentives and the project receives its funds.

So here’s the deal. I need $1,500 in pledges before graduation (May 14<sup>th</sup>). You can pledge anything from $1 (eternal gratitiude and a shout-out on my website) to $400 (eternal gratitude and a handwritten postcard, a signed copy of the comic, exclusive digital process material, a limited edition poster, an original page from the comic, a custom sketch, AND a personalized comic strip starring YOU). If it succeeds, _True Believer_ will be the first published thesis comic at Reed in almost two decades. With your help, we can make history.
