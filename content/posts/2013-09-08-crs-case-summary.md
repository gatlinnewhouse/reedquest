_The Community Rights Subcommittee (CRS) of the Honor Council is required by Honor Council code to send a summary report, not violating confidentiality, of any cases that arise to The Quest. This is a belated case summary from last spring.*_

_Spring 2012_

&nbsp;

The CRS accepted a complaint brought by a member of Student Services against several students alleging that the students engaged in a fight during a Reed sponsored event. As it is prohibited in Honor Council’s code to mediate in cases of violence, CRS decided to file a case with J-Board against the students involved. The Board found that one student initiated the fight by striking another student, and that several other students later sought out, hit, and kicked the first student. The Board recommended that the first student be suspended for one semester and be put on disciplinary probation, as well as complete community service and write letters of apology to those the student put in danger. The Board recommended that the students who sought out, hit, and kicked the first student be placed on disciplinary probation and complete community service. The president’s designee upheld these findings and recommendations.

The report shall contain a statement by the CRS of the method used to resolve the case and shall give an overview of the outcome. The relevant hearing board will publish summaries of issues resolved through adjudication and note that the CRS brought the case._
