On Monday evening, the Reed community received an open letter that seems to have raised more questions than it initially intended to ask. 

The letter, distributed in the form of a community-wide email, comes two weeks after a week in which seventeen Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) policy violations were reported by Community Safety. The relatively high number of violations during Paideia has led to uncertainty and concern among members of the student body and aroused public displays of criticism of Community Safety head Gary Granger.

The letter outlines an “external review of [the college’s] AOD policies, procedures, and implementation” through a review committee comprised of “the country’s leading experts in AOD education and prevention, treatment, and enforcement.” Although many details of the policy review remain undisclosed to the wider Reed community, the letter states that the review committee will visit campus to meet with students, staff, and faculty. After the review, the committee will submit a series of “assessments and recommendations” to Reed’s own Drug and Alcohol Committee, which is comprised of students and faculty.

Although the letter only specifies a time frame of “early 2011” for the review committee’s
  
campus visit, Dean of Student Services Mike Brody stated at this week’s Student Senate meeting that it will likely be toward the end of this semester. The Quest has also learned that the visit is expected to last three days. 

Director of Student Activities Kristen Holmberg, who is a member of the Drug and Alcohol Committee, stated in an email that the policy review would not have any immediate effect on the way the college implements its AOD policy.

“The external review will result in a report that we can use to decide what we want to do on campus,” said Holmberg. “We’re not required to do anything they say. We’re paying them to come and then we get to decide what makes sense for our campus.”

Holmberg also stressed that the policy review would not affect Reed’s ability to self-regulate and independently decide how to implement policy. “We often turn to other schools to see what they’re doing in a variety of areas. Academic and non-academic areas rely on colleagues and peers to help us stay current with best practices.” Holmberg’s assertion—that this type of review is not unordinary for the college—is one repeated several times in her committee’s letter to the community.

However, private and public perception of drug use at Reed is far from ordinary. This is reflected by recent efforts on behalf of the administration to end what was deemed to be, in years and decades past, negligence of the AOD policy. These efforts have amounted to a degree of concern among students as to the state of the Honor Principle and student independence and autonomy. 

Furthermore, the uncertainty created by the ambiguity in Monday’s letter seems to have only exacerbated this concern for some members of the community.

“It is a little scary,” said one student, who asked to remain anonymous. “You just have no idea what they’re going to be doing on campus.” One staff member also remarked that the letter’s ambiguity is “kind of weird.”

Stephen Metzler, signator of Students for a Sensible Drug Policy (but noting that he was commenting on his own behalf), is generally optimistic about the policy review, but stresses the imperative to ask questions. 

“I think a lot more information than what’s currently available needs to be considered before an opinion is formed,” Metzler commented. “The letter left a lot of unanswered questions: What are the details and specifics of the review’s procedure? How will students be heard? Who are the review committee members? What are the possible changes that could result from the review?”

Despite these question marks and heightened concerns, student senator Jenny Calvert-Warren is assured that the policy review can only yield positive results for the community, and suggests that an understanding of the way the Reed community manages AOD will lead to its subsequent validation. 

“Our student body is exceptionally intelligent and capable in many areas,” said Calvert-Warren, when asked for comment. “The policy review committee will get to see our enthusiasm and hard work, and I hope they’ll be impressed. Most likely, this policy review will bring a lot of validation to Reed’s unique intersection of policy and the Honor Principle.” 

Metzler agrees with Calvert-Warren in principle, and observes that a better understanding of Reed’s current treatment of AOD—what he calls the “status quo”—can be a positive thing for the community. 

“[At first] I was thinking ‘why should the status quo be altered?’, but I realized that the review itself aims at a precise understanding of what the status quo actually is,” he said. 

However, Metzler believes that in the face of uncertainty, the skepticism expressed by the student body is not only justifiable, but essential. 

“I do wonder why that understanding is sought, though, and what use that understanding will be put to.”
