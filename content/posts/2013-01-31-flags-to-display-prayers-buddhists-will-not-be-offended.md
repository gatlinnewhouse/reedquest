Students walking along the pathway between the Gray Campus Center and the Canyon this week will pass flags with prayers for everything from “Need Blind Admissions,” to “Commons George Appreciation Day.

The flags are part of a project by SEEDS, the Multicultural Resource Center, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, International Student Services, Residence Life, and the Peer Health Advocates. The project&#8217;s purpose is to “hear from the community directly about their thoughts on what the campus needed and should strive to become,” according to a press release from the departments. It will be displayed from today until Monday, February 11.

“The main question we wanted to ask,” says Dayspring Mattole, the MRC&#8217;s program coordinator, “is what would Reed look like as an equitable, inclusive, connected, and engaged community?”

MRC Intern Sita Goetschius, Associate Dean for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Jyl Shaffer, and Assistant Dean for Inclusion, Engagement, and Success Santi Alston, inspired by Tibetan prayer flags around Portland and on campus, researched the history of the flags and their meaning. “The three were interested in creating an artistic project that would provide education about Tibetan prayer flags and would use the symbolism of the flags for a positive, aspirational initiative for the New Year,” said the press release.

Although the project is not a religious one, “it was an important element to help our community understand something that might, to some, be seen simply as a decoration, but is really an important icon for Tibetan Buddhists,” said Shaffer in the release.

“They spoke with members of the local Tibetan Buddhist community to ensure that the project would be both culturally appropriate and in the spirit of the meaning of the flags to the Tibetan Buddhist community,” the release said.
