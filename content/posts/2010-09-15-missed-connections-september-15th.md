[#5] I‚Äôm growing tired of playing games, lover of mine. It‚Äôs time for the ironic baseball caps to come off, you sexy piece of Texass. How do you say ‚Äúcuddlehumps‚Äù in Greek?

[#6] To L.:
  
I adore your dark aura. It drives my soul off the brink&#8230; Take my
  
modest advances, and respond as you, the lady of the night, see fit.
  
Eternally yours,
  
Library Admirer
  
P.S. You‚Äôre fit.

[#7] Luna Lovegood,
  
You know who you are. Everyone who you speak to falls in love, but they don‚Äôt admire you like me. Stop alphabetizing in the mailroom and find me. I will show you true magic.

[#8] Blonde, shaved on one side. SOOO HAWT. I want to see more of you. You are to my loins what a lemon bar at commons is to my stomach.

[#9] Girl with the blue hair. Freshman. Rock my fucking world.

[#10] To: Ben Nortey
  
You‚Äôre super cute + quite the badass. Do you still have that girlfriend back home?

[#11] He was dressed like a kindergardener but he looked like a sexy 43-year-old. I could stare at his dreamy unshaven face and gaze into his deep librarian-style-glasses clad eyes, hazel with a glint of somber sensibility. As he poured me out my coffee he exuded such maturity and good Jewish breeding that my heart was aflutter. I‚Äôll come to the p-dox every Sunday at six with the hope that one day, finally, he will notice me. <3

[#12] How tall are you? Tall enough to have the stars in your eyes. You seem miserable. Let me make you happy. üòâ üòâ

[#13] To the boy with the same essence as my boyfriend&#8211;I need a supple, innocent replacement when my boif is occupied with thesis woes. Don‚Äôt let the age difference throw you off &#8211; I can teach you the sensual pleasures of ‚Äúolde‚Äù Reed. Bring your signature white thermal and broody brow and let‚Äôs get started.

[#14] I¬† told you to find me after Thesis Parade. You never did. Don‚Äôt¬† make me wait another year to take you home.
