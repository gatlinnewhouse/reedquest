For many, _Eurydice_ represents one of the greatest stories of a promise broken and a love unfulfilled ever told in literary history. Indeed, Orpheus’ looking back at his beloved Eurydice is a scene that still resonates with readers today for its tragic pathos, and for its graceful evocation of love, loss, and the ties that bind. In Ovid’s _Metamorphoses,_ the story was originally told from the Orphic perspective; however, in Sarah Ruhl’s 2003 adaptation, _Eurydice_ both literally and figuratively takes center stage, giving theatergoers a fresh take on Eurydice’s character and the tragic events of the myth. Theater professor Catherine Duffly will be putting on a production of this unique perspective in Reed’s Mainstage Theater on April 5, 6, 11, 12, and 13 at 7:30 p.m.

The play’s reservation webpage promises “a meditation on language, love, and memory” in which the comic, the tragic, and the merely surreal are brought together on the stage in such a way that the play both imitates and parodies lived human experience. The viewer is forced to confront the bitter and inevitable choice that comes with the end of something good when Eurydice is brought into the Underworld and meets her father &#8211; and forced to decide between staying with him, or retuning to Orpheus so that they might be united in marriage.

It is this tension that lies at the heart of the play, and a Reedie-based exploration of this unique theme will surely resonate with an audience that, it can be argued, is itself in a transitional state in which treasured things must be left behind to move on with life. This resonance will surely be amplified by the fact that Ruhl’s script leaves significant room for interpretation regarding the set design, and can be adapted to have relevance to its unique audience demographics.

Regardless of the directorial decisions made, the play will be sure to interest Reedies given it’s foundation in Ovid and classical mythology, and its themes that deal with the ineffable difficulty of growing up and moving on.
