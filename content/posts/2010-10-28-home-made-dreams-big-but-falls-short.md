There comes a point when art being avant-garde for the sake of being avant-garde becomes overly abstract, and loses the interest of the audience.

While Home Made starts out as a beautifully intimate portrait of human exploration, it begins to waver and veer off in unexpected, but not necessarily appreciated, directions. The piece begins to lose coherence and the end result is something that seems underdeveloped &#8211; the dance was conceptually interesting, but didn&#8217;t come together in the best way physically.

That said, Keely McIntyre and Noel Plemmons are captivating and versatile dancers that manage to maintain the attention of viewers simply by being so unabashedly involved in their movement. They have true chemistry as dance partners and are a joy to watch.

Home Made, according to Angelle Hebert, the choreographer, “is loosely autobiographical.” Inspired by a tumultuous long-term relationship, the piece “is really a constant negotiation of control and independence, tenderness and hostility, manipulation and affection, connection and loss. [It’s about] constantly negotiating those ideas and the struggles in relationships.”

Nudity in dance, while not as shocking as it was decades ago, is still somewhat shocking. Naked dancers suffer from the fact that their absence of clothes can be an unwanted distraction, so it was interesting to see Hebert play with this level of discomfort by almost mocking it (Noel, at one point, is simply jumping up and down, and his wagging male anatomy makes for a semi-humorous little joke). “[It’s] not that Noel is ‘man’ and Keely is ‘woman’; the roles are constantly shifting,” says Hebert. Overall, though, it appears that Hebert was relying more on the nakedness factor in the presentation and less on actual movement &#8211; which was disappointing, and leaves audiences feeling bored but obligated to continue watching simply because, well, the dancers have no clothes on.

The work’s musical accompaniment is gorgeous, to say the least, and the lighting brilliantly accentuateed the movements of the dancers. Integration of video cameras and microphones into the work is innovative and fascinating, though at times slightly excessive.

The piece, according to Hebert, is “a deeply personal journey.” Unfortunately, this seems to also mean that the audience, unless privy to this journey, will ultimately be unable to really understand Home Made. Sporadic and confusing, its most beautiful and lucid moments are lost in a sea of pandemonium.

_Home Made will be running from November 4-7 & 11-14 at the mOuth (in Zoomtopia, at 810 SE Belmont). For more information and tickets, visit <http://www.tEEthperformance.com>. The performance, which contains nudity, is intended for mature audiences only._
