We would like to take the opportunity to respond to some of the concerns expressed by Director of Community Safety Gary Granger’s response to a news piece that was published in the March 10 issue of the Quest. We hope that, by writing this, we are able to adequately address his criticisms and shed light on our approach to reporting Reed’s new implementation of the AOD policy, as well as the debate surrounding it.

It seems as if Granger’s main criticism of last week’s piece stems from _the Quest_’s presentation of the debate. It should come as no surprise to Granger that these students, not unlike the “anonymously authored posters” he describes, would choose to remain anonymous. Whether these claims represent a rigorous form of expression, or the intellectual vigor that Reed supposedly espouses, it is representative of the persisting discourse about the AOD policy. In other words, the article is less representative of the rigor of the reporting than it is of the discourse itself. We stand by giving these anonymous statements the same weight as those of the administration members, and refute the fallacious notion that, in doing so, _the Quest_ has diminished the quality of the debate. Any evaluation of the quality of the debate is arguably a conclusion derived from what has been reported.

Why not, then, do away with anonymity in an effort to improve the quality of the debate?

Disregarding the fact that anonymity seems to be an integral part to the AOD debate, anonymous sources can lend much-needed perspective to a debate that often seems dominated by administrators, and even Granger himself. This is evidenced in this week’s top story, for which the students spoke on the condition of anonymity. It is important to note here that any expectation that _the Quest_ would qualify its information in a way that comprises anonymity stands alongside an expectation that _the Quest_ would be readily willing to subject itself to accusations of libel. It is also worthy nothing that, by using anonymous sources, _the Quest_ does not seek to present unverifiable information as fact.

In this sense, any suggestion that _the Quest_ should not have lent voice to these statements is nothing more than a value judgment similar to that which deems it be “name-calling.” Having said that, we understand and respect that, in writing this, Granger has privileged his professional interests over any sort of journalistic standard or conception thereof. However, it is extremely unfair to call into question the quality of an article if its presentation of fact is justifiable on a journalistic level.

We hope that the Granger’s frustration with the nature of the debate—something that we believe we have consistently framed with tact and accuracy—does not translate into a frustration with _the Quest_, simply because we have reported on it. We also encourage Granger to reexamine the body of work produced by _the Quest_ in the past academic year, in hopes he will realize that, in reporting news and accounting for fact, we have done in the same as him by privileging our interests as editors of _the Quest_, and will continue to do so.
