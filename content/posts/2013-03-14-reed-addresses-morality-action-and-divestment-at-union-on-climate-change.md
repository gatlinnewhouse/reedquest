A smattering of students, faculty, and other Reed community members gathered in Vollum Lecture Hall on Wednesday for a Reed Union on climate change. Officially titled “Climate Change: Policy, Advocacy, Science,” the Reed Union hosted a panel of five speakers, experts in different areas of study but all knowledgeable of the climate crisis. Each member of the panel made a presentation on the subject, followed by questions from the audience that touched on such topics as the morality of climate change policy, the difference between mitigation of climate change and human adaptation to change, the repercussions of climate change on the Pacific Northwest, and even Reed’s controversial investment in the fossil fuel industry.

Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Environmental Studies Julie Fry was the first to make a presentation on the science behind climate change. Fry focused on the future of climate science — specifically on black carbon aerosol, or soot, which she said creates two-thirds of the warming of carbon dioxide, making it the second-most warming agent in the atmosphere. “Uncertainty about aerosol drives uncertainty about future projections,” Fry said, because of the difference between reflective aerosols, which have a cooling effect, and black carbon aerosol, which has a warming effect. While carbon dioxide is long-lived, Fry explained that black carbon aerosol has a lifetime of about a week. “That’s what we want to go after,” she said. “We need improved understanding of aerosols to improve our ability to predict a future climate.”

Rob Scheller, an Environmental Studies professor at Portland State University, was the second to make a presentation. He emphasized that climate change has created an unprecedented “no-analog future,” in which “the past is no longer going to serve as a guide to the future.” He added that it is the burden of science to now help society mitigate the effects of climate change.

</p>

Assistant Professor of Political Science and Environmental Studies Chris Koski stepped up to the podium next. Koski rapidly explained the problems inherent in policy addressing climate change, describing climate change policy as a collective action problem in which the individual’s contribution is so small that they rarely change their actions. “Nobody wants to be the sucker, everybody wants to be a free rider,” Koski said. Despite that, state governments have addressed the problem in lieu of the federal government, which, with its refusal to enact climate change policy, has left a “power vacuum.” He painted two images of the future: one, a monoculture in which the federal government would enact cohesive policy; the other, a patchwork, reflective of the one that exists currently, in which states can enact legislation that might greatly benefit themselves and can pressure their neighbors to do the same.

Visiting Assistant Professor of History and Environmental Studies Joshua Howe made a case for the morality of climate change action. Howe explained that while climate change has usually been framed as a problem of science or economics, those participating in the climate change debate have relied too heavily on these tools “until we forget they are tools.” Howe added, “We have shied away from decisions in favor of numerical ends.” He concluded by reasserting the role of morality in the problem of climate change. “We need to decide what we think is the right thing to do,” which ought to take place along scientific and economic considerations, Howe said.

Bethany Cotton, J.D., an environmental lawyer working for Greenpeace, concluded the presentations. Cotton concentrated on local-level activism, specifically the Power Past Coal movement, and the positive impact it can make on the environment.

Maya Jarrad ’14 addressed the panel after the floor was opened for questions. Noting the obscurity of many of climate change’s effects, Jarrad asked, “At what point and how can we tie in advocacy for the things we can’t see?” Fry said that with technological advancement that allows faraway groups to communicate with each other, “groups of people can cease to be invisible,” and climate change effects are slowly becoming more visible as a result. Scheller added, “The realization that there’s no place unseen any longer is a motivator for my own advocacy.”

The prospect of human adaptation to climate change, as opposed to current mitigation, came up in the discussion as well. “There are questions about adaptation we haven’t asked yet…The academic literature is not really coming around to it. There’s a fear that if we start talking about adaptation, we start to give up on mitigation,” Koski said.

Howe added that talks about adaptation suggest that “we’re all in the same global boat. But we have differentiated responsibilities and capability to adapt, and many of us get uncomfortable when we talk about global inequalities.”

Austin Weisgrau ’15 later approached the microphone to address Reed’s investment in fossil fuels. He wondered “whether we have an institutional responsibility as a college to do actions like divest from fossil fuels.” Scheller responded that colleges and universities are the best place to begin this process, saying, “It is our duty to be leaders.” Cotton echoed his statement, stating that many colleges are divesting.

Vice President and Treasurer Ed McFarlane commented that Reed has a long-standing policy of promoting academic freedom, which means that the college avoids taking a political stand, including with its investments. Explaining that he was not taking a position one way or another, McFarlane said that the real debate is whether divesting from fossil fuels is really a political issue.

Later, Cotton added to applause that it is “unacceptable for an institution like Reed not to take a position.”

Finally, an audience member asked what the future of the Pacific Northwest will be because of climate change. Scheller said that, happily, the Pacific Northwest would probably experience the least change in the United States due to climate change, but that there will be “a lot more wildfires” and more rain in the winter instead of spring, which will most likely lead to the creation of more reservoirs. Howe added that, as an effect, there likely will be more dependence on hydropower from the Northwest as other regions will have less water.

Cotton concluded by saying that, although the land of the Pacific Northwest might experience relatively few changes, ocean in the area will not. “The Pacific Northwest is ground-zero for ocean acidification impacts,” she says.
