_Revived Dance is Intellectual and Emotional_

Barefoot, with their necks bent back to reveal crucial veins and arteries, the Reed dancers in Anna Sokolo’s _Rooms_ are completely vulnerable. Combined with the theme of the work, which is the trapped state of tenement residents of the 1950s, and a frightening feeling of desperation defines the atmosphere. It was especially contagious because the audience in Vollum Lounge was almost in the dance space. Emotion was fluid between dancers and spectators in a way that doesn’t happen in a classical venue. Two solos from the larger show were put on by Reed students for the last two weekends and will be performed again at the winter dance concert December 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>. They were performed amidst an exhibit on Anna Sokolo (the choreographer) on tour from the Dance Library of Israel.

The dances were set to jazz, meant to represent the emerging cultural freedom as a contrast to the tenement resident’s immobility. But even the tenements were a symbol of postwar national unease. The layers of symbolism were tied to a change in Sokolo’s style in the 1950s. Before that era she addressed specific social and political issues with her dances. Afterwards, and in _Rooms_, she aimed her work at the generalized discontent of the nation instead of specific politics. But her work was not only formed by her own perspective. She also took movements directly from her dancers&#8217; lives, experiences, and reactions.

The role of the dancer has become much more central to the interpretation of Sokolo’s work since her death. The two solos, “Escape” and “The End?” were read by two Reed students, Laura Krausse and Gabrielle Quintana, from Labanotation, a way of writing a dance as one writes music, with symbols that denote the nature of movement. Then their interpretations was coached by Suellen Haag, a representative from Sokolo’s estate who danced in _Rooms_ when Sokolo was putting it on. Haag changed every element of the dance, a testament to the interpretability of the dance and the desire to accurately revive the old dance.
