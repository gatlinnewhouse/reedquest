During the Fall of 2009, Senate agreed to allocate two percent of the Study Body Funds to the Sustainability Committee, a faculty-heavy group that is tasked with supporting the school’s quest to making our lives more green in whatever way it sees fit. These funds, on two different occasions (in the Fall of ’09 and Spring of ’10), have even been matched by the President’s Office, resulting in a total of $12,000. The hope is that this money will be used, said Senator Jenny Calvert-Warren, for “student projects that create tangible improvements in sustainability on campus.” This has in actuality only happened very little so far, and thus Senate has chosen to suspend any further investment into the fund this semester.

Senator Calvert-Warren noted two reasons for the decision: Firstly, Reed’s Community Constitution dictates (in Article I, Section 4) that all Student Body Funds are within the jurisdiction of the Senate, so permitting the group (with only two students on it) to use the funds as they please is “problematic.” Secondly, Calvert-Warren mentioned, “the Sustainability Committee has not made decisions in line with what the Student Body would like to see done with that juicy pile of money”.

She noted that last semester a student group came with a proposal to have a Permaculture Design Certification course on campus, but none on the committee voted for its approval except the committee’s two student members.

Calvert-Warren hopes this decision will cause the Sustainability Committee to enhance its advertising and open up more doors to student involvement with the fund. If this does take place, the Senate said that it is willing to re-invigorate the fund at the start of the next semester.

Additionally, Calvert-Warren mentioned in an email that “money for active organizations is tight this semester”. Torra Spillane, Head Treasurer on Senate, was quick to mention that after accounting for all the expenses in the Line Items (expenses that are written into bylaws, for example) and after allocating money to the Finance Committee (which comes out to $35,000), the resulting sum of cash always appears low. She noted (and this cannot be denied), Renn Fayre costs take up a significant amount of the Study Body Funds – so significant in fact that Senate takes $20,000 dollars out of its savings primarily to help with Renn Fayre challenges. This year, Student Body Funds came out to a total of $185,000. Of that amount, $105,590.40 were allocated to the Top 40.
