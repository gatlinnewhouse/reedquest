Members of the political science department have just returned from a meeting that has lasted for hours and are arguing about dinner. Left with only beer and tortilla chips for an entire afternoon, they complain to each other about the lack of edible compensation on behalf of the department.

“This is one of the problems with these search meetings,” Darius Rejali observes afterward. “We haven’t eaten, we’re all kind of arguing about things. People have so much invested in these tenure-track positions that if you do it without food, people get short-tempered.”

This year has seen a number of faculty searches commence across multiple departments at Reed.

Along with political science, searches are also undergoing in the art, biology, English, history, and Spanish departments. Next week, three candidates from Berkeley, MIT, and Cornell will visit Reed in pursuit of the new environmental political science position.

The position is one of two tenure-track opportunities available in the political science department.

Rejali, a professor of political science, chairs the ‘open search,’ a faculty search committee looking to appoint another tenure-track professor in the political science department. His committee is currently considering 320 “files,” or candidates who have applied. Such a number is not unexpected, much less at Reed.

“We currently have about 250 applicants and are expecting 500 when the deadline passes,” said Jay Dickson, a professor of English and member of his department’s faculty search committee. “It’s going to be one of the largest searches in the country.”

The English department is currently looking for a specialist in long-20th century American fiction.

Dickson is on the committing conducting the search, along with Maureen Harkin, Pancho Savery, Lena Lencek, Diego Alonso, and David Garrett. Search committees at Reed are usually comprised of tenured faculty within the department as well as another professor from the division. Garrett, a professor of history, is on this committee as a member of the Committee on Advancement and Tenure, which oversees the entire hiring process.

Dickson attributes the number of applicants partially to the fact that his department’s search—as well as that of political science—is for a tenure-track, as opposed to visiting professor.

“It’s much more desirable to have permanent positions which will perhaps last for the rest of your life,” Dickson said. “With visiting positions, it’s much more difficult because you often have to move for only a year. Many graduate programs are on the East Coast or the Midwest, and moving across the country can be really daunting.”

For many of these departments, their search for tenure-track professors comes as a result of an effort to be ‘staffed against leave.’ Two years ago, former Dean of Faculty Peter Steinberger put forward a proposal to add permanent positions to departments that frequently have a member of its staff on leave. The idea behind being staffed against leave is to offer a degree of academic consistency that cannot be attained by hiring visiting professors year after year.

“We were the only department that received two positions out of Peter’s proposal,” Dickson explained, “because we are the largest and have the highest enrollments in our classes.”

The first of these positions was filled by Michael Faletra last year. While Steinberger’s proposal provides a solution to temporarily vacated faculty positions, Rejali points to the long term effects of such a plan.

“Peter’s request has zero budgetary effects in the short run, because you would have been hiring others in the first place,” Rejali explained. “But in the long run, you would also need to consider effects such as salary increases.” Still, Rejali sees the plan’s benefits—such as consistency in teaching and “not having to run faculty search committee”—as outweighing the costs.

Unlike political science, the English department has not yet reached the point where they have begun to read applications. Every department has a different schedule for hiring faculty, and it is largely dependent on the timing of departmental meetings. For English and other language departments, their schedule relies on the annual MLA Convention, which occurs at the beginning of January. By then, the committee will have vetted every application and narrowed their search down to several candidates.

“Maureen, Pancho, and I will sit in a hotel room in Los Angeles [where the convention is held] and interview about fifteen to twenty candidates and choose three to bring to campus,” Dickson said.

As Dickson also points out, not every department has a national convention at which they can interview, so for some a short list of candidates is often just the result of extensive vetting. Rejali noted that his committees have used Skype to conduct interviews with outstanding candidates.

From this point on, the process is nearly the same for every department. Having created a short list of about three to five—the creation of which, Rejali says, occurs “by some miracle”—the search committee invites the candidates to campus to interview with twelve to fifteen other faculty members, have lunch with students, and give ‘job talks,’ lectures meant to demonstrate a candidate’s scholastic and instructive know-how.

“The letters we receive from students and faculty [after each candidate’s visit] go into the committees’ final decision,” Rejali said. “We want to pull everyone in. For example, the faculty may really like a person, but the students react poorly because they aren’t a good communicator.”

After this, the committee continues to deliberate, eventually selecting one candidate from those that visited campus. The candidate is then recommended to the Committee on Advancement and Tenure, who makes the final decision on whether to hire the candidate. Rejali describes a search committee’s final deliberations as “difficult” because it forces faculty to share their views about the future of the department.

“There is nothing more important than a tenure-track search,” Rejali said. “It changes the entire department forever.”

Dickson’s discussion of these candidates also suggests the gravity of decision: that one of them could, in fact, be at Reed for the rest of their lives.

“We need to make sure that they are a good fit for their entire career,” Dickson said. “Reed is a special place. We have to make sure first and foremost that whomever we hire for this position is devoted to instructing the best undergraduates in the country.”

Apparently, the candidates also seem to be aware of this.

“You wouldn’t believe some of the things they say about you,” Rejali said to his some of his students during class last week. “They want to come here and teach you so badly.”
