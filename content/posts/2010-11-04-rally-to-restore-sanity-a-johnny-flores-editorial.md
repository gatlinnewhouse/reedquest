From Judith Mowry:
  
We should replace judgment with curiosity and fear with hope.

From Kim Smith:
  
We need to become empowered and engaged; we matter.

From Richard Burke:
  
Curiosity is a bridge from fear to sanity.

Neuroscience lends itself well to Portland metaphors: The brain stem is the size of three Stumptown coffee beans, the cortex is the size of a bike helmet, and that other part is the size of a Cap’n Crunch Voodoo Doughnut.

It’s important that we breathe deeply, recognize the fear of ourselves and others, don’t pigeonhole people, and study empathy.

From the experience as a whole:
  
The Eastside Esplanade is a really great place to take a bike ride and meet some pretty cool people.

Furthermore, the inability to dance isn’t Reed specific; everybody in Portland dances like Elaine Benes.
