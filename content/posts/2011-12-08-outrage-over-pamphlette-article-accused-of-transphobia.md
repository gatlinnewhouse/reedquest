**Trigger warning: Discussion of sexual assault and transphobia**

Many students reacted angrily to an article in this week’s issue of _The Pamphlette_.  The article, written by Jeff Blum ’12, tells the awkward story of Ken explaining his lack of genitalia and ignorance about sex to Cindy, a woman he’s dating.  Many copies of _The Pamphlette_ were written on with red marker, with messages like “GENITALIA ≠ GENDER” and “THIS IS THE KIND OF RHETORIC THAT GETS PEOPLE KILLED.”  According to Stella Jones ’13, the article was “blatantly transphobic” because of its “portrayal of open prejudice against and shaming of a non-binary person” as well as mocking a real-life and serious problem faced by trans people.  One student who did not want to be identified by name noted that, according to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey 2011, 19% of trans people have been homeless, while 41% have attempted suicide.  Blum wrote a message to those who expressed concerns to him, explaining and apologizing for his article, and the staff of _The Pamphlette_ wrote an [apology statement][1].

One particularly sensitive issue on which the article touched was a reference to the movie _Boys Don’t Cry_, which portrays the 1993 murder of Brandon Teena, a transgender man.  Critics of the article pointed out that the article misidentified Teena as a woman, and Emily Due &#8217;14 argued that the article “makes light of his rape and murder for being trans.” In the article, Cindy compares herself to a character from the film.  Although she says that she would be accepting of Ken if he were transgender, she “can’t handle” his plastic, featureless crotch.

Shabab Mirza &#8217;13 argued that, although mainstream culture has done a better job of teaching people to reject prejudices such as racism and sexism, transphobia is not commonly recognized as a problem.  Ian Strahan &#8217;13 said that Blum&#8217;s article attempted to “show that Ken&#8217;s situation was different from that of trans individuals, and that trans people are normal while Ken&#8217;s complete lack of any sort of genitalia whatsoever is what&#8217;s not normal.  Unfortunately . . . it ended up kind of nastily transphobic.”  Teena&#8217;s murderers had forced him to expose his genitalia, which his murderers equated with his &#8216;true&#8217; identity before they killed him; in the article, Cindy discusses feeling Ken “down there” before panicking and yelling “ALL GUYS ARE NOT LIKE THIS.”  Sam Law ‘14 underlined the gravity of the subject: “Trans* folks are brutally assaulted and killed regularly in situations much like the one satirized.”

In his message, Blum apologized to those who were offended or upset by the article and clarified the intention behind it.  He acknowledged that he had misidentified Teena’s gender and made a mistake in referring to _Boys Don’t Cry_, and admitted that he had used the terms “pre-op transsexual” and “woman cross-dressing” inappropriately.  He explained that the humor of the article had not been aimed at trans people but rather at Barbie and Ken dolls, who are both “sexualized while simultaneously lacking the physical capacity to have sex.”  Separately, Blum admitted that he and the rest of _The Pamphlette_ had not anticipated any negative reaction to the piece, and that it was not meant to tackle a controversial issue.

Not everyone agreed that the article was transphobic.  Ben Williams &#8217;13 argued that “the piece was well within lines of taste.”  He explained that he had read the humor as directed at Ken’s ignorance and complete lack of genitalia, while the reading of those who had written on the issues of _The Pamphlette_ was “reactionary.”  Leaving the taste of the article to the side, Alex Lane ’14 suggested that the tactic of writing angry messages on issues of _The Pamphlette_ amounted to “publicly libel[ing] a member of the press in an anonymous and unaccountable way,” and called upon others to have “a public discourse on the article in question, albeit in a more democratic, less reactionary way.”  Strahan, however, expressed gladness that “other people were so dedicated to calling this out.”

The controversy was reminiscent of the firestorm provoked by two _Pamphlette_ articles in the fall semester of 2009, which made light of anti-Semitism.  Besides several articles in The Quest, President Colin Diver sent out a letter addressing the issue sympathizing with those who were offended by the articles&#8217; “remarkable insensitivity,” but upholding Reed&#8217;s principle of not censoring student publications.
