“Pretend that Reed has a gender studies program,” read the banner in Gray Campus Center advertising the Feminist Student Union&#8217;s Gender and Stuff Panel, or G.A.S.P. Although Reedies often do a lot of writing about gender, it never really sees the light of day because gender isn&#8217;t the focus of our classes, said Stella Jones &#8217;13, an FSU member and the creator of G.A.S.P. <span style="color: #1a1a1a;">“Especially in the wake of the comedy incident, FSU is renewing its efforts to reach out to the student body,” Stella explained, referencing a <a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/11/comedian-under-fire-for-comments-about-diversity-gender-equality-and-sexual-assault/" target="_blank">controversial performance</a> at a Reed stand-up comedy event.</span>

G.A.S.P., is a new and ongoing forum in which students can share and discuss their work on gender. In addition to showcasing students’ work, the panel intends to break through the Reed bubble by brining outside speakers to discuss local and global issues, said Eleanor Kinney &#8217;14, the moderator of G.A.S.P and a member of FSU. Because G.A.S.P’s objective is to address a wide range of issues, speaking slots are not limited to strictly gender topics, explained Kinney. Likewise Reedies do not have to present to participate in G.A.S.P., but can attend to watch and ask questions.

The panel, which will be hosted by FSU each semester, convened for the first time on Nov. 27 with four speakers: Jones, Arya Samuelson &#8217;13, AnnaLise Bender-Brown &#8217;13 and Christina &#8220;Blue&#8221; Crow, a local feminist &#8216;zine writer and comedienne.

Jones discussed the impact of fourth-wave feminism by reviewing the story of CeCe McDonald, a black transgender woman who was sentenced to 41-months in jail after being attacked by a group of _cis_-gendered white people and killing one of her attackers in self-defense. In response, a group of queer punks threw a Molotov cocktail through a Wells Fargo window. The thesis of the presentation was that targeting a bank was a relevant response because radical fourth wave feminism recognizes oppression greater than that of women, said Jones. The audience and Jones then discussed how the industrial prison system targets queer people and people of color since prejudice makes their imprisonment easier to justify socially.

Samuelson presented her thesis on sexual harassment and assault management in post-apartheid South Africa. Although South Africa has one of the most liberal constitutions in the world, it has the highest reported rates of sexual violence, Samuelson noted. The talk considered how the constitution has defined a “new women” with ensured rights that are respected by a “new man.” Samuelson argued that in her findings the constitution has been largely unsuccessful. “Political and legal change are not equivalent to social change,” said Samuelson. She also found that the forces causing violence in South Africa are different from those in the US. “The emphasis on healing through talk and catharsis doesn&#8217;t really work,” she added, noting that those methods had intensified sexual violence in non-Western contexts. The panel also discussed the inherent harm of binaries and the exclusion of male as well as transgender survivors in the scope of the policy.

Brown likewise discussed her thesis, which considered female genital cutting in Kenya and how it may be interpreted through a feminist lens (Brown&#8217;s thesis was <a href="http://www.reedquest.org/2012/10/cool-thesis-of-the-week-annalise-bender-brown/" target="_blank">profiled</a> in the _Quest&#8217;s_ Cool Thesis of the Week this semester). Brown’s work highlighted that most western feminists project absolutely that women do not have choice in the procedure and patronizingly label it “mutilation.” She argued that these judgments were rooted in colonialist thought and power-dynamics. Western feminists need to be critical of what values they apply to others and to be honest about commitments to those values, Brown advised.

Crow shared her personal experience in comedy to distinguish between being offensive and abusive. She concluded from her experiences that comedy clubs are usually not safe spaces for women, transfolks, and people of color. As a result she advocated seeking to change this dynamic or to create a new space altogether. Her presentation ended with advocating that FSU bring a feminist comedian to Reed.

_G.A.S.P will convene again next semester.
