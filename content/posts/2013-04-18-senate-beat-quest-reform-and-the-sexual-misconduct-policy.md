**Quest Reform**

For the second time this month, Senate discussed the _Quest_ board’s proposal for a new system in which editors are appointed rather than elected. The _Quest_ board provided an updated draft of the proposed _Quest_ bylaws, in which changes were made to the recall process. _Quest_ Editor Kieran Hanrahan began the discussion: “The primary motivation behind the reform is to maintain a higher quality _Quest_ over a long period of time.”

Senator Alden Jones said, however, “I can’t imagine a situation so bad that the student body would recall [_The_ _Quest_], but I can imagine a situation so bad that it would re-elect a different _Quest_.

In response, Student Body Vice President Paul Messick noted that “_The Quest_ is for the student body the only institutional memory that we have…Whatever would improve institutional memory needs to be considered.” While passing the proposed changes to the _Quest_ bylaws would mean eliminating an element of democracy, Messick said, “the benefits to the student body would go beyond this conversation.”

Senator David Azrael disagreed with Messick’s point and went on to argue that the effect of the changes would be “consolidating power out of the student body’s hands, into a small group.” He also expressed concern with judging quality: “People like really different things out of _The Quest_.” While the current board’s focus on maintaining a journalistic standard is great, he said, such a standard should not be imposed on future boards.

Building off Azrael’s concern, Senator Vas Shrivastava asked Hanrahan, “Could you imagine a scenario where you are trying to form a board for next semester, and there is a student who has been writing and is qualified, but has a different editorial philosophy? I want those people to feel like they have a chance at being chosen.”

Hanrahan responded that the board would be open to appointing such a student. He added that there are so few students interested in putting in the time, that the board cannot afford to exclude people.

**Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy**

This Friday senate will vote on changes to the Discriminatory Harassment and Sexual Misconduct Policy. While the senate hoped to gain more student body input before voting, instead they resolved to include a sunset clause, which is a provision that would require the policy to be revisited.

Vice President and Dean of Student Services Mike Brody said, “I want to hear more about the plan for the sunset,” to which Student Body President Ari Galper responded, “It can be whatever we want it to be.”

Director of Community Safety Gary Granger argued that without a policy in place, it is harder for CSOs to train new officers. He went on to argue: “If a lawsuit happens, what will matter is what is written down, not what we have been doing anyway,” Director of Community Safety Gary Granger says. “Lawyers would say that our greatest liability right now is to have a clear policy so that students know what the expectations are.”

Brody noted that “the summer gives us a unique opportunity to do training for faculty and for incoming students.” If the policy is not passed this Friday, he says, “it’s not a semester, it’s a year” that would be missed, as summer is the only extended period of time where students are not on campus.

But Messick expressed concern about voting with such short notice. “I think the Senate and the faculty both have been put in an uncomfortable position. We’ve been dipped in red ink and expected to make a decision on this.”

**_New York Times_ on Campus**

Since _The New York Times_ on Campus is consistently voted into the Top 20, Senate voted to make it a line item on the budget.
