Reed has opened a Title IX investigation into alleged inequitable treatment of women’s facilities and sports teams by the Sports Center. Some members of the Women’s Rugby team have claimed that men’s sports teams are given preferential treatment by the Sports Center.

The team was recently dealt a blow when their coach, Valerie Burns, resigned, citing a lack of “fitness and numbers” as the reason for her resignation. At Burns’ recommendation, Dean of Student Services Mike Brody withdrew the administration’s financial support for the Women’s Rugby team’s competition in league play, forcing the Women’s Rugby team to look to Student Body Funds to pay travel and tournament entry costs. Brody said that Reed doesn’t have a written definition of what constitutes a sports team, what would bar a group from being a team, or what behavior might merit pulling funding from a team, so the rugby team’s status is unclear. “It seems problematic to send any team without a coach, but at the same time I don’t think it’s against the rules,” said Brody, “because we have not to date defined the rules in writing, and we intend to do so.” Brody confirmed that Reed will continue to pay for food, coaching and travel to games outside of league play but said that administration will not support league play until a new coach decides the team is ready. According to Brody, “As soon as that coach tells me that you’re ready to go, you’re ready to go.”

Title IX states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” Ed McFarlane, a Vice President and Treasurer of the college who is responsible for conducting Title IX investigations, was unable to give details concerning the current investigation but provided general details regarding a Title IX investigation at Reed. McFarlane emphasized the thoroughness and timeliness with which the administration will be approaching the investigation, but said in an email that “depending upon the nature of the allegation(s), information about the sanctions assessed (if any) may not be provided because of privacy rights.”

Questions have been raised regarding the circumstances surrounding Burns’ resignation. The Women’s Rugby team fell under the scrutiny of the administration following an incident in late January where the team brought beer to the ski cabin. According to team captain Nora McConnell-Johnson ’12, Burns, who was present at the ski cabin, was uncomfortable with the drinking. The team began a discussion with Burns that she saw as “argumentative.” The discussion devolved into a conversation about the balance of power between the players and their coach, while Burns maintained that she was the “last word.” McConnell-Johnson rejects that Burns has a say on the team’s affairs off the field but emphasized that, “on pitch we would do what she said.” The beer at the ski cabin led to what was characterized by Burns in an email to the team as an “administrative nightmare” that “caused a situation in which you needed to be punished.”

Burns was asked to resign on January 26<sup>th</sup> by Michael Lombardo, Director of Physical Education and Athletics. After the ski cabin incident, following Lombardo’s request for Burns resignation, she said in an email to the team, “so the rugby team could be cancelled until this coming fall of 2012.” Burns alleges that after submitting her resignation letter Lombardo “requested specific edits be made to my letter to give himself something in writing to go to Mike Brody to get the program cancelled until the Fall.” Burns complied with Lombardo’s request and informed the team, to their surprise, of her resignation, again citing fitness and numbers as her reason for resigning. Burns added, “sometimes there were as many coaches as players. It wears you thin after a while.” McConnell-Johnson challenges Burns’ assertion that the team was lacking fitness: “We’re not going to win the regional championship, but we are safe competitors. There will be injuries but no more so than any other team.” McConnell-Johnson also noted that past Women’s Rugby teams at Reed have produced 5 All-Americans and two Eagles (US National Team players) and was the only sports team at Reed to have done so.

Three members of the rugby team, McConnell-Johnson, Elizabeth Mastrangelo ‘13, and Allison Theriault ‘14 met with Brody on January 31 to discuss the future of the team following Burns’ resignation. At the meeting McConnell-Johnson presented Brody with a list of grievances against the Sports Center alleging inequitable treatment of women’s sports teams. Following the discussion, Brody sent an email informing the rugby team that “Reed cannot formally support or sanction team travel or league play at this time” a statement that was interpreted by McConnell-Johnson to mean that Women’s Rugby at Reed had been cancelled. Brody also suggested formal mediation through the Honor Council between Michael Lombardo and the three members of rugby team present at the meeting, though the Honor Council does not facilitate group mediation.

McConnell-Johnson posted on her Facebook “Did you all know that the Women’s Rugby program at Reed was just CANCELLED?!? Send all complaints and inquiries to &#x62;&#x72;&#x6f;&#x64;&#x79;&#x6d;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;.” This resulted in an outpouring of both support and outrage from rugby alumni, many of whom sent emails to Brody. One passionate rugby alum made a post in an alumni Facebook group telling other alumni to “Go shit on Lombardo and that other tool Brody.” Brody confirmed that although some of the emails were “threatening” it was made apparent to him “that Rugby means a great deal to Reed.”

The rugby team sent President Colin Diver a letter in which they claimed the team had “experienced discrimination” and “denied funding for new jerseys though the men’s team was provided new jerseys despite having fewer players than our team.” The letter continued, “the men have been given funds to travel to a tournament in Las Vegas this February,” despite the fact that they had so few players last season that they dropped out of their league, and they are still recovering.” Brody invited McConnell-Johnson, Mastrangelo, and Theriault for a second meeting in which he reaffirmed his support for the Women’s Rugby program and clarified his stance regarding the conditions under which Women’s Rugby might reenter league play.

Lombardo declined to comment, saying he had been told by McFarlane not to discuss events surrounding Women’s Rugby. Lombardo said that he regretted being unable to be interviewed, and added, “All that I can adamantly declare (it appears) is that I have always acted equitably and in the best interest of all Reed students, and that I am profoundly distressed that the reputation of a department that has worked so tirelessly to provide health and wellness programming to our students is being unjustifiably tarnished.”
