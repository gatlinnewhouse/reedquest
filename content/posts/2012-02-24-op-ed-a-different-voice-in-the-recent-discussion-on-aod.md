The arrests of two students and the Administration’s involvement in those arrests has been, and will very likely continue to be, a hot topic on campus. I am voicing no opinion not already heard when I say that I feel horrible for the students who were arrested, and that it is incredibly important that we, as a community, withhold any proclamations about their character based on this single event. The many students who have voiced this opinion have every right to and should continue making their feelings heard. However, in the spirit of reasonableness, honesty, and the honor principle, I want to present my own opinion, an opinion that has not been as of yet as vocal.

With the knowledge that I have about this event (which I admit is limited), I believe the actions taken by the Administration, Gary Granger, and Mike Brody were justified. I believe this because I think it’s dangerous for our campus—for the individual students on this campus and for our community—when a single party is holding such large quantities of any drug. To be clear, I think that even with a drug as innocuous as weed, the potential for dangerous and ill-intended outsiders and drug dealers to come onto our campus goes considerably up when a single party holds such large quantities, and has the potential for setting a precedence that such large holdings are OK. I do not think the students themselves are or ever were dangerous to the community, but the choice they made was. Furthermore, I believe the Administration, Gary, and Mike have every right to uphold the laws that are written and they are bound to, and I do not think they are in violation of the honor principle by doing thus.

I voice these opinions out of respect for the Reed community I live in and the values that I believe we hold. I believe these values uphold the fact that the only fair and honorable way to understand any contentious event is to hear the opinions from all sides, and respectfully take part in a discussion with others who hold differing views, if we see fit. These values additionally include pursuing a discussion with an intention for understanding rather than justice in mind, and with a hope at moving forward together, rather than as fractions apart. I think we are currently living through an event that could set a precedent for all future contentious issues at Reed, and thus I think it is especially important that we uphold our values right now to their fullest bloom.

I also voice these opinions so that others have the opportunity to confront me with their disagreements on them. I will happily take part in any discussion with any party on this matter. I will say with total honesty that I know well and respect many of the people who hold a different opinion than I do, and would only feel as if I were upholding my side of the friendly and honest relationship I hold with them if I were to be honest. I only request that any discussions focus less on the contents of my knowledge, and more on the disagreement we hold and the ways we can move forward together, disagreements and all.

I write this out of respect for all the students, faculty and staff at Reed College. I can only hope that this encourages further reasoned, honest, and honorable discussion in the future.
