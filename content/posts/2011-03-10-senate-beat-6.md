Senate began with a fuller house than usual alongside some wonderful decorations courtesy of RAW. Speaking of the aforementioned decorations, the Circus Man (who has a name, we are sure) was the first unexpected visitor of the meeting. He wanted to know if he could leave up his ultra rad tent thingy in the SU. The next unexpected visitor of the meeting, Kent Coupe, came in asking for something even more radical: support for sending a troop of armed Reedies to Libya over spring break. Think of it as an RSSK field trip, but slightly more hands-on and with a higher risk of death, if you will. Senate approved supporting the troop of Reedie Rebels, pending a funding decision by Finance Committee. A $15 co-pay was suggested to fund the trip. The final unexpected visitor was Daire MacFadden, representing the Judicial Board. J-Board wants to take over the Senate office. Senate said they would think about this and discuss it further at the next meeting. Just like that, Senate? Ya’ll aren’t gonna fight for your territory? Shame.

Onto committee reports!

Meg had her final meeting with Dax King, and got to meet the New Dax (aka Vanessa), who apparently has her nose and lip pierced. Hawt!

Todd appointed himself Scrounge Liaison.

Appointments Committee got us some Nitrogen Day Czars (I can haz liquid nitrogen ice cream?) and members for the newly formed Diversity Committee (aww yeah!). You should apply to be Wage Review TaskForceBoardCommitteeCzars, Election Czars, and Griffin (yearbook!) Editor.

Also, CSOs are sad that you don’t want to play pool with them anymore.

Dazriel has an office hour at the Scrounge post senate meetings. Go buy him some strips and fries and talk politics.

Finance Committee made more cuts than a barber shop this week. Man Club was given zero dollars for steak and strippers. Almost as big of a let down as wings getting zero funded during Funding Circus. Almost.

The executive team decreed that contrary to popular belief, no one has been evicted from the dorms for AOD violations. What did we learn about rumors in middle school? “Rumors, rumors are no fun/ rumors suck for everyone&#8230;” or something like that.

Honor Council will be hosting the upcoming Reed Union on April 4 in Kaul. The discussion panel will include Brody, Kambiz, Tamara, Dana the RD, C. Divvy, some Honor Council kids, and the return of Honor All-Star Peter Jantzen.

The bylaws for Diversity Committee were (re)passed. No one was able to find out when the bylaws were passed last semester, so they just did again to be extra sure.

The main part of the meeting, and the reason for the higher-than-usual attendance was the discussion about smoking. Faculty member David Perkinson brought his concerns about smoking in the library and bio breezeway to Senate. People were in general agreement that smokers should have the right to smoke, but non-smokers should also have the right to breathe clean air. As Big Money put it: smoking is a choice, breathing isn’t.

What seems like the most viable solution is to build a structure, the sole function of which will be to serve as a place where smokers can puff away without blackening the lungs of their non-smoking counterparts. However, there are a few problems with this solution. First, Colin isn’t interested in funding something like this because it would make it appear as though he and the rest of the administration support smoking, which they don’t. Olde Senate found this out a few years ago when this very same solution to this issue was proposed (Project Gazebo ‘08, anyone?). So if something like this is going to be constructed, it’s going to have to be a student-led, student-funded initiative.

However! There is still another issue with this! Non-permanent structures—what this solution would be—can only be up for a few weeks before they must be taken down, unless Senate can manage to secure special permission to make an exception. Senator Schwartz has secured $45 in funding for TARP (Temporary Asshole Relocation Program) to put a, uh, tarp over the bike racks by the fundome. They’ll see how effective this is as a solution and then move from there.
  
Senate \*might\* put out a survey to better understand the student body’s position on the issue.

Honor Council also has a survey out right now that could also help Senate figure out what to do. The only problem with student body surveys is that they completely ignore the fact that students are not the only members of this community.

In short, there is still a lot of discussion that needs to take place to find a viable solution for all, and Senate has stated their commitment to continuing this conversation at future meetings. If you have any thoughts on a solution to this problem, we’re sure Senate would love to hear what you have to say: [&#x73;&#x65;&#x6e;&#x61;&#x74;&#x65;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x6c;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x73;&#x2e;&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1]. Go for it!

Under new business, Gary Granger came to announce that starting next semester, the email portion of the Emergency Notification System will be opt-out. The text message portion of the system will still be opt-in. Currently, the system is opt-in, so if you’re interested in getting these notifications, sign up!
