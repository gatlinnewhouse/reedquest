Beginning on Tuesday, October 25th, petitions will be available for candidates wishing to run in the upcoming election. Open terms beginning in the spring semester include President, Vice President, four year-long Senate seats, and Quest Board. Students may run for multiple positions, but may only hold one. Petitions can also be used to submit recalls, referenda, initiatives, or pollsâ€”please consult the bylaws for further information.

If you would like to be a candidate for one of the aforementioned positions, you must take the following steps: 1) Get a petition and gain the appropriate number of signatures required for the position in which you are running. Petitions can be found in the GCCs, the library lobby, and the Paradox. 2) Turn in your completed petition to mail box 475 or box 922 no later than 5 pm on November 9th. 3) Await email confirmation that your candidacy has been accepted. Further instructions will also be included at this time. Please note that you must be in good academic standing in order to be qualified to run.

Students, especially those wishing to run, are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Community Documents, which can be found online at sin.reed.edu. Keep an eye out for more information regarding Elections Assembly and voting!
