Suppose you want to Get Something Done. Suppose your car is stranded three hundred miles away (just outside of Medford) with a thrown rod and a twisted crank and you have to get it up to Portland. You have what boils down to two choices: The Way or The Bunch of Friends. The Way is to have it long-distance towed and let someone else deal with the hassle. [&#8230;] The Bunch of Friends method means borrowing Mark&#8217;s Sister-In-Law&#8217;s Beat Up Pickup Truck, getting together the requisite Friends, executing a nightmare speed run at 3 am and hauling the damned thing up. It&#8217;s gonna end up costing the same as a tow truck, but if you can get the Friends and the Truck together you can just do it and it&#8217;ll be done. [&#8230;]

At Reed, we worship The Way. We have all the Committees and Boards and Petitions and Senates and Caucuses and Reed Unions you could ever want, and as soon as you try to Get Something Done you&#8217;ll be gridlocked into the biggest administrative logjam this side of Immigration and Naturalization. I ran for President as the Champion of The Way. The night I was elected, they led me to a small dark room containing a great big old rusty machine bristling with levers, gauges, FM antennae, Tesla coils, spark-gap apparata, Buddhist prayer wheels, and the transmission from a &#8217;57 Dodge Dart. It seemed on closer examination that generations of engineers had worked on the contraption at various times, but without any regard to the work of those who had gone before, or the security of those to come. This structure, I was informed, was the Way to Get Things Done at Reed, and I was required by ritual law to use it.

That is to say: In 1961, Reed embarked on an experiment with Community Government. A clear and coherent Community Constitution and Bylaws were written up, haggled about endlessly, and adopted. Time passed. Reed changed. The world changed. Most of us were born. Changes were made periodically in the structure of government, but only in response to the current crisis, and never with an eye to consistency. Reed&#8217;s biggest recent crisis (over a Black Studies Program) fell in the year Community Government was supposed to be reviewed, and this review has never occurred. [&#8230;]

The Way at Reed exhibits all the worst characteristics of The Way everywhere: it&#8217;s unwieldy, time-consuming, bureaucratic, and a pain in the ass. It virtually drives people into the arms of the Bunch of Friends. In 1984, the Student Issues Board (SIB to the hip; essentially a Bunch of Friends) put out a detailed report on Student Services at Reed because they wanted something done and couldn&#8217;t find a Way to do it. [Actually, they got the SB President to appoint them as an &#8220;official&#8221; committee — see &#8220;volunteering&#8221; at the end of &#8220;Getting Things Done&#8221; in this article.] Last November, 17 people occupied the President&#8217;s office (the Real President&#8217;s office, not mine) to urge the Way to action on divestment. Last January, over one hundred people (not all of them friends) took over Eliot Hall for three days because of their outrage at the Way&#8217;s response for campus-wide calls for divestment.

[More recently, in March, 1987,11 students occupied the Development Office and demanded that the Trustees vote for full divestment.]

A Bunch of Friends can undoubtedly Get Something Done. The three Bunches cited above have furthered, at a cost, the cause of student -participation in the existence of Reed College. But we can&#8217;t keep doing things this way. It&#8217;s inefficient, it&#8217;s risky, and it&#8217;s hard to control what you get. What if you can&#8217;t find the Bunch? What if the Sister-in-Law&#8217;s Truck breaks down, too? What if, by the time you get it together on a day when no one has to work, the guy&#8217;s sold your car for parts? You&#8217;re fucked, that&#8217;s what. At Reed, the alternative to The Way is to try to work directly with the Administration, but the very existence of The Way paralyzes access to this route. [&#8230;]

So what&#8217;s the point? Civil disobedience is a fine thing in its place, but it&#8217;s no way to run a college. We need to get together on a Way that works. Listen to the people who talk about revising the Constitution and the By-Laws. Trial&#8217;s where the real Things are going to Get Done. This is not an easy thing to do. I&#8217;m asking you to have faith in The System, or at least in the idea of a workable system, built by Reedies. I know that&#8217;s not why you came here, but shit. It&#8217;s that or take over a building every time we want Something Done [and that usually doesn&#8217;t work either}.
