On Tuesday night, Shira Tarrant, a nationally distinguished expert on gender and sexual politics, spoke to a crowd of students and individuals from outside Reed in Vollum Lounge. The title of the discussion was &#8220;Politics and Pleasure: Men, Feminism, and Social Change,&#8221; though part of her lecture was devoted to giving suggestions on ways one can take an active role in stopping or prohibiting sexual assault and violence; the latter of which has become a controversial issue among students this past semester.

Dr. Tarrant has spoken about these issues on campuses across the country. Soudea Forbes, a sophomore anthropology major, organized Tuesday evening’s event. Forbes said she was happy with the success of the event, namely, the equal distribution of men and women in the audience. According to Forbes, most of the social justice events on campus distinctly lack a white male presence.

Prior to the discussion portion of her talk, Dr. Tarrant focused on articulating how gender-based violence and advocacy against such violence can and should be taken up by men and women alike. She stressed that actually participating in the activism, whether publicly or in the context of one’s own life, is the only way to create positive change. Her recommendations for ‘micro-activism’ ranged from “doing it with the lights on or when you aren’t drunk” to speaking up and interrupting peers who perpetuate gender injustice, to simply recognizing the privilege that comes with being a man.

After the lecture, Tarrant answered questions concerning consent and a college’s role in dealing with sexual assault issues. Questions concerning impaired consent and ensuring consensual sex were among a number addressed by Dr. Tarrant. Her position on these issues was expressed in no uncertain terms: whenever one is in any sort of impaired state, he or she is unable to consent or accurately recognize when consent is given. She stated that taking part in sexual activity under the influence is dangerous in that it could possibly lead to sexual assault. To this point, Tarrant cited a study that found that men who participated in activities indicative of sexual assault did not consider themselves to be taking part in rape. Furthermore, she pointed out that women who state activities indicative of being victims of sexual assault did not consider themselves to have been assaulted.

This dialogue quickly segued into the issue of Reed’s Judicial Board, and the role that college administration and students should have in dealing with sexual assault. An individual asked Dr. Tarrant whether she thought Reed students should be “leading trials” concerning sexual assault for their peers. Dr. Tarrant responded flatly that she believes that outside forces—those who have significant training to deal with such incidents—should be the ones dealing with sexual assault cases on campus. Tarrant also mentioned that because sexual assault is a legal issue it should be dealt with by the police, as opposed to being kept within the boundaries of the school.

Katy Joseph, a senior and anthropology major, was particularly happy with the candidness of her discussion about sexual assault. “It was refreshing to have a substantive conversation in which the damage to an assailant’s reputation was tempered by the stark facts regarding false reporting, the status of their actions as a criminal offense, and the long term physical and psychological impact on their victim,” Joseph said.

The Multicultural Resource Center hopes to continue bringing in speakers who promote conversation and discourse that is relevant to the Reed community. Tarrant is currently working on her fourth book about gender and sexual politics, entitled _Fashion Talks: Undressing the Power of Style_. It is due out in 2012.
