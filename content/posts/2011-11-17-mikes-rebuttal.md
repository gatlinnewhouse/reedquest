_Rebuttal to Jacob Canter&#8217;s &#8220;Response to &#8220;Ask Mike&#8221;&#8221;  _

Thanks so much for sharing this with me this, Jacob. I actually think we are entirely in agreement here. I don&#8217;t blame the student body at large, nor do I mean in any way to suggest that the Senate is free of responsibility. To the contrary, as you say, you elect the Senate to represent you, and as such they have a huge obligation to do so thoughtfully, diligently, and honorably.  It seems reasonable to argue that this process of representation entails, among other things, keeping students informed and engaged. For your part, and that of your student colleagues, there must be a willingness to engage, busy-ness notwithstanding. The nice thing about Reed is pretty much everybody gets how intense it is, so you won&#8217;t hear me or anyone else who has been around for a while claiming that you&#8217;re just sitting around killing time. That&#8217;s why it means so much to me that you took the time to write this. Like you say, we like how demanding it is, and we have to live with the inherent limitations these demands impose. The question, I think, is how do we live within those limitations without abdicating our responsibilities to the community—students, Senate, staff, faculty—all of us? That&#8217;s the challenge, and I think we&#8217;re up to it, as long as we&#8217;re in it together.
