Dear Reed Community,

In a couple of weeks, you’ll receive an invitation to participate in the Reed College Campus Climate Survey. You’ll see flyers posted around campus and you’ll hear your professors, colleagues, and friends talking about the survey. And, we hope, you will be among those who are actively encouraging your friends, peers, and colleagues to participate.

Reed College aspires to be an inclusive community that respects and honors all of its members. Only by assessing where we are can we fully understand what is working well and what areas need attention and action. So we’re asking for your help. Please participate. It is incredibly important to us that as many members—from all backgrounds—take the survey.

The anonymous and comprehensive institution-wide campus climate survey is meant to help us assess how students, staff, and faculty experience Reed as a living, learning, and working community. Anonymity is particularly important because we want community members to feel free and able to be honest in their assessments and responses.

And because it’s our goal that this be a transparent process, the results of the data we collect will be presented in a public forum with the community in the spring. From those data, the Campus Climate Working Group will develop and render a series of short-term, intermediate, and long-term recommendations to the appropriate committees and people. Those recommendations, too, will be shared with the community.

You can learn more about the Campus Climate Survey, the Campus Climate Working Group, our timeline, and the consultant with whom we’ve been working by visiting our [website][1].

The survey will go “live” on Oct. 24 and will be up for 2 weeks. Meanwhile, while the survey is up, members of the Campus Climate Working Group will be tabling in Commons during lunch. So if you have other questions, please don’t hesitate to stop by and chat with us.

As a special thank you for participating, survey participants will be eligible for a free 12-oz. coffee or tea from the Paradox and to enter a random drawing for six Reed community members (plus one guest) to dine with President Kroger at the Parker House in spring 2013.

Again, thanks for your help. We really appreciate it.
