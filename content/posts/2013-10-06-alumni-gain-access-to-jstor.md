Olde Reed may be dead, but now they can access JSTOR from their shallow grave. Last month, Reed expanded JSTOR access to alumni, giving them the same JSTOR usage available to current Reedies. On the first day of this change alone, 200 alumni called in to Parent and Alumni Services frantically asking for help with accessing their IRIS account, and therefore JSTOR.

Previously, alumni could only get college library cards that allowed them to use all of the library’s physical texts, but only some of the online resources available to current students. This system was of little help to the many Reed alumni outside of Portland, says Library Director Dena Hutto.

The expansion was made possible last January when JSTOR decided to broaden its sales of alumni access from a select group of colleges to include all colleges. JSTOR is the only database used by Reed that is offering subscription access for alumni, says Mike Teskey, Director of Alumni and Parent Relations. According to Hutto, the contracts with database companies are also why alumni can only access certain online resources even in the library.

The move was in line with JSTOR’s new effort to sell to a broader audience: JSTOR now also offers membership to unaffiliated individuals willing to pay each month and has made early content free to the general public. “This is one of the first expansions they’ve done outside of libraries,” noted Hutto.

Although JSTOR’s policy changed in January, it took several months for Reed to decide to whether to provide alumni access. “We felt that library funds were for current students, but [we] were asked about JSTOR all the time by alumni,” says Hutto. The discussion was resolved when Teskey volunteered to pay for alumni’s access to JSTOR. Since then the alumni office has been re-registering many alumni with Kerberos accounts so that they may gain access to JSTOR.

JSTOR has already become very popular among alumni, says Teskey: the announcement received a huge number of hits and shares on social media and the alumni office has since received an unusually large number of requests, over two hundred on the first day alone, for help with IRIS authentication. Teskey hopes that the program will keep alumni intellectually connected and engaged with Reed, noting that “the love of research does not disappear when Reedies graduate.”
