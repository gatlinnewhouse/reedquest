The committee on triggering events met for the first time today, March 8, to discuss guidelines for student groups to follow before putting on events. According to Senator Nina Liss-Schultz, the goal of the committee is to provide students with information about the content of an event before it happens; rather than to censor content. The committee has not decided if they are going to write entirely new guidelines for sexually explicit content, or if they are going to simply add guidelines to the existing ones.

“One of the larger ideas that came out was personal responsibility in recognizing whether or not you have a trigger in your event or not,” Senator Ben Goggin says. The committee was formed in response to a Comedy Club event last semester that contained triggering content.

The library is working on switching its current interface, the effects of which will be seen by next year. Reed’s library will be working with a consortium of colleges to get an integrated library system.

The creation of the new student sustainability coordinator position will be announced at the Reed Union on climate change next Wednesday. Applications for the position will be available next Thursday or Friday and due the Wednesday after spring break.

The Student Union committee met and decided to purchase a laser dance floor. The committee is considering replacing the floors in the Student Union, which were last replaced in the early 2000s. They are also working on obtaining a new piano from Prexy, and purchase new filing cabinets for the Paradox. Senator John Iselin announced that SIN has a new landing page, which is step one of a process to bolster the website.

The Strategic Planning Committee will meet for the first time next week to discuss an inclusive array of issues, which are relevant to the next several years. The purpose of the committee is to determine the allocation of funds from the college&#8217;s next capital campaign and make long-term decisions about the future of Reed. The committee consists of President John Kroger, Student Body President Ari Galper, and faculty from every department.

This Tuesday, the ad hoc committee on Paideia will convene for the first time with the purpose of amassing concrete suggestions as to what Paideia might look like in the future, especially with regard to the levels of involvement of faculty, administration, and students.

Senator Mat Olson said he was disappointed that no faculty members taught at Paideia this year, citing the historic class on how to speak Elvish as an example of positive faculty involvement. Liss-Schultz argued that faculty involvement might prohibit the inclusion of classes on drug-related material. “I’d like the community to focus on Paideia as an autonomous student driven thing,” she says.

Student Body Vice President Paul Messick says, “I don’t think that one person s concern over the legality of a class should influence Paideia. It should be a community thing.”

Senate also discussed general student involvement in as well as apathy towards Paideia. Senator Annam Swanson says, “If there was a campus wide event, something that everyone could come to, like a ribbon cutting or a barbeque …that might generate more attendance.”
