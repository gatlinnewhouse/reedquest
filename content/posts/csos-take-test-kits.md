During Paideia, Community Safety opened up the Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) locker in the Gray Campus Center (GCC) and removed all the drug test kits and supplements present there. The materials have now been returned to SSDP and should be replaced within the locker by the end of the week.

According to Gary Granger, head of Community Safety, a CSO saw a Reed alum opening the locker to reveal what appeared to be pills inside, which “led them \[to believe\] that there were some illicit substances in that locker.” Because the alum’s actions aroused the CSO’s suspicions, Community Safety used a field drug test kit to test a supplement that fell on the ground, which “tested presumptively positive for amphetamines.” 

Based on both the results of the test and the original “suspicious” behavior of the alum at the locker, Granger “approved going into the locker.” Community Safety cut the lock and removed the contents, which included harm-reduction supplements in pill form and substance testing kits. Several types of the confiscated supplements were tested using the Marquis field test kit by the CSOs. This kit works by turning specific colors in the presence of certain chemicals. In the case of the supplement in question (quercetin with bromelain), the color was the same as it would be in the presence of amphetamines, according to Brooke Elliott, head of SSDP.

“We use a set of eight test kits because a lot of things change the exact same color when you test them with just one test kit,” Elliott said. They expressed concern that the CSOs only used a Marquis test kit as, without other verification, it can give this type of false positive. This could have serious consequences for Reed students. Further consequences of the test kit confiscation include the removal of fentanyl test kits from the locker. Fentanyl has been a serious concern in Portland as of late, as two people died in Southeast Portland last year from Xanax laced with fentanyl, meaning that it is even more vital that students at Reed know what is in the substances they are ingesting. 

According to Elliott, Community Safety did not immediately contact SSDP after the test kit confiscation and it took the organization some time to learn of it. Granger held the test kits for approximately a week during Paideia, which is a popular time for drug use at Reed. During this time, several students contacted Elliott and asked to use their personal set of test kits as the SSDP one was missing. However, while these students were able to test substances to some capacity, Elliott did not have an additional fentanyl test kit. 

Community Safety has now returned the test kits and supplements to SSDP and is buying them a new lock. Contact Brooke Elliott (broelliot@reed.edu) or SSDP (reed.ssdp.testing.kit@gmail.com) with any questions about harm reduction supplies at Reed.
