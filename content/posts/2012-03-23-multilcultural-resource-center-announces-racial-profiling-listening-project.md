_By Andrew Barney and Sita Goetschius, MRC Interns_

After the recent student arrests, a question was posed at the following Senate meeting about racial profiling by Community Safety. To continue the discussion, the Multicultural Resource Center hosted a Tuesday Talk on Racial Profiling at Reed and Beyond attended by students, staff, and administrators. We found that several students had had distressing Community Safety interactions that the students perceived as racially motivated. Perhaps even more concerning was the perception among some students of color that Community Safety and administrators would not be responsive to their concerns.

We do not think that these anecdotes suffice to condemn Community Safety or school policy. However, as student interns in the Multicultural Resource Center, we certainly believe that these serious concerns warrant further investigation. To that end, over the next two weeks the MRC will be conducting a listening project on racial profiling at Reed.

> If you or someone you know has had an encounter with Community Safety perceived as racial profiling, we strongly encourage you to share your story with us.

We are currently soliciting interviews from any students, faculty, and staff of color who have had interactions with CSOs that they feel may have involved an element of racial profiling. You can schedule an interview with an intern, or contact us to get the interview questions and then record the interview with a trusted friend and send it to us. All information will be kept confidential unless specifically agreed to by the interviewee. By the end of the semester, the MRC will prepare a report on our findings and release them to the Reed community. If appropriate, this report will include suggestions for substantive policy changes that the MRC will work to see implemented.

To students, staff, and faculty: If you or someone you know has had an encounter with Community Safety perceived as racial profiling, we strongly encourage you to share your story with us. We are happy to answer any questions you have, and commit to putting our energy and resources towards whichever course of action seems most appropriate at the end of this process. To campus groups and interested community members: We need your support. Finally, to those who are skeptical of this project: We will strive for transparency both in our methodology and in the final report that will be released to every member of this community.

Presupposing bias or misconduct would strain our integrity as students as well as student interns. Likewise, we feel that scorning investigation into potential institutional biases against already marginalized groups strains the honor of this community. This project is a result of concerns expressed to us by members of the Reed community, and we feel that it is our responsibility to address those concerns with this investigation to create a better community at Reed.
