It is quarter to 5pm on 4/20, and Gary Granger sits in his office with a dazed look on his face. His eyes are red, and his overall demeanor is sleepier than usual.

One might conclude from such a spectacle that Granger was participating in the “festivities” of 4/20, the nationwide celebration of all things ganja. And he was—sort of. At 4:20am and pm, Granger and other students had congregated in the SU to enjoy a couple of fat blunts. However, the blunts in question were not actually filled with any of the green stuff. Instead, they were covered with a maple glaze and red sprinkles.

On Wednesday, Granger hosted “Eat a Blunt with Gary Granger,” a series of meet-and-greets in which he spoke to students and gave out free Voodoo Doughnuts. Among these donuts was the “Maple Blazer Blunt,” which the Voodoo Doughnuts website describes as “a raised doughnut rolled into a blunt with maple frosting and red sprinkle ember.” In total, over five hundred donuts were served to more than three hundred students.

“We wanted to do something for 4/20,” Granger said. “It’s nationally celebrated. It would be silly not to acknowledge it.”

Granger described the purpose of the event to be both a lighthearted spoof of recent criticism and a way to continue establishing a dialogue about community safety’s new method of implementing the college’s Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD) policy. Over the past year, community safety’s new rigor in enforcing Reed’s AOD policy has led to backlash by some students in the Reed community. “Smoke a Blunt with Gary Granger” was the first in a series of anonymous posters critiquing Granger and was the inspiration behind the event.

“We didn’t want to have CSOs running around and catching people [for smoking on 4/20],” Granger said. “While marijuana is illegal, I didn’t see my job [on 4/20] as doing a million dorm checks.” Granger also noted that community safety’s patrols and strategy for enforcing AOD did not change on Wednesday.

Granger said that the event helped create openness between students because it was lighthearted and honest. “We have to do our job, but we also want to show the student body that we don’t take ourselves that seriously,” Granger said.

Granger believes that such candidness has led to a strengthening of the dialogue he has been trying to build for the past year. “I was able to talk to so many students, and even shake hands with some students that I’ve had AOD encounters with.” Perhaps to this point, Granger also acknowledged that fact that he was often giving donuts to students who were “obviously feeling the munchies.”
