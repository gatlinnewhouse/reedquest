Let us preface this by saying that by the time you, dear Quest reader, read these accounts of Senate meeting they will actually be two senate meetings old. The time between the Quest deadline, senate meeting (Tuesdays 5pm in the SU!), and when the Quest actually comes out does not work in our favor.

Senate started with a super-secret-senate-huddle, which ended in a “Go Senate!” cheer, which is how I’m assuming is how all executive sessions end.

A lot of committees still haven’t met, or have only had “logistical meetings” so there wasn’t too much news on that front. Some of the few highlights include:

ResLife is starting their search for a new head, Kathy Rose is leaving at the end of the semester, and there was a position title change for the Multicultural Affairs administrator Bruce Smith.

Celia and Austin met with Colin and talked mostly about the old scapegoat The Quest (online).  Apparently there is nothing that can be done to censor the Quest (good), however senate can pull funding (which would be dumb). The only legal issue C-Divvy foresaw with the Quest online was if the website used the Official Seal of Reed College. Go figure.

At this point Celia and Austin were brought food from Commons, including what appeared to be a bowl full of condiments. Remember, ketchup is not a vegetable!

Austin went over finance committee allocations. Apparently Reed now has a sillyband society. Finance Committee has imposed a new rule for asking for funds for speakers or bands. If you don’t ask at least 10 days prior to the event, you get no funding. Mostly finance committee was tired of feeling “forced” into funding.

Geez, you don’t have to make it sound so nonconsensual.

Nina went to the faculty meeting last week, and the faculty is worried about what’s going to happen with the Greywood building renovation. The new Greywood building is going to have more classroom spaces, the language lab, and some other stuff (I think someone said the admissions office too). Some faculty members are afraid that this renovation will take time away from building the new performing arts center, which according to some people is more important than the Greywood renovation.

Neither of these buildings have anything to do with Physics, coffee, or getting crunk so Alexa and I don’t really care.

Todd met with CUS and Reed has been getting a lot of piracy complaints, so Senate kindly reminded us to not steal music. Celia added that we should not steal people’s girlfriends either. Stealing music is sooooo 2001, anyway.

There was also a lot of concern about the CSOs new way of actually enforcing the AOD policy. Their new motto is “Don’t do nothing,” an excellent change from their previous motto, “Don’t do shit.” Gary (our new CSO director) has a huge map of all the places on campus AOD violations have occurred (guess how many KRRC has!!) All of this sounds sort of big-brother to me. The moral of this story is: Discretion. Always. The CSOs have also expressed concern over upperclassmen giving freshlings beer, so we may be hanging up our beer fairy wings.

The next thing on the agenda was the results of the Quest survey. Most of the discussion was tabled since Quest liaison Todd hadn’t met with the Quest yet, but Zach debriefed us on the results (Celia later included them in SBinfo, check your inbox folks). Basically, the results showed that Senate’s freak out over the Quest being online was a little bit of an overreaction. Most students actually supported the Quest being on the interwebz, however they do think that most or all of the content should be Reed community only.

Senate then shifted to a “town-hall” style meeting where various concerns were brought up. Diversity committee… Dog policy… okay. LASER TAG IN THE LIBRARY?? HELL YEAH!!!! Corey “Laser Tag in the Library” Savaiano has assured us that Laser Tag in the Library will be back next semester.

AND NOW FOR THE DIALOGUE OF THE WEEK!
