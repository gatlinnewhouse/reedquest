_Blue Like Jazz,_ the film adaptation of the New York Times bestseller of the same name, will hold its second public premiere in Kaul auditorium on April 11 after premiering at the South by Southwest film festival on March 13. The book, Christian author Donald Miller&#8217;s semi-autobiographical recount of exploring his spirituality while auditing classes at Reed, was released in 2003 to an enthusiastic reception by Christian audiences, selling over 1.3 million copies. In the adaptation, Don, the 19-year-old protagonist transfers from junior college, and his conservative Southern Baptist church in Houston, to Reed.

The movie, replete with quintessential Reed settings like Hum conferences, the Bike Co-Op, and Renn Fayre, was filmed in part on campus last February. While Miller has conceded that the film has taken liberties with its portrayal of Reed&#8217;s campus and students (Renn Fayre was shown as a &#8220;sort of a frat party, Flaming Lips concert feel” event, said Miller, and one trailer includes a scene where two students have a conversation in the library) the cast and crew have repeated that they strove to remain true to Reed. “I would hope that Reed students would see the film and feel honored by it,” Miller said in a video on the movie’s website.

Seven years after the book&#8217;s release, Steve Taylor, a Christian artist with a background primarily in music, announced that he was working on a film adaptation of the text. However, in September 2010, only months after the adaptation was announced, Donald Miller wrote on his blog that the the movie, despite its cast of actors like Claire Holt from &#8220;The Vampire Diaries,&#8221; James Marsden from &#8220;MAD,&#8221; and Marshall Allman, from &#8220;True Blood,&#8221; was being put on hold indefinitely due to lack of funding. In response, two fans started a project on Kickstarter, a crowd-funding website, where they asked other fans help &#8220;Save Blue Like Jazz!&#8221; The project was a runaway success, with almost 4,500 backers contributing over $345,000–more than twice the initial $125,000 requested. The overwhelming support for the film secured even more funding for the project, and all delays were pushed aside as Taylor, astounded by the support, made use of the $1.25 million budget he had been granted.

The film has been picked up for distribution by Roadside Attractions and will be in theaters April 13th. The production team is also releasing videos every week–with the first one having been released on Wednesday– about the making of the movie. They can all be found on the about page on the movie&#8217;s website bluelikejazzthemovie.com. The last video will be released on Wednesday, April 11, the day of the special on-campus screening of the film in Kaul. The screening will be followed by a Q&A with Miller and Taylor.
