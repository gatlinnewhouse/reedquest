I’ve typed and pipetted so much in the last two weeks that I developed tennis elbow and wrist. I am not even joking. I thought that pipetting until your fingers break off belonged to the whimsical domain of PhD comics, but I’ve got a stylish brace that proves it could happen to you. (It’s more likely if you are running quantitative PCR, a highly technical process that involves filling 92 tiny little wells with tiny little volumes of several clear liquids, each of which has to be pipetted up and down many times to mix thoroughly, and then waiting an hour or two for results that make no sense. English majors, y’all are probably safe.)

I haven’t spoken to anyone who doesn’t live in my house or my thesis office for weeks. Even then, our conversations keep getting interrupted by timers. However, the amount of time I spend on the internet in work-avoidance mode has bizarrely ballooned. Ask me about classically-trained dancers in Telugu movies in the 1960s. Or about the etymology of the word “mansplainer” in the feminist blogosphere.  Just for the love of God don’t ask me what influences prohormone mRNA localization in bag cell clusters in the sea slug brain, because I have no idea.
