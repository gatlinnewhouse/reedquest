Reed’s Bike Co-op is almost always full of greasy-handed bike mechanics patching up tires and fixing handlebars for the student body. But on Monday nights from 5 to 7 p.m., the mechanics at the Co-op have a little more in common: They are all female, and they are all there for Ladies’ Night.

Marie Perez ’12 and Lauren Bergenholtz ’11 started Ladies’ Night two years ago in response to a male-dominated Bike Co-op. “I just felt like the Co-op was this place to hang out with the guys,” Perez said. She and Bergenholtz also noticed that the mechanics were generally unwilling to teach bike owners how to fix their own bikes. “Going to other people’s shifts, it seemed like the mechanics would just do things for other people,” she explained. Perez and Bergenholtz hoped to create an environment in which bike owners, especially females uncomfortable with an all-male atmosphere, could learn to fix their own bikes.

Charlie Renison ’12, another bike mechanic who works at Ladies’ Night, agreed that the weekly event meets a need for female mechanics. “The biking coalition is primarily associated with dudes,” she said. “But there are so many badass female mechanics.” As she reinstalled the handlebars on her bike, she added, “Ladies’ Night is less machismo, ‘let-me-do-this-for-you,’ hitting-on bullshit.”

Taylor Stinchcomb ’14 is also a bike mechanic who enjoys the female atmosphere. “It’s cool when guys come in and see it’s all us chicks in here,” she said. But Stinchcomb puts more stress on the learning environment that Ladies’ Night offers. As a shadow for Perez, she hopes to carry on Ladies’ Night after Perez and Renison graduate.

Perez attributes most of her knowledge about bikes to the Reed Bike Co-op. The knowledge she gained there allowed her to tour the Americas. “Most of what I learned about bikes I learned here. Then I took a couple of years off and went touring,” she said. “I went down to South America from here. Last spring I was riding around the American West—California, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Colorado.” Knowing the ins and outs of her bike, she said, helped her along the way.

Perez and the other ladies of the Co-op hope to bring this sort of knowledge to anyone who wants it. As Perez helped someone who dropped in with a broken bike, Renison taught me how to patch a tire while Stinchcomb looked on. Perez believes that this kind of learning environment pays off. “If [Reedies] are interested in getting into bikes, they just need to hang out at the Co-op on any shift, ask questions, and read books,” she said. “It’s really rewarding.”
