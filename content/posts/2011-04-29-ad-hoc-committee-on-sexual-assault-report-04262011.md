The Ad-hoc Committee on Sexual Assault has completed its charge of &#8220;reviewing and evaluating our current practices for both preventing sexual assault and responding to claims of sexual assault&#8221; and is pleased to forward its findings and recommendations. Included as appendices is information reflecting our research of practices at other colleges.

After having evaluated Reed&#8217;s sexual assault policy and procedures, as well as those of several peer institutions, we find that we need both to strengthen some of our current practices and to make some important changes. To that end, we suggest that the College consider the following recommendations so as to better serve the rights and safety of all members of the Reed community. We recognize that implementing these changes will require additional staffing and the dedication of significant financial resources, but we believe that this investment is essential to meeting the goals expressed in our charge, i.e. to &#8220;reduce the likelihood that any Reed student will be the victim of sexual assault, and to ensure that any student who is a victim of sexual assault receives the best possible support.&#8221; In the absence of more staffing and funding, the crucial measures suggested below simply cannot be put in place.

**General Recommendations**:
  
-Conduct a comprehensive review of current practices and determine whether Reed complies satisfactorily with Title IX, _Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act_(FERPA), and the Clery Act.
  
-Develop and distribute a policy on sexual assault that comports with applicable local and federal laws as well as with the rights and standards of the Reed community.
  
-Dedicate a full-time position to sexual assault prevention. This staff member would report to the VP/Dean of Student Services or designee and should have professional expertise in sexual assault prevention and in the provision of state-of-the-art educational initiatives, including bystander training and cultural change approaches. Expertise in the related areas of judicial processing and survivor support would also be required. This individual would devote time, energy, and focus to implementing new strategies for education and outreach and to overseeing all relevant programs and activities. Responsibilities would include organizing prevention/education efforts, engaging with survivors, providing training for policy-making bodies and judiciary boards, as well as, more generally, for staff, faculty, and campus housing advisers.

**Education and Outreach**:

Current Practice:
  
Education and outreach efforts are concentrated at the start of the year, most especially during Orientation Week. Additional activities take place during the academic year, but these vary from year to year, often at student initiative. In keeping with what are nationally recognized as best practices, the recommendations below provide the bases for far more robust and consistent offerings.

Recommended actions:
  
-Create a centralized hub to coordinate all programs having to do with education, outreach, and prevention. This hub should be in communication throughout the year with all college constituencies (i.e., staff, faculty, and students) and with all relevant affinity groups (e.g., LGBT groups, international students, male-identified groups, the Multicultural Resource Center, etc. )
  
&#8211; Bolster the Orientation Week event and add another campus-wide event each semester. During Orientation Week, create multiple training opportunities for students, including a centralized forum and break-out sessions. These should be coordinated with sessions on the honor principle to help students understand the connection between breaching the honor principle and sexual assault.
  
-Undertake year-long multi-faceted and comprehensive educational efforts that are coordinated in order to ensure adequate program variety and effective outreach. There should be ample advertising for these programs.
  
-Implement ongoing awareness campaigns.
  
-Implement mandatory sexual assault education for all students, carried out in tandem with alcohol and drug prevention programs.
  
-Implement mandatory sexual assault response training for staff and faculty, to be incorporated into sexual harassment training already in place.

**Response Protocols**:

Current practice:
  
Student Services has implemented a checklist that first responders use to guarantee that survivors of sexual assault are given information about all available resources and that all relevant information about the reported incident is gathered. Some students have suggested it is unclear to whom they can report and what will happen if they report to or talk with a college staff member. Little training has been provided to anyone other thanresidence life staff.

Recommended actions:
  
-Create a transparent pathway through which survivors can report assault and receive assistance and support. A flow chart should be used to clearly illustrate each of the possible avenues. These should include: on- and off-campus confidential support, assistance, and medical care, access to a sexual assault forensic exam at a local hospital, the option to report the incident to the college along with information on what will happen after it is reported, and the option to report to the police. A reasonable timeline should be delineated for what the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) calls the &#8220;major stages of the response procedure&#8221;: 1) time to complete a thorough investigation; 2) when both parties should expect a response regarding the outcome of the process; and, 3) time allotted for a possible appeal. While the OCR in its recent Dear Colleague letter suggested that 60 days is the norm for investigating a complaint, we recommend there be flexibility to adjust timelines according to specific cases in order to ensure proper processing.
  
-Produce a comprehensive resource (web or paper) distributed to all staff and faculty at the start of the academic year, enumerating all options available to the survivor. This provides clear guidance for the cases in which a survivor chooses to turn to any staff or faculty member for help.
  
-Create an integrated response checklist for those officially in charge of responding to sexual assault cases (e.g. student services deans, community safety officers, resident directors), in order to ensure a consistent response when a survivor of sexual assault comes forward.
  
-Create a sexual assault response packet given to all survivors that includes clear and concise information on reporting options, the rights of all parties involved in a sexual assault, and information on resources and accommodations.
  
-Continue the current practice of immediate threat assessment for all sexual assault reports in order to ensure general campus safety.
  
-Provide mandatory annual training for all potential first responders (community safety officers, dean of students office staff, student services staff, residence directors, housing advisors, Health and Counseling Center staff, faculty) that includes a structured response checklist to guide the conversation with survivors. Information in the training should include a review of the integrated checklist and information on rape trauma syndrome, key strategies to support a survivor, information on campus and community resources, information on bringing a complaint through our sexual assault process complaint board, information on reporting the incident to the police and health related information.
  
-Develop vastly enhanced web resources (a dedicated page from the Dean of Student&#8217;s web site with multiple and easily visible access points) that provide comprehensive information including the above-mentioned flow chart summing up the different reporting pathways, timelines, on- and off- campus resources, confidentiality regulations, availability of health-related resources (i.e. how to get a rape kit, general medical health care), as well as information regarding different kinds of interpersonal violence. Web resources should include rights and responsibilities for both the survivor and the accused.
  
-Have community safety staff trained in investigating sexual assault cases.
  
-Add advocate positions for both survivors and accused. Advocates would be available 24/7 and would undergo relevant training.
  
-Create clear criteria for establishing in what cases we would forward the charge to law enforcement.

**Internal Disciplinary Procedures**:

Current practice:
  
The student survivor may submit a complaint directly to the Judicial Board, or student services or other staff may submit a complaint naming the students involved. When an allegation that a student has committed sexual assault is brought forward to any staff or faculty, student services staff investigate the complaint and, if appropriate, take immediate steps to safeguard the community. If the complainant does not wish to file a complaint, student services or other staff may file a complaint. The Judicial Board hears cases of sexual assault, documents its findings of fact and makes recommendations to the president regarding violations of policy and the honor principle and any attendant sanctions. This year, the board received some additional sexual assault training.

Recommended Actions:
  
-Create a hearing board separate from the current student Judicial Board and exclusively devoted to hearing sexual assault cases. This board will be comprised of trained student services professionals. The rationale for a separate board includes the need for prompt and effective processing, the importance of privacy (enhanced by restricting the exposure of these cases to staff), and the inherent psychological challenges for both adjudicators and participants in cases with this degree of sensitivity and complexity.
  
-Ensure that reasonable options are available and offered for parties to participate in sexual assault hearings when the complainant and/or respondent wish to avoid direct contact. These might include skype or telephone.
  
-Those who are charged with adjudicating sexual assault cases must receive significant and substantive training consistent with best practices in sexual assault adjudication, which would include the following: sensitive questioning strategies, hearing options (e.g., video conferencing), use of forensic evidence, role of alcohol and other drugs, judicial decision-making, and victim response to trauma.

**Support Services**:

Current Practice:
  
Reed&#8217;s Health and Counseling Center provides counseling and medical services to survivors of sexual assault. Health and counseling staff have expertise in responding to sexual assault, psychological and physical trauma, treatment of sexually transmitted infection, and symptoms and syndromes related to assault (e.g., PTSD and depression). Staff have received training on emergency procedures, on community-based resources, and on procedures for referral for medical and/or counseling services as needed.

Recommended Actions:
  
-Conduct ongoing training of staff on sexual assault.
  
-Clearly publicize counseling and health resources specifically available to survivors, including information on obtaining rape kits.

**Collaboration with External Authorities**:

Current practice:
  
Staff attend meetings of the Multnomah County Sexual Assault Response Team and the Oregon Attorney General&#8217;s Sexual Assault Task Force. Staff have established relationships with the Portland Police Bureau and with the district attorney&#8217;s office. Reed staff have established a relationship with Portland Women&#8217;s Crisis Line, including hosting a summit and inviting it to campus to conduct training with the student-run Sexual Assault Task Force.

Recommended Actions:
  
-Continue regular participation in the Multnomah County Sexual Assault Response Team and the Oregon Attorney General&#8217;s Sexual Assault Task Force to support networking with law enforcement and victim service agencies.
  
-Conduct an annual review of the Memo of Understanding with the Portland Police Bureau regarding practices related to sexual assault and other forms of violence.
  
-Gather key representatives from the College, the Portland Police Bureau, and victim service agencies several times a year to review Reed-specific response protocols and any memoranda of understanding. This recommendation is based on a national best practice of creating campus-based &#8220;community coordinated response teams.&#8221;
