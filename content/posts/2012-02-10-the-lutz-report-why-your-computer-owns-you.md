I want to take you on a thought experiment. Imagine your computer. Sit down in front of it. Log on. Check your email. Stalk the person you plan on fucking during Renn Fayre. Then, calmly and with complete confidence in your actions, reach necxt to you and Grab the paint can sitting innocently next to the five casters that support you and your chair. Smoothly, whip the flat head screwdriver from the glamourous depths of your $50 bra. It’s okay, you deserve to feel sexy, even if it’s like 10 meals at a food cart’s worth of sexy. Anyways, take the Philips head, wield it urposefully as you drive it under the cap of the can of eggshell white. Fuck, you didn’t ask for eggshell. Man, whatever. It’ll do the job. A slightly off-white, crack-powder job. Goddamn it. No, really get over it. Okay, the can is open. Check out that sweet film of opaque paint-component. Like that shit that you really wish would just GTFO when you’re trying to eat your yogurt. Well, today, you don’tt care. You look straight into that spawn of hell that is imperfect paint mix-age, and you embrace it.

By embrace it, I mean you take the can in both hands and you tip it slowly, degree by degree. Suddenly, it’s radian by radian and it’s moving so fast and you don’t even have time to reconsider your actions and and and and you’ve never felt so free and look at those curling eddies goddamn those fluid mechanics I’ve never seen such beautiful chaos. And the paint drips gently down the million pixels that once flashed you corrections to lecture tickets, updates from groups you really should get involved in, and, most importantly of all, the porn that you periodically clear your browser for. Like a jealous lover, the paint explores regions that should be left unexamined. Oil based, well at least they got that right.

Just take in that glorious sight. Oh, it’s hit the desk. Mmm, building up, expanding radii, screaming their encouragement. Oh man, what’s next. Let the anticipation course throught your blood, it makes your fingernails grow long and furious, the hair on your back gets dark and the filaments define themselves so clearly against that scaly green that’s been developing for weeks. It’s getting harder to hide… You’ve had to pass off the bit on your ear as experimental makeup, blaming a random theatre class. It’s okay, most people don’t know the theatre is still a physical thing. All the world’s a stage, motherfuckers. Man, if that was a thesis topic, I’d be all over that. Adding motherfuckers to the end of poetry. “Hey get against the wall, motherfuckers” Okay maybe MGMT isn’t poetry, but amazing how “motherfuckers” turns aggressive seduction into mob execution.  “They fingers make early flowers, when god lets my body be Mutherfuckers.” E.e.cummings motherfuckers.

Okay no really, the steady progression of beastiality has quickened itself to the pace of James May behind a Lambourghini: Yeah, it could be faster, but you’re still kinda concerned that it will end in disaster. You try to express your concern in a mild groan, but it comes out as a lusty roar. Oh dear, it’s progressed farther than you thought. Now you can’t think, there’s only this burning, all-consuming desire to feel flesh between your molars, to feel blood shoot up your nose as you breath in, your face buried deeply in the bend of his neck. You’re not breathing, you’r inhaling and exhaling, primal instinct driving the mechanics of your body. Fluid passes through your esophagus and your stomach rejoices at the iron and the plasma that it digests in one, two, a third stomach. Oh man, your organs are multiplying. Really, didn’t you notice? New voices edge their way into your conciousness. Freshborne, but knowing all you’ve ever known. You’ve read dune, right, that shit’s fucked up. Frank Herbert was a Mycologist. Anyways, they’re getting stronger, you’re paralyzed, you’re fading, you want to ask them where they came from, they don’t hear you, you’re \___\___\___\___\___\___\___\___\___\___\___\___.

Moral: Don’t fuck up your computer, you’ll turn into an animal.
