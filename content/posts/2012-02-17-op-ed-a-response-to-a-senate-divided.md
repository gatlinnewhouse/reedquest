_Dana Loutey is a current Senator._

I’m writing in response to Kieran Hanrahan&#8217;s [editorial last week][1] because I thought it left out some important details. During the Senate meeting on 2/2, SB President Brian Moore passed out a proposal to increase Honor Council (HC) wages. I&#8217;d like to explain why I and other senators believe the proposal should be handled through Student Body Wage Review Committee (SBWRC).

All SB positions on campus are underpaid, and many students, including HC members, feel short-changed. When they ask Senate about increasing their wages, Senate has responded for the past few semesters (since the SBRWC existed), by saying that SBWRC will be surveying all SB positions. The SBWRC exists for that purpose. We don&#8217;t have an unlimited pool of money, so even if every student paid by the SB came to Senate citing the fact they work &#8220;a lot&#8221; and their job is very important–even if they had full-fledged proposals–we would still not be able to give everyone all the money they requested. We would need to split a limited amount of money amongst all of these people, and comparing &#8220;a lot&#8221; to &#8220;a lot&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make for good criteria to change wages. We would need to gauge exactly how often people work and how difficult their jobs are, and _then_ allocate our limited pool of money. The SBWRC was created to do this job. (Senate as a whole doesn’t do the job because the SBWRC is a small, dedicated group of Senators and students that will do the job more efficiently, and because students on the committee are not on SB payroll.)

During the Senate meeting on February 2, after the SBWRC was already in place, Brian passed out a proposal to increase the wages of HC members without information about the number of hours worked, etc. Instead, one ex-member of HC, Brian Moore, testified that they work &#8220;a lot&#8221; and everyone agreed that their work is important. But again, &#8220;a lot&#8221; is pretty vague, and it&#8217;s only coming from one person. Even if we heard they worked 8 hours per week, we couldn&#8217;t give them $80 per week because if we were to pay every SB position by that standard, we&#8217;d run out of money pretty quickly and student groups would lose funding. So we need to cut some percent of what HC should be earning, and we&#8217;d want that percent to be equal across the board for all SB positions. But we don&#8217;t know that total amount we&#8217;d need to cut (which would give percent) unless we survey all SB positions. _That&#8217;s_ the job of the SBWRC and _that&#8217;s_ why some of us felt it should go through the SBWRC. It wasn’t that we felt an evaluation of HC’s wages was unimportant.

To illustrate this point, I brought up a scenario in which some student holding another SB position told a Senator that they felt they really deserved a wage increase–say $100/month. The convention for the last couple of semesters has been that Senate would inform them of the SBWRC, and say hopefully you’ll get a little sumpin’. And imagine that student found out that Senate later passed the HC proposal without going through SBWRC. Wouldn&#8217;t that student be rightfully pissed off? When Jenny Calvert-Warren brought up the possibility that we were only talking about HC as a special case because Brian Moore used to be an HC member (and I later reiterated this point), she was pointing out that Brian’s status as SB president resulted in a proposal being presented to Senate, whereas any other request of this sort would have been redirected to SBWRC. As Johannes pointed out, Brian could only bring up to Senate the issues with which he is familiar. I agree, but I think those issues should be redirected to the SBWRC just like everyone else’s issues with wages.

Senator Marie Perez argued that HC should be exempt from this standard because the low wages made the position inaccessible to students with larger financial obligations. I think that same inaccessibility applies to all of the SB positions since they are all underpaid.  Even if we all felt comfortable differentiating HC from other SB positions because of the value we place on the Honor Principle, to me that would only mean we’d make it a _priority_ to evaluate HC, but not to make arbitrary decisions as opposed to informed ones.

The issue is not that the &#8220;old Senate&#8221; is so entrenched in their beliefs that they can&#8217;t see HC should be paid more. We all agreed they should be paid more. But we also agree there are a lot of other SB positions that should be paid more, and it would only be fair to make an informed decision before promising any one group an arbitrary wage increase that we can&#8217;t necessarily provide to everyone else.
