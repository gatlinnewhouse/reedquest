Reed Alumna Jessica Glenn ‘06 had just lost her health insurance and didn’t know where to turn. She had been divorced, and even though she was a healthy thirty year-old, insurance companies turned her down because she was self-employed.

A friend recommended the OHSU Richmond Clinic at 3930 SE Division in Portland, where Glenn received high-quality, low-cost healthcare. Since visiting the clinic, Glenn has joined the group’s board of directors.

“Sometimes clinics for low-income people look like a last option where insured people would never go if they could avoid it, but Richmond is really beautiful with great facilities and world class doctors,” Glenn said. Today, she has private health insurance, but continues to serve on the Richmond Clinic Board of Directors as Treasurer.

Richmond Clinic is part of the OHSU system, and has been serving SE Portland for the past 7 years.

“[They] believe in reaching the patient, not the other way around,” Glenn said. As a patient, she was impressed by the clinic’s patient-centered approach to healthcare. When patients visit the clinic, doctors do their best to minimize the number of trips patients need to take to the clinic. Each patient has a medical team assigned to them, which provides continuity of care. In additional to complete medical care, the clinic treats drug abuse, depression, and incorporates mental and behavior health into the wellbeing of their patients.

She hopes students at her alma mater, Reed, will make use of the Richmond Clinic. “If you don’t have insurance, you really should take that next step and start the process of becoming a registered patient. Don’t wait until something bad happens.”

At Richmond Clinic the lowest cost is $25/visit. Once patients are fully enrolled in the Richmond system, they receive a sliding scale that can be applied at any specialists’ office in the OHSU system as long as they get a referral.

“The pharmacy has lowest possible prices for the list of meds we offer, and our doctors work hard to prescribe from the formulary. They steer away from using brand new designer meds.” Among other medications, prescriptions for birth control are usually between 1 and 2 dollars.

In the future, the Richmond Clinic hopes to offer dental services. In Portland, those without dental insurance have the option of going to a local dental school for free and low cost dental treatment. But quality of care at such low-cost dental clinics can be poor.

“No matter what’s wrong, even if there’s another way to treat it, they pull the tooth,” explains Glenn, who routinely hears patients at Richmond Clinic refer to missing teeth as “poverty gaps.” Pulling a tooth is less labor-intensive than performing a root canal. Richmond Clinic sees a need for improved access to low-cost dental care, and they expect to be able to offer quality dental services in the future.

Oregon’s unemployment rate was 10.6 percent last month, unchanged from August 2010, according to the Associated Press. The US unemployment rate was 9.6 percent in September, also unchanged from August. When people lose their jobs, they usually lose whatever insurance package is granted through their employer.

The number of uninsured adults rose by 3 million in 2009, which means that as many as 1 in 5 people remain uninsured in the US. According to a recent report by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 46.3 million American adults had no health insurance in 2009.

According to recent census data, Richmond Clinic’s target service area, extending from 82 and Johnson Creek to roughly Division, scored “high need” in all of the needs indicators including access to doctors and frequency of smokers, teen moms, asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity, and others.

Located at 3930 SE Division, Richmond Clinic meets a pressing need in the community.

Although Reed is slightly West of Richmond Clinic’s target area, uninsured people in the Reed Community are welcome at Richmond Clinic. They accept new patients by phone on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month at 503.418.3900.

It takes about a month to complete financial screening and become a patient, but once you’re in the system, appointments are available in a day. So call the number and get registered, Reedies!
