_This was written in response to the original ‘Bathroom Confessional’ letter, not the revised version found [here][1]._

Last week in the Quest, someone wrote an op-ed in opposition to California’s new trans rights law, advocating instead for “female-only bathrooms.” As a woman I have a huge problem with this.

It has been suggested to me that last week’s article was an elaborate joke. If this is the case, feel free to stop reading here.

Initially, I want to start with the assumption that I found most offensive: that trans women and girls are not women and girls. To suggest that a female-only space would exclude trans women is not only hurtful to trans women on an individual level, but fueling the fire of a long-standing bitter and unnecessary conflict between trans rights groups and the feminist movement; a conflict which, in reality, undermines the legitimacy of both groups.

The call for a space free from “the male gaze,” I find hopeful and emboldening. However, the insinuation that such a space would be violated by trans women subjecting cis women to a sexualized gaze is offensive and ignorant. To say “women&#8230;. [need a space] free from male observance and judgment” both groups trans women with men (which they are not) and plays upon the insidious myth of trans women using female bathrooms as a setting for flirtation and sexual approach. Such an argument, painting trans women as men in disguise, has been used by numerous conservative groups to deny trans women rights.

I was not only struck by the transphobic nature of the “Bathroom Confessional,” but its stereotyping of all women. I believe deeply in the power and necessity of a women’s culture in a society as patriarchal as ours, but to suggest that this culture is predicated on “cry[ing]” “put[ing] on makeup” “gossip[ing]” “fight[ing]” and swapping tampons angers me. The argument itself doesn’t make sense&#8211; a bathroom is inherently an artificially constructed space because you have to go to it, a naturally constructed space would be one where women gather organically and willingly&#8211; but it also reinforces the stereotype that women are composed largely of their superficial characteristics. It reduces a women’s space to something akin to a nail salon or a hairdresser’s. It’s a bathroom from a bad 80’s teen movie, where the women are uniformly dramatic, typically feminine, and bond solely over material goods.

Incorporating transphobia and materialistic stereotypes of femininity into modern feminism cripple the movement, rather than strengthen it. In an ideology whose foundation _is_ the re- conception of gender and its societal roles, it’s antithetical to demand bathrooms for only certain types of women.
