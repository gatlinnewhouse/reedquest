Amidst growing pressure from internal and external sources, the Ad Hoc Committee on Sexual Assault (COSA) has chosen to expedite the submission of their findings regarding Reed’s procedure for the education, prevention, and adjudication of sexual assault. Initially scheduled for presentation by May 2 at 4 PM, members of the committee expressed a desire to present their findings as soon as possible. They will meet on Friday to revise the document and may submit them to the President’s Office as soon as April 25.  Honor Council will host a community forum dedicated to the issue of sexual assault on April 27.

Convened in August 2010, COSA exists to develop a set of comprehensive recommendations for improving the college’s approach to sexual violence. In an initial directive, President Diver explained, “I have convened the committee in service of our obligation to do all that we can to reduce the likelihood that any Reed student will be the victim of sexual assault, and to ensure that any student who is a victim of sexual assault receives the best possible support.”

While the committee’s recommendations are non-binding, the President may choose to accept any or all of them as per his discretion, and they are informed by a review of comparative procedures at peer institutions across the country. Topics of discussion amongst the ten members have included the role of the Judicial Board in adjudicating cases of sexual assault, systematizing community-wide education, locating support services in a central hub, and bolstering collaboration with off-campus resources such as the Portland Women’s Crisis Line.

Despite movement through formal institutional channels, students frustrated with the slowness of substantive change began circulating a petition on Monday, April 18, under the name of Students for Sexual Assault Support Services. The petition calls for the removal of sexual assault from the purview of JBoard, the creation of a position for an Assistant Dean for Sexual Assault Prevention and Advocacy, a female-identified staff liaison for the Women’s Center to serve as a resource for survivors and their supporters, and the release of names of community members found responsible for incidents of sexual assault.

As of Wednesday evening the group had collected more than 600 signatures. They will submit the petition to President Diver on Friday, stating, “We require a public statement from President Diver by 12 PM Tuesday, April 26, committing to the implementation of all the above demands by the start of the Fall 2011 semester.”

On Tuesday nearly 200 people gathered in the Student Union for a “General Assembly” to continue conversations begun at the Reed Union on April 4. Lightly moderated by a small group of students, the discussion quickly turned to the demands of the petition, tensions between the Honor Principle and legalistic approaches to sexual violence, and the capability of their peers to constitute an unbiased fact-finding body for the adjudication of Honor Cases.

Reed is not alone in grappling with the pressing issue of sexual assault. On March 15, a group of students filed a Title IX lawsuit against Yale University, alleging the school’s policies and procedures contribute to a hostile environment for female members of the community. Similar suits have been filed against other schools in subsequent weeks. On April 4, the federal Department of Education released a 19-page directive, known colloquially as the “Dear Colleague” letter, to colleges and universities across the country regarding the proper treatment of sexual harassment and abuse under Title IX.

Eleven incidences of sexual assault have been reported to Reed College Community Safety this academic year.

Nine cases of sexual assault were brought to the student Judicial Board in the past five years and six were found in favor of the complainant, said Mike Brody, Dean of Student Services. Students found to violate the sexual assault policy were suspended and, in one case, expelled.

Brody dismissed rumors that staff members have discouraged survivors from reporting instances of assault, stressing that his staff members are trained to guide students to resources.

“A student might have come forward to someone and it’s easy to imagine that person saying it’s going to be hard for that to hold up in court,” Brody said. “I can see how that would sound to a survivor – ‘don’t go to the police.’ So I’ve counseled my staff to say, ‘You can go to the police, do you want me to call them?’”

While Brody does not have concerns about the ability of an all-student Judicial Board to oversee the Honor Process, he conceded that “if students perceive an all-student judicial board as an impediment, that’s a problem.”

Modifying the structure of the Judicial Board would require alteration of the Student Body Constitution and the Community Constitution; such a change requires approval by a majority of the student body, resident faculty, the college president, and Board of Trustees. It is unlikely that such changes could be immediately implemented.

“I have a hard time seeing the benefits of [a student judicial board] outweighing the costs,” Brody said. “It seems to me we’re heading in another direction.”
