In an effort to match up the readings with the paper topics, the new syllabus has bumped up the deadline for the first Hum paper to this Saturday. If you’re anything like I was as a freshman, you have sixteen million ideas swirling around in your head and nothing on paper. Or maybe you have zero ideas and tons of scribbling.

Regardless, you have your first big college deadline and you need to get cracking. This is where a few well-loved library songs from a seasoned procrastinator come in.

**“Boom! I Got Your Boyfriend”**
  
_M.C. Luscious_
  
I’ll be honest with you, this is the first song on my “EgoMixxxxx” playlist. Getting started is all about getting amped and this Salt-N’-Pepa style track will get it bumping. Ever stolen someone else’s boyfriend while working it at the gym? If you did, did you yell “Boom!” as loud as you could the next time you saw his ex? Whatever, me neither. But you’ll be feeling like a BAMF and ready to wail on some Hum 110 in four minutes flat.

“Laugh Love Fuck”**
  
_The Coup_
  
Okay, your intro paragraph is done and it’s time to turn up the base and start cruising. Sure, you’ll probably be stuck in the library until 4:55pm &#8211; but you’ll be there with everyone else in your conference. It’s hard not to feel just fine listening to this 2007 gem from Bay area funk group The Coup. And seriously, this is why we all came to college, isn’t it?

**“I’m Still In Love With You”**
  
_Al Green_
  
A thousand words in and you’re getting a little tired, a little scatterbrained, a little “who cares about this Greek shit anyway?” This go-to classic is like your favorite Sunday morning sweatpants, a Hot Toddie at the end of a long night in the library, or a warm cozy snuggle on a cold rainy day. Take a deep breath – on the other side of this is a rocking Saturday night and that knowledge that you too can make it at Reed.
  
**
  
“Celeshake (Ying Yang Twins vs. Kool & The Gang)”**
  
_A plus D_
  
Done with the writing and it’s time to edit. Take a break, get some Viso, do a little downward dog. I have many fond freshman memories of long walks through the second floor of the library that just happened to take me past that fine-ass senior’s thesis desk that I’d been scoping since Activities Fair. I probably looked like a crazy person but it definitely got his attention and, well, it was all rainbows and ponies from there.
  
**
  
“The World Should Revolve Around Me”**
  
_Little Jackie_
  
Bust out the glitter, the cheap vodka, and turn that mother in! You did it! You finished your first real paper. You’re feeling good, you’re feeling fine. No matter how jaded upperclassmen may seem, we all remember how good that moment felt. We’re all happy for you&#8230;but I still have a fucking thesis proposal to write. So just don’t expect me to jump up and down with you.
