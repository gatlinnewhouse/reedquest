This week, the SEEDS team is leading a campus-wide book drive benefiting students at the Community Transitional School of Portland. The Community Transitional School is a non-profit, private K-8 school for students experiencing chronic poverty-related crises, homelessness, or transitional housing. The school provides transportation to and from school, two meals each day, daypacks, regular health screenings and a safe environment for learning and personal growth. Students of these families deal with issues ranging from economic hardship, domestic violence, busy parents, changing living situations, uncertainty regarding foods, and other concerns related to poverty and the uncertainty that comes with it. These students miss out on a lot of the stability and community that most children are accustomed to, which the Community Transitional School strives to provide to some degree. Even though the state of Oregon has programs in school districts designated to try to reach children in homeless families, many fall through the cracks. Due to this as well as the unreliability of home, family, and transportation, public school isn’t an option for most students who are at the Community Transitional School.

In high school, I was a math and science tutor for the 6th to 8th grade class at the Community Transitional School. Every other week, I would teach an hour of math and science-related concepts to these students. Though it was difficult for tutors like myself to come up with lesson plans and to teach kids on many different levels scientific understanding, the kids generally had a good time at school, considering all the challenges they faced outside of it. They wanted to learn and to help their families. About half of the school’s students moved more than once during the 2007-2008 school year, and most called the school up themselves about changes in housing so that the buses would keep taking them to school.

One of the student needs at the Community Transitional School, in addition to clothes and hygienic products, is books. Many studies have emphasized the disparity in the availability of books in children’s homes from lower income families to those of higher income. The goal behind SEEDS’ book drive is to share books and the possibilities they bring to the students at the CTS. Recognizing how important it was having books around as a kid pushes me personally to share the opportunity that I had with other kids. Even though it is often difficult for homeless students to carry books around with them, giving them some to keep at school is a start.

Most efforts focused on homelessness involve adults and getting them back into the work force. However, the children and youth affected by the adults same families are overlooked by such efforts. SEEDS’ own Mischka Moechter works with the Yellow Brick Road Program as well as volunteers from Reed to provide personal eye-to-eye advocacy, resources and referrals to street-dependent youth. The issues that homeless youth and children face aren’t problems that a typical Reedie faces. Making a difference in a homeless child’s life and working with them early increases the chances of them staying off the streets and getting out of the vicious cycle of poverty.

Buying a book from a Borders doesn’t take a lot. Donation boxes can be found in Commons, the SEEDS office and the faculty lounge through April 10th. Books that are new or good condition, and are appropriate for grades K-8 are appreciated.
