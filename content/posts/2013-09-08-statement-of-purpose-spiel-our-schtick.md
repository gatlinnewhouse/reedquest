In a dark and damp corner of the Quest office, a pile of bound archive books of Quests past molders into pulpy mush, unread for decades. These Quests are strange relics from the past, full of cigarette ads and casual, antiquated sexism. Many things in these ancient issues are better left in the past, but one phrase that your loyal editors came upon somewhere in the Madmen-era Quests has stuck with us. That phrase, placed underneath a typically classy header, states: “Reed College’s Organ of Expression.” This statement has hit a cord among us editors, and we seek to make it the motto of this year’s round of weekly news, features, and campus oddities. As editors (0r Queditors, if you will), we look forward to supplying the student body with investigative and thorough reporting on the news that matters to our community. We are here to serve you, the entire student body and Reed College as a whole. We aim to cover the controversies that you are talking about, and provide a fair and balanced account of any issue that may arise. The Quest is not something removed and locked away in a small office in the basement of the GCCs, only to emerge around lunch on Fridays. The Quest is not just us editors, but it is all of you as well. As such, The Queditors invites you to send in your thoughts in the form of letters and opinion pieces. If you like to write, take photos, or do layout, we’d love to have your help. With the unfolding of this year’s news, we hope to preserve the truth of our shared experience in collaboration with our fellow Reedies. We are here to serve you, Reed. We are your massive, throbbing organ of expression.
