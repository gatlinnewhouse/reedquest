_Chez Commons is a fusion of the food of Commons and the academic artistry of the Reedie.  If you are intrigued by the possibility of writing it, please send your submission (with accompanying photo) to [&#x71;&#x75;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#x40;<span class="oe_displaynone">null</span>&#x72;&#x65;&#x65;&#x64;&#x2e;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;][1] with the subject line “Chez Commons.”_

“Includes wheat, dairy, whine, gluten,” said the sign.  Good enough, I thought.  I was ready for some whine after a long first day of classes.  I fell on my food with the hunger of a Rabelaisian giant.  But before describing the act of creative destruction and primal nourishment we so blithely call “eating,” it would be fruitful to sketch the dish in the perfect state in which it was served, when it more clearly manifested the platonic form of the braised Carlton Farms pork shoulder with cream polenta and vegetable ragù.

Visually, the dish set a shade of deep chestnut (the pork) and dark greenish-red (the ragù) against a grainy backdrop of golden yellow (the polenta), evoking Van Gogh&#8217;s brooding Wheat Field Under Threatening Skies served with ketchup in a gluten-free bun at an awkward reading of James Joyce.  Although its composition reinforced the socially constructed categories of grain, vegetable, and meat, the dish’s name subverted the binary between Italian cuisine and Commons food.

Dissecting the food to begin the ancient process of consumption, I discovered within the pork shoulder a lascivious pink that had earlier been obscured by the curtains of smoky chestnut brown.  As I sampled each part of the triad of food items, I found that the polenta was neither cream nor creamy, while the pork contained the gristle of an early modern playwright whose work retains stock characters of the commedia dell’arte.  I reflected on the paradox of hunger: the object of its desire is also the cause of its demise.  Yet it always arises again, an ineffable piece of the majestic never-ending helix of life.

It was musing on this contradiction that I had a moment of insight.  Unlike the more garden variety Augustinian revelation (with holy books and torrential tears), it contained flavors of the instant of anti-revelation in Sartre’s La Nausée.  I saw, clearly, the entirety of the physical metaphor contained within the dish.  Corny though it may sound, the polenta was the land of the North American continent, and the pre-Columbian Native Americans as well, for they were one with their land.  The hulking piece of pork, perched precariously atop the polenta, was the Great Pig of the American capitalist socio-culturo-economy.

And the ragù? Comrades, the ragù was none other than the pulpy red song of mechanical death arising from the clash of the Great Pig and American people-land, a hypolydian harmony muttered by Bob Dylan.  Sing, muse (it went), of the greed of robber barons and railway magnates, and God Bless America.  I played the halting accompaniment with my steel eating utensils à la John Cage.

The scarce scraps of raw green onions, finally, were those few dissenters who resisted this lugubrious process of devastation.  Their end was fitting: indiscriminately swallowed hastily by the pig, for I had become the pig.  You are what you eat, the pig said, and I could not help but agree.  And so it began again.
