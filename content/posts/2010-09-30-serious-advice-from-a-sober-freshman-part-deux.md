Some upperclassmen may have been a tad upset by my last article. Believe me: I totally understand. Some of you may not be used to people my age being snarky or otherwise freethinking — except, of course, back when you were this age and were just as sassy as I am.  Regardless, I do understand how unpalatable advice, no matter how sensible or sober, coming from an unqualified freshman is. That is why today I will direct my advice at another demographic: my fellow freshmen.

One of our few collective experiences, Hum lecture, is as much what we make of it as what we are given. So it might be helpful to mention some ground rules of lecture etiquette that could make us all more grateful to be there.

Don’t pack up before the lecturer is finished. It’s hard enough to concentrate on the last five minutes of a meandering speech without fighting the rustling of papers and sounds of tangible boredom. No class you’re rushing off to is so important that you must force the lecturer into delivering a premature conclusion.

And if there is a class so important that you must humiliate the lecturer, keep in mind you’ll have at least five minutes to get to said class, so there’s really never an excuse.

Fill up the rows all the way to the wall. I don’t know what it is with you early arrivals who prefer to squat the middle of the rows thereby making the insides inaccessible. But please do move in.  Unless you really want my bum in your face as I casually try to move my entire person down three rows, I would just move over if I were you. I don’t have any particular interest in scaling the inside of Vollum, and you should know I will not be so apologetic when I accidentally kick you in the face.

Do your online shopping in your dorm. I understand how essential that loose-fitting boatneck tee or that vintage-looking vegan-leather satchel is to your self-image as a sexily underdressed boho, but your money is still good at Urban Outfitters at 10 o’clock. It is just unfairly distracting to fellow freshmen who are trying to focus all their energy on mastering the pedigree of Egyptian gods.

Don’t come to lecture hungover or so incredibly sleep-deprived that you nod off. I promise you your bed is infinitely more comfortable than is a Vollum lecture chairs. Celebrating Thirsty Thursdays is not going to make Friday lecture any more comprehensible, so prioritize (and know that no one will judge you for whatever you deem more important). Just know there is probably nothing more discouraging to the lecturer and fellow freshmen than gazing upon a sea of blank faces and slumped-over bodies.

These suggestions (or requests, rather) are just keeping in mind that Hum lecture is a communal experience. The more into it we all appear, the more into it we’ll all actually be.

I hope this advice was refreshing for the upperclassmen who now know my criticism has no age discrimination. And if you’re all so pissy about this article, I promise I’ll write myself some advice next week.

Rockin’ the casba in the fifth row of Vollum,
