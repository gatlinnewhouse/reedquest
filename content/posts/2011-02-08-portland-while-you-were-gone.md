While most of you pretty young things spent your winter break at home kickin’ it with your homies/parents/grandparents/dog/sofa, all sorts of interesting things happened in this great state of Oregon. Here are some highlights of what you missed:

• A former CIA agent who was serving a 23-½-year sentence after being imprisoned as a Russian spy in Sheridan, OR, had another eight years added to his jail time after he was discovered sending notes to Russia from prison. Espionage! Scandal! So exciting.

• The annual West Coast Beard and Moustache Competition was held at the Crystal Ballroom on January 23rd. Competitors vied for prizes in the categories of Natural Mustache, Freestyle Mustache, Partial Beard, Natural Full Beard, Natural Full Beard with Styled Mustache, and Freestyle Beard. The WCBMC doesn’t discriminate against gender, either – evidently, women are allowed to participate, too. That’s right. Bearded ladies. All up in that place. Sounds like the best party ever!

• The Portland Oregon Hip-Hop Festival turned twelve years old in January… Wait, there’s hip-hop in Portland?

• State representative Mitch Greenlick introduced a controversial bill that would make carrying children under the age of six in bicycle trailers or on the back of bicycles illegal. Parents protested, saying that driving kids around in cars promotes obesity and could result in ADHD (seriously?). I think kids are just happy to get a free ride, and probably couldn’t care less if it was on the back of a bike or on the back of a camel. Actually, a camel would be totally badass. Imagine rolling up to kindergarten on the back of a camel. Insta-popularity!

• Portlandia premiered on January 21st on IFC. The night before, Perfect Couples, a sitcom about couples in Portland, premiered on NBC. Life Unexpected, the CW’s TV series that also takes place in Portland, aired its final episode on January 18th. Everybody’s got PDX fever these days! 

• Nike (headquartered in nearby Beaverton) unveiled their Black History Month 2011 sneaker collection. They are…black. Does anyone else find this kind of awkward?

• After a guy swiped the tips from her jar on January 21st, a bikini barista actually chased the thief all the way onto a bus to get her money back. He only gave her $20 before taking off. Police are still looking for the culprit. What I want to know is, what’s a bikini barista?

• TriMet, adopting new rules for service animals, is rumored to be considering allowing seeing-eye ponies on public transportation soon. I haven’t seen any of those yet, but it would make riding the 19 bus a helluva lot more interesting.

• Also concerning TriMet: Representative Jefferson Smith introduced House Bill 2909. This bill would identify high-crime MAX stops and play classical music at these stations in hopes that it would have a calming effect and reduce crime. I don’t know about you, but I’d be super psyched if they targeted all MAX stations – imagine getting your groove on to a full-orchestra version of “Con Te Partiro” while waiting for the Red line! So awesome! People could bond over their universal love of all things Handel and boogey down to some Brahms, waltz about to Strauss and hold impromptu karaoke sessions to Haydn. Guys, this is the best idea ever.

• According to an annual survey conducted in January of America’s most literate cities, Portland tied for 9th place, alongside St. Louis, MO. Most literate city? Washington, DC, followed by Seattle, WA. Still, it’s nice to know that we’re up there. Keep hittin’ those books, kids!

• Major storms in January caused some serious flooding and even landslides around the Northwest. Guess the bad weather was unavoidable everywhere — I thought it was bad when it snowed every other day in the Mid-Atlantic!

• The North American Arctic Goose Conference was held from January 11th – 15th in downtown Portland. Are they why there were geese all over the front lawn these past few days? Did they bring them along? ARE THEY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GOOSE SHIT ON MY NEW SHOES???

• It was announced on January 6th that the building that housed Portland’s first Denny’s, built in 1963, will be demolished and replaced with a nightclub in hopes of “bring[ing] a lot more nice people [to the area],” said owner Foo-Hong Foong. Currently, the location is being used by Galaxy Restaurant & Lounge, a karaoke joint. Local residents have been protesting the demolition, presumably because of nostalgia, but potentially because they don’t want nice people hanging around. Think about what that would do to the neighborhood.

• An 81-year-old man received a 3-month sentence and $5,000 fine for voting under the names of his deceased son and brother. Guess he really took the words “Every Vote Counts” to heart.

• It was discovered that, just as New York has a bedbug problem, Portland has flea issues. Seriously. That would explain why some of you can’t stop itching yourselves in the library… that could also be attributed to lack of showering, but I’m going to go ahead and give you the benefit of the doubt. If you live with pets, though, be sure to check for those pesky buggers!

• Intel, Oregon’s largest employer, announced its plans to build a new research and development facility in the Portland area. They’ve even gone ahead and invested a cool $6 billion into the project. You might find a real job (other than Permanent Temp) post-grad after all!
