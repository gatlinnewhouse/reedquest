I had an epiphany while I was organizing my underwear drawer this summer. I’m used to separating my knickers into “no-show” and “for show,” but when I looked at the mountain of colorful, crazy undies in my laundry basket, I knew that it was time for a change.

I had all sorts of underwear: bikini, hipster (lolz), thong, boyshorts, cotton, nylon, lace, frilly, bow-covered, rhinestone-decorated…the list was endless. And being the type to always draw life-changing conclusions from the seemingly mundane, I interpreted this as a sign – life is too much fun to be categorized into only two categories! And I most definitely shouldn’t be buying underwear based on who would (or wouldn’t) see me in it. I should be buying underwear for ME!

So after payday that week, I hit the town and went underwear shopping. I bought all kinds of crazy fun underwear that I normally wouldn’t have even bothered with. I considered it a transformation from the inside out…literally. Returning home with my epic new collection of underpants, I felt a sense of accomplishment and self-empowerment. It was awesome! I never wanted the feeling to end!

So I guess that’s when my venture into celibacy began. The next night I went out with my girlfriends for dancing and general tomfoolery. I had an awesome time, went home at a reasonable hour (a.k.a. before sunlight), and had no major regrets the next morning. I felt like a new person, and I was so in love with the sensation! I spent the rest of the summer clubbing, going on dates, having fun, and avoiding the S-word.

While staying celibate in the city was pretty easy-peasy lemon-squeezy, I was shocked at just how effortless it is here at Reed. Some websites and college guide books have generously rated the male student body of Reed College with grades as high as a B-, but I only had to take one sweeping look around campus and realize this was being far too kind. The only way I would even consider anyone here was by lowering my standards to simply “not a grizzled hobo,” and even then the pool is severely limited.

The remainder of “datable” guys either already have a girlfriend, have a girlfriend back home, aren’t my type, or are of the notorious man-whore variety (and you don’t want to get with a guy who gets more ass than a toilet seat; it’s simply unsanitary.)

The Reed depression: constant rain, endless amounts of schoolwork, and zero eye candy. It all adds up to getting a whole lot done, and that’s more or less what I need in my life right now – some sanity. No more Four Loko nights and “Dude, Where’s My Car?” mornings (or, as was frequently my case, “Dude, where’s my bra?”) No more painfully hungover walks-of-shame at 7:00 AM where I studiously avoided the judgmental looks of early-morning senior citizen joggers enjoying the Canyon. No more bruised knees and no more bruised ego. I’m just so…over it.

Like my stint with vegetarianism, I’m doing it to challenge myself. I want to see how much I can stretch my personal boundaries for independence, and so far it’s been great. I can get dressed in the morning knowing I’m going to live the day for me and only me.

My friends, both here at back home, have been making bets to see how long I’ll last (encouraging, I know.) And I know myself – like my short-lived meat-free food diet, I’m not doing this because it’s a permanent life choice; I’m doing it because it’s giving me the proper mindset for where I am in my life right now.

A lot of things are the same at Reed this year: Commons still mercilessly overcharges for its food, the hipster-to-normal kid ratio is still remarkably skewed in the formers’ favor, I am still assigned more reading to do each night than is reasonable or physically possible, ninjas still roam campus, and nutria still scamper underfoot. But I feel different. I am different. So is my underwear drawer. And together, we’re gonna have a great year.﻿
