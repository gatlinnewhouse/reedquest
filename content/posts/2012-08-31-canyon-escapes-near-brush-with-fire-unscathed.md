While much of Oregon faced the state’s worst wildfires in more than a century, the Canyon had a near brush with a blaze of its own.

Two “unknown individuals” detonated a firecracker near the land bridge during the Weapons of Mass Distraction fire show on August 22, according to Director of Community Safety Gary Granger. Granger says, “The CSO who saw explosion responded within 60 seconds and used a fire extinguisher inside a residence hall. Because he got there so quickly, the fires were small and controlled by the extinguisher.”

Greeni Sullivan ’14, a member of Weapons of Mass Distraction, says that the firecracker was set off “right next to all of our fuel—that&#8217;s five plus gallons of very, very flammable liquid. The explosion would&#8217;ve been pretty catastrophic.”

The three small fires started by the explosion did not cause any “serious damage,” but, Granger says, “The grass and some low bushes in the Canyon are extremely dry and combustable due to the fact that we have not had measurable rain in weeks. Additionally, the location was on a hillside that sloped up toward a residence hall, and, had the fires spread, they would have gone uphill toward the residence fairly rapidly.” Granger adds, “since the fires were started subsequent to an explosive device having been detonated, the crime is felony arson.”

Shortly after the explosion, a CSO spotted two people, described as “male, small builds, wearing shorts, one with a plaid shirt and black backpack&#8230; the CSO who saw them felt that they were small for college students and possibly juveniles,” and began pursuit on foot, but lost sight of them near Naito/Sullivan. Community Safety assumed that the individuals fled north off campus and called in police to help search the surrounding area. The suspects were not found.
