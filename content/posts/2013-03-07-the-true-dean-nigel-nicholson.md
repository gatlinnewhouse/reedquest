Nigel Nicholson will become Reed’s newest Dean of Faculty on June 1, 2013. Nicholson was one of three candidates subjected to round after round of interviews addressing their standpoints on academic mission, which policies to change, new majors, fund allocations, diversity, and all other topics relevant to the post.

What stood out about Nicholson? Senator John Iselin, who served on the student board that interviewed the candidates says Nicholson wanted to de-emphasize need-blind aid, based on the fact that Reed simply can’t afford to, a fairly controversial stance. Iselin states that Nicholson believes college funds can be used to provide financial aid to a point, and can then be used to improve the new and existing academic goals of the college.

But beyond the academic and political policies of the candidates, what traits does a Dean of Faculty need? Reed should have “confidence in their leadership,” says Iselin, adding that what stood out to him __about Nicholson was that “he was realistic.” Professor Jan Mieszkowski, who teaches Humanities and German and served on the faculty board that selected the Dean, says that Nicholson has always been “extremely respected by his peers as a teacher, a scholar, and a first-rate administrator.”

So what of the man himself? Nicholson’s office is on the second floor of the ETC, his desk chair positioned perfectly to face out his window, which looks toward the language houses. His dog, Toby, lies in the middle of the floor.  Nicholson advises that Toby is blind and will ignore you if you don’t pet him. Toby’s blindness is ironic, Nicholson points out, as he was meant to be a guide dog.

“It’s an exciting prospect,” says Nicholson of his new job. He says, however, that he’s always seen himself as more of an educator than an administrator. “I love having students,” he says, and adds and that he’ll be loathe to give that up. He says, “the job ‘Dean’ gets bigger every year.” It’s also a temporary position. “I serve at the will of the faculty,” Nicholson says, and adds that he’ll probably be Dean for five to six years at the maximum.

As a classics professor, Nicholson was invited to run a classics institute in Sicily for one year. Nicholson says that besides being an amazing experience for him and his family, it improved him as an educator. “I had gone slightly auto-pilot, and it was good to have a mechanism by which to make everything new—you can innovate in all sorts of ways.” He says that it was hard for his department in that they lost a professor for an entire year, but that he came back with a renewed vigor for teaching. His kids, now 11 and 13, entered Italian schools during their stay in 2008/2009, and were fluent by the end of the year.

When asked whether there was anything the Student Body should know about him, he says that faculty lives are complex, just like student lives, but that he does spend a fair amount of time “keeping fit,” primarily by playing squash.

He still doesn’t know whether Toby, his dog, will be coming along to the Dean&#8217;s office, as he tends to shed too much.
