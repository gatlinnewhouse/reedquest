_A Letter from a Reed Alumnae_

Dear Reedie,

Two weeks after I graduated from Reed I drove over 2,000 miles to the Mississippi Delta to teach 6th grade science for Teach for America. Unless you have been trapped in the bubble for the past few years, you have probably heard of TFA. For those poor souls who have not left the Hauser library since 2006, let me give you a quick summary: TFA places naïve college grads as full-time teachers in the most unsuccessful schools in the country and asks them to bring students who are years behind up to grade level. I am in my second year and can say without a doubt that TFA has been the most rewarding and insane experience of my life.

The reason I am writing you this letter is YOU can still apply to Teach for America. Are you relishing thesis hell? Are you an English major who audits Pat&#8217;s Advanced Synthetic Organic Chemistry course in your free time? Do you hate sleep? Then Teach for America is for you! TFA has been recruiting at Reed, but perhaps because of their sleek corporate image they are having trouble attracting Reedies. This is unfortunate, because I believe that due to their masochism Reedies are uniquely prepared to undertake the challenges of teaching in a low-income community. 

I have way too much to say about my two years teaching in the poorest, fattest, and most teen-pregnant state in the union, so I decided that I would give you a list of ten things that have happened to me and my students this week (December 13-17, 2010). I hope these anecdotes will communicate to you the hope I have for a future for my 6th graders and the immense challenges they face. 

1. My students scored an average of 88% on the life sciences portion of a practice state exam. Last year only 18% of 8th graders in our district passed the state science exam (a passing score is a 50%). We celebrated by raising our goal from 80% to 90%.

2. The heat at our school has been broken for 3 weeks. When the temperature in my classroom dipped below 30, our class pets, 13 guppies, expired. 

3. Jametrius came after school to re-take Quiz 11, since it was the only quiz or test where he scored below 100.

4. Tuesday: I&#8217;m pretty sure I had the swine flu (is that still a thing?) but I can&#8217;t stay home from school because our district decided to pay tens of thousands of dollars for consultants instead of allocating enough money to the substitute fund.

5. Ryan gives me a Christmas card with the following note: “I like everything in this class. I like how you teach Ms. Shumer too. I wish other teachers can teach like you, cause you have the easiest class cause how you teach. Its really nothing I don&#8217;t like in Ms. Shumer class. Tell you the truth, first I thought you was mean, now I know you just be strick about our work, but everything else you are great.”

6. Thursday: Our district calls a half-day but does not change the bus schedule. Result: 400 children who think they get out at 12:00 P.M. but cannot actually get home until 3:30 P.M.

7. After two long weeks of teaching the reproductive system, my students finally conclude that there is a connection between sex and pregnancy. 

8. You may not know this, but it is legal to hit children in Mississippi. In an effort to use less corporal punishment, my principal instituted the now infamous “Cougarbucks.” Students are rewarded with Cougarbucks for good behavior. Unfortunately, Cougarbucks have gone the direction of German currency during the Weimar Republic. Though most kids have dozens of Cougarbucks, it is currently impossible to redeem them for anything.

9. My students design an awesome experiment to test whether using hand sanitizers lowers the number of bacterial colonies that grow on a nutrient agar plate. They use their knowledge of experimental design to write a hypothesis, design controls, and conduct the experiment.

10. Hundreds of tiny ants that are a perpetual presence in my classroom eat the nutrient agar plates.

At the end of this year, I will be leaving the Mississippi Delta to go to graduate school in Evolutionary Biology. Though I am ready to sleep again at night, I am heartbroken to leave my students. My experience in TFA has only strengthened my belief that the achievement gap between middle-class and low-income students can be closed. My students are brilliant, resilient, and funny. But most of all, they are kids. I am leaving the Delta. I am leaving the feral dogs, the projects, and the crumbling schools, but they can&#8217;t. They need adults in their lives who believe in them, who will push them towards college. I am asking you to be one of those people. 

Application deadline: February 4, 2011.
