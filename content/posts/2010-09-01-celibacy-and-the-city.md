_&#8230; except for that one foursome_

**John Doe**

After eighteen years of celibacy, I got comfortable. It became easy to just drink a bottle of wine, come home, and just masturbate myself to sleep. Weekend after weekend, I would put the effort into looking good and trying to snag myself a boy. It never worked. So I gave up.

Then, this summer, at my local Pride event, I lost my virginity in a foursome.

And let me say, it was bullshit.

Now, perhaps group sex is actually really great. I dunno. It was my first experience with the stuff. What isn&#8217;t great, though, is getting drunk with your coworker and his thirty-two year-old boyfriend, letting them steal your denim short-shorts, and accidently inviting the boyfriend&#8217;s friend to join you.

My crashcourse in carnal knowledge included the joys of anal sex, dirty talkin&#8217;, and why tequila should really be left for those with experience drinking the stuff.

As much fun as it was stumbling my way through the whole thing (read: &#8220;Do you want me to suck your dick?&#8221; &#8220;Yeah? &#8230; Big? &#8230; Daddy?&#8221;), I really don&#8217;t think the experience made me a better person.

I knew things were going to be awkward when we returned to work on Monday (they were) and I didn&#8217;t really think that a foursome would be the best introduction to sex (it wasn&#8217;t). The only redeeming factor was the pizza we ate afterward. Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not going to play the whole &#8220;Oh, woe is me. I didn&#8217;t have a magical first time&#8221; part. I&#8217;m just saying that maybe in the future I should be a little bit more prudent when it comes to mixing alcohol and gay men.

AND YOU SHOULD, TOO.

Yes, that&#8217;s right, this whole piece is nothing more than a somewhat funny anecdote that turns out to be a cautionary tale for all you young&#8217;uns out there.

So, in conclusion, wrap it up before you smack it up, and make sure you&#8217;re not getting sweet talked into dirty talkin&#8217;.
