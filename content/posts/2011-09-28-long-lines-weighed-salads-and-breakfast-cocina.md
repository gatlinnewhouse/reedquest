“Last year, I only had twenty minutes to get from the physics building, to Commons, and then to the third floor of Elliot,” said junior Julia Fisk. “I was late sometimes, but I usually made it. I just feel bad for people who have to do that this year.” A new computer system at Commons has lengthened lines exponentially, keeping Reedies from their lunch and dinner. Many students are irritated by this.

However, this change is not Commons&#8217; fault. “The lines are due to Reed College switching to the Blackboard system for ID cards,” said operations manager Vanessa White. “Bon Appétit switched along with Reed, and we were not aware of the problems that would be created by the switch.” The old system at Commons required only two steps: entering item prices and a swipe. The new system creates three additional steps: pressing the OK button, reentering the total amount, and dealing with the receipt.

The bad news is that there is no clear end in sight. Micros, the company responsible for Blackboard, wants money to solve this issue. White noted that it could be “up to a couple weeks” before a solution is found. If difficulties with Micros persist, the providers could potentially be changed, but White said had “no idea” about specifics, although a solution was “in the works.” Part of this solution will be that the registers do not print a receipt with every purchase. Thus, there is no definite fix for the problem at the moment, and, while a solution is worked out, long lines will continue to frustrate students.

**Weighing salads and pasta**

Towards the end of the summer, Commons began weighing salads, rice and beans, and pasta. Rice and beans were soon returned to their normal cost because of their heavy weight, but salads and pasta have since remained on this system, to the ire of some Reedies and the delight of others. “I don&#8217;t always get a lot of stuff, and I&#8217;d rather pay for the things I&#8217;m getting rather than a whole plate,” said junior Elisabeth Thomas.

This change in the method of pricing was not an increase or a decrease to the cost of salad. “We actually made an full plate salad of a reasonable size and weighed it,” said White. “We then divided the original cost of a salad by the amount of ounces in the salad we made.”

This price change is unlikely to affect the profits of Commons, said White. “There was no price increase. We simply wanted to make the prices of salad equitable. People who had a plate stacked to the top were getting charged the same as people with three pieces of cantaloupe, and that wasn&#8217;t right.”

But some students still find the weighing unfair. Fisk said, “The cost of an item is determined by its weight rather than its price, and that&#8217;s not always fair.”

**Breakfast Cocina**

Breakfast Cocina is an attempt to expand breakfast options at Commons in a tasty way. Mark Harris, Executive Chef of Commons, was looking for ideas when he encountered something similar to Breakfast Cocina at the Portland State farmer&#8217;s market. “What caught my eye was the emphasis on local market produce, and seeing as we have such an abundance of local produce at the moment, it seemed like it would work well,” said Harris.

The idea behind Breakfast Cocina is that, using Mexican-style cuisine, one can make a variety of dishes using only a few different ingredients. This allows Breakfast Cocina to currently offer five choices every morning.

If it is popular, Breakfast Cocina may become a permanent fixture, and acquire a flat-top cooking surface. Harris said, “As for the future, if it continues to be successful then we would look at getting a flat cooking surface and would look to Amparo, who runs that station, to play with the menu and come up with some different ideas.”

**Dish Replacement**

Dish replacement costs at Commons last year remained relatively steady, despite the introduction of Eco-tainers in an effort to decrease them. “There was an initial dip in dish replacement costs last year when we introduced the Eco-tainer, but we didn&#8217;t do a good job of sustaining interest in it,” said White. This year, Commons has attempted to introduce the container to freshmen, with success so far.

**Bagels**

Commons experienced a shortage of bagels the first week of school, as Kettleman (the supplier) continued to send bagels at the level used during the summer. Fortunately for you bagel-lovers, this issue has been resolved and the bagel count is back to normal.

**Jerry**

Jerry, the grill morning cook on Mondays to Fridays, has had to take some time off following open heart surgery. He seems to be recovering. Bridges said that Jerry will be back “as soon as he&#8217;s ready”, and hopefully before the beginning of next semester.

Commons is always looking for student feedback, as the big poster by the water coolers indicates.
