It’s nearly the end of the semester and work is starting to get a lil’ crazy. Though Reedies don’t yet have what has been dubbed “April syndrome,” or that really gloomy feeling you get towards the end of the year when a) it’s been raining for 100 days straight b) you are fed up with your friends/your profs/commons food/humanity at large and c) you haven’t done laundry in a week/have been wearing the same pair of jeans for a week, the blues are starting to settle in a little. Existential crises are getting progressively more common: More than one student has been spotted standing on Commons’ patio, alone and in the rain, staring blankly off into the distance with an empty expression. Sometimes Reed can begin to feel overwhelming, especially when you are greeted every morning by gray skies and drizzle. It could drive anyone nuts.

So you’re wearied and drained and just want to watch Arrested Development all day. Okay. I understand. But wallowing in self-pity and thinking that you’ll never see the sun again cultivates negativity more than anything else, and that’s not healthy at all. It’s important to remember to cut yourself some slack before you actually cut someone.

My guilty pleasure? Bad Girls Club, season 5. It’s easily one of the more ridiculous television programs out there right now. In case you’re not familiar with the premise of the show, the “baddest girls” the producers could find the US of A are selected to live together in a large house in some party city. The girls spend the following weeks boozin’, cruisin’ and wreaking havoc. It’s pretty glorious stuff. Hair extensions are pulled out, punches are thrown, arrests are made and wardrobe malfunctions galore fill each hour-long episode with excitement and drama.

These girls know how to party. In a recent episode fight, a panini maker was hurled across the kitchen. The makers of Bad Girls Club truly picked the cream of the crop with this season, and the results are over-the-top and highly addictive. But despite all the in-house drama, these girls bond like nothing you’ve ever seen. A couple of shots of tequila and a Four Loko later, they’re in the tattoo parlor getting matching ink. When they’re attacked by some haters on the beach or in the club, all the girls instantly jump into the fray, nails out and kicking until they are forcibly dragged apart.

When they make up from a fight, they all go skinny-dipping in the hot tub and swap crazy adventure stories.

“We’re the Bad Girls,” says Brandi, the psychotic stripper from Inglewood, CA. “You’re fuckin’ with one of us, you’re fuckin’ with all of us.”

Maybe there’s something to be learned from these girls. They can teach us an important lesson on sticking together. Yes, we all have beef, but remember that we are a community through thick and thin. Be nice to your fellow Reedies. Even though the Bad Girls bicker and have catfights all the time they know where their loyalty lies. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that we’re all in this together and that tearing each other apart is pulling the whole community down. To shake the blues, I recommend getting involved in volunteer projects (SEEDS is always advertising fun events!), going for walks and just getting the hell off campus. Take a breather before you bitchslap the daylights out of that ignorant fool who cut you in line at the grill. Don’t drown your sorrows with a bottle of wine, cook dinner for yourself and your friends and watch a movie on a Friday night instead. Consider going to the zoo before it’s too cold. If you don’t have one yet, start a journal. Say hi to the person who cleans your dorm and ask how his or her day has been. Most importantly don’t forget that there is life outside of, and after, your Reed experience. And you should really, really watch BGC — it’s great stuff.
