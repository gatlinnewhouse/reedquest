Last Friday various student groups came together for Love and Rage Part Deux, this semester&#8217;s Activism Fair. Intended to allow members of groups like Blue Heron Infoshop, Greenboard, Feminist Student Unit, and Students for Sensible Drug Policy to get to know each other, the event didn&#8217;t seem too successful.

Jason Thu, founder of the Praxis Newsletter, and student active in both Blue Heron and -ism, the Social Justice Group, remarked that the group present at the event was &#8220;the same group of people that&#8217;s always at these things.&#8221;

Furthermore, all the event really consisted of was introductions. It seemed like the &#8220;activist community&#8221; at Reed, evidently a sliver of the already-small student body, would have benefited more from a discussion on how to promote activism on campus and get students more involved. Reed&#8217;s greatest issue is the wall of isolation built with bricks of academia that surrounds it. Having a community concerned with social justice, humanitarianism, and activism should be a goal for each student group, and not having one is the greatest common enemy to the efficacy of the participating groups and threat to their continued existence. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine that if Blue Heron had great student support in pushing for gender-neutral bathrooms, then the fruits of their labor–for which they deserve praise –would have been much greater.

Then again, I&#8217;m a freshman, and maybe I&#8217;m wrongly optimistic about the potential for Reedies to become involved in addressing sociopolitical issues. This year seemed to have started well, with many Reedies participating in the Occupy movement facilitated by various student organizations, but perhaps the senior representatives who were at the Activism Fair know better than I and have long given up hope. Perhaps they&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that attempting to get the Reed community to be active and concerned about social issues that concern it–whether political, ecological, or somehow different–is pointless.

I still have hope, though, even if I understand why some may be discouraged. I think that Reed, filled with as many intelligent people as it is, can come to understand the importance of activism and begin to contradict the notion that apathy runs rampant here, whether or not it already does so now. It needs to be discussed, it needs to be on people&#8217;s minds–it needs to become a major concern because, the fact of the matter is, it is.

It is simply wrong to assume that we are members of the community if we do nothing to attempt to better the community in question, just as it is pointless to have the right to vote, if one never does.
