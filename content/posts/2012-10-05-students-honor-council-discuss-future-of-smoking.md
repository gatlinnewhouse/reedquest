Students tired of walking through smoke on the way to the library gathered with smokers in the Student Union Thursday, Sept. 27 to discuss the future of smoking at Reed. Around 20 smokers and 8 non-smokers sat in a large couch circle to discuss how to smoke honorably at Reed and to gauge others opinions on the matter. One attendee jokingly suggested that the circle should be segregated by smoking preference.

However, this has become a reality for colleges that have designated smoking areas and other campuses have put an outright ban on smoking altogether. “It’s a step towards regulating what students are doing,” one attendee said. Orestis Papaioannou ’15, a member of Honor Council, was quick to add that “ a smoking ban would create huge backlash.”

One of the main sources of contention in regards to smoking at Reed and the most discussed at the meeting was the issue of smoking in the breezeway between the library and the Biology building. This is a high-traffic area, forcing many non-smoking students and faculty to walk through a cloud of smoke on a regular basis. Another issue is littering, particularly at the Paradox. “I’m annoyed by two things going on,” one smoker admitted. “First thing I feel like my fellow smokers are annoying me. The litter around the Paradox is out of control &#8230; I don’t think that should be anyone else’s business to clean up.” ****With regards to non-smokers the “second thing [is] the idea that my health is somehow their business.”** **

A senior at the meeting who regularly smokes in the pool hall, and preferred not to be named, had a different conflict. “My moral sense says I shouldn&#8217;t be smoking, but my asshole self says I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway,” he said after the meeting.

An Admissions intern states he never saw smoking as an issue at Reed, but once he joined the admission office he began receiving inquires from parents of prospective students. On top of that there were an “enormous number of posts [online] asking why is everyone smoking?” He added, that there is a “perspective of Reed where everyone’s a smoker.” Although this is not true, Reed’s smoking rate is around 25%, according to a poll last year, higher than the national average of around 20%.

This brings up the worry that Reed’s smoking policies will change not because of internal reasons, but for the external desire to present a good image to the outside world that disapproves of smoking. “There’s a hierarchy there, as much as we don’t want to talk about it,” one student said, referring to non-smokers who see themselves as being above those who smoke regularly.

However, the core question remains, how can individuals smoke honorably? “No one has a monopoly on what [honor] is,” junior Axcelle Belle, an Honor Council member, said. The conversation turned to what obligations both smokers and non-smokers have to each other, maintaining their freedoms while not impinging on those of bystanders. One attendee simply stated the general rule of smoking at Reed: “Asking is it okay first?”  Others thought stating whether or not the smoke bothered them was a solution.

However, according to some non-smokers present, the awkwardness involved in doing this made it extremely difficult. Also, said one, it would happen so many times a day that it “would start to feel like a crusade. Like you&#8217;re that asshole.” Another person suggested “providing rules in a way easily accessed” as there is a lot of confusion as to where one is actually allowed to smoke and not.  Reed smokers generally want to be courteous and as one member said, “I would just like to know where specifically I can smoke.”

Decisions were reached in the end. First, Student Body President Brian Moore agreed to work toward permanent non-legal signage encouraging smokers to respect non-smoking areas. There was also talk of an umbrella drive as umbrellas would save smokers from the rain and make the breezeway no longer their only shelter. Also suggested was painting ash trays so one could distinguish between ash trays that were there to decrease littering and ash trays that proclaimed smoking was allowed.

Zachary Garris said of the discussion, “I think it went very well. Better than the forum in January 2012” which included faculty, staff, and senate. He thought one of the reasons for the success of the forum was the more even balance between smokers and non-smokers. Of course, as was brought up in the forum, these issues have been circulating for a long time and these discussions have been had many times before. And as Zachary said, “we can only do so much without faculty.”

Belle summed up the meeting in his own words: “I’m always inspired when I have these conversations with Reedies.”
