_By Tess Myers and Uji Venkat_

_“He was as tall and rugged as an alp. One huge eye glared out of the center of his forehead.”—_ Homer_,The Odyssey _

The Odyssey’s Polyphemus is a fictional one-eyed monster, but cyclopic individuals do exist. One-eyed ewes are born to sheep that eat corn lilies while pregnant, severely inbred horses can produce cyclopic foals, and every year a few cases of one-eyed human infants are documented throughout the world.

To understand the cellular and molecular events leading to cyclopia, scientists first have to understand how normal eye formation occurs. New insights into the earliest events of eye formation have come from two recent papers, one published in _Science_ and the other in _Development_. The two different groups captured movies of the cellular movements during early brain development in fish, showing how specialized tissue folding events can turn a simple sheet of cells (termed the anterior neural plate, or ANP) into a tube with grooves (brain) and two bulges (eyes), much like the precise art of origami. Scientists call this process of eye morphogenesis, literally eye shape creation.

The new data, which we discussed in our recent Developmental Neurobiolgy seminar, challenge an old model of eye morphogenesis. From these earlier studies, scientists hypothesized that one part of the anterior neural plate (the future hypothalmus) migrates forward, bisecting the eyefield and creating two optic vesicles.

Contrary to this simple model, the new papers show that more complex cellular movements lead to the formation of two eyes. To understand what happens, imagine Angelina Jolie’s lips, before they smile. The shape of her lips is very similar to the shape of the anterior neural plate (ANP) that gives rise the eyes and forebrain. Based on gene expression patterns, the lip-shaped ANP can be subdivided into four distinct regions of different types of brain tissue: the eyefield tissue in the middle would be surrounded by telencephalon, diencephalon, and hypothalamus tissues. Ms. Jolie’s bottom lip is bordered by a thin layer of telencephalon, the corners of her mouth are made of diencephalon, and the philtrum, (that dip in the top lip) is hypothalamus. These tissue types maintain their same relative position to each other as the forebrain plate folds in the origami-like process of morphogenesis.

Much like the original lips of Jolie, there is a groove running from the philtrum down to the middle of the lower lip, and it is here that the delicate folding of the forebrain begins. As the embryo develops, this groove deepens and pulls away from the plate, pulling tissue down and in to form a structure like the keel of a boat. As this continues, the corners of the “mouth” move towards each other like a smile, and the remaining plate structure begins to close up like the wax rind of a Babybel Cheese. This forms a flat pocket of eyefield tissue with a strip of telencephalon and diencephalon tissue running up the middle, and that “keel” of hypothalamus sticking out below. Not your average Hollywood lip job, but a necessity for proper eye formation.

For decades, scientists have suspected that cyclopia results when these tissue folding events go awry. By studying both wild-type and mutant eyes, one paper suggests that if ANP cells do not locate the appropriate axis of symmetry as a point of convergence, aberrant eye formation results. In our analogy above, the axis of symmetry is the line descending from Angelina Jolie’s philtrum. In the related study, high-resolution movies of individual cell movements within the ANP, suggest that directed migration of individual cells initiates the tissue folding events that facilitate eye and brain morphogenesis.

Though this work was carried out using two different species of fish, it is likely that some of the insights will be useful for understanding cyclopia and other eye malformations in humans and other animals.
