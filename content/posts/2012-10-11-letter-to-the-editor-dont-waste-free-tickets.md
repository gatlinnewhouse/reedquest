To the _Quest_:

As people who do a lot to promote performances by off-campus groups on campus, and to make free attendance possible by members of the community, we would like to call your attention to a situation that disturbs both of us.

FACT: 62 students, faculty, and staff members signed up to attend last Saturday&#8217;s concert of Persian music.  Another dozen or so phoned the sponsoring organization to ask for free tickets.

FACT: the sponsors, members of the local Persian community, charged $40 for tickets bought in advance, and $45 for tickets bought at the door.  Some who phoned to buy tickets in advance were told that the concert was sold out.

FACT: a generous guess would be that 20 members of the Reed community actually showed up for the concert.  There were roughly two full empty rows in the back of the Chapel.  That means 40 or more people didn&#8217;t use their free admission.

INFERENCE: some members of the Persian community stayed away from the concert because of its supposedly sold-out status.  This represents a significant financial loss to the sponsoring organization, and it deprived people for whom the concert had great cultural and emotional significance of their opportunity to attend.

It&#8217;s not just this particular event—we know that students who pick up free tickets that have been bought by Student Activities for concerts sometimes do not use them.  This behavior wastes the college&#8217;s resources and means that people who would actually attend a concert are not able to do so.  That&#8217;s not fair!

Please, people, if you sign up to attend a performance, or have a free ticket from Student Activities, go to the concert!  If you absolutely cannot, then give your ticket to someone else who _will_ go.
