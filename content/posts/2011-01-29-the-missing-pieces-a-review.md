The Portland Playhouse’s production of Nick Zagone’s _The Missing_ _Pieces_ is a playful, heartfelt tale of a boy’s search for a father figure. The production is not perfect, but director Brian Weaver certainly puts on a damn good show.

When the lights come up, it’s 1980. Mt. St. Helens has just erupted and Portland is covered in ash. Timmy’s brother, Bobby, is home from LA after a failed attempt to break into the music industry. His Irish Catholic mother, Peggy, insists everything is a “shit ass” and spends her nights drinking wine, listening to “You Don’t Bring Me Flowers Anymore,” and pining for her absent husband. As for Timmy himself? Timmy’s got a great big pile of stolen Playboys.

Consumed by the singular desire to move into the Playboy Mansion and live with Hugh Hefner, Timmy reaches out to Miss May 1963, a Portland-based aging beauty named Lillian. As Lillian’s health deteriorates, she becomes increasingly enmeshed in the family, changing it forever.

The story successfully fluctuates between serious and slapstick without feeling disjointed. A tender moment between Lillian and Peggy over drinks, Peggy’s discovery of the stashed Playboys, and the boys’ return home are particularly good examples.
  
Deirdre Atkinson, the actress playing Lillian, is wonderfully cast. Her ability to capture the fragility of her strong, outspoken character makes her performance shine through the whiskey-induced haze and clouds of cigarette smoke with which her character surrounds herself. Atkinson is at her best during the play’s namesake monologue, in which she describes Shel Silverstein’s story “The Missing Piece” to Peggy and explains why she and Timmy need to move on after her husband’s decision to leave them.

Casey McFeron, who plays Bobby, is also a joy to watch. His apathetic, too-cool-for-my-kid-brother attitude plays swimmingly off of Daylen Chipp’s stiff and awkward rendition of Timmy, making the relationship totally believable. (In Chipp’s defense, though, this is his first time acting in a play, so genius is not to be expected; he garners applause if only for being a seventh grader in a, quote-unquote, “real theatre” production.)

Lorraine Bahr’s take on Peggy is solid. At times, she becomes more caricature than character—her Irish accent ladled on liberally—but for the most part her execution is strong. (“Get your shit-ass Rolls Royce out of my driveway!” being one of her standout lines.)

Completing the cast are Val Landrum – a Lucy Moran look-alike
  
who plays Timmy’s father’s girlfriend, Honey – and David Seitz, who plays the owner of the Playboys Timmy steals, a millionaire cult leader, and Mr. Hefner himself. Landrum gives a good performance, but Seitz possesses a strange, frantic energy that made me squirm. It was not until he came on as Hugh Hefner and chilled the fuck out that I could take him seriously.
  
Minor complaints aside, _The Missing Pieces_ is a lot of fun to watch and this reviewer looks forward to seeing what the Portland Playhouse and this ensemble of actors do next.

The Portland Playhouse is located at 602 NE Prescott in Northeast Portland. _The Missing Pieces_ is a part of the Fertile Ground festival and is playing until January 30. More information can be found at <http://www.portlandplayhouse.org/> and <http://www.fertilegroundpdx.org/>.
