When someone mentions Fashion Week, the cities usually associated with the biannual event are New York, Paris, Milan, London, Tokyo, and other large, hyper-metropolitan cities known for producing design houses famous worldwide.

Every fall and spring, the who’s-who of the fashion world don their finest threads and hobnob with celebrities as they watch the upcoming trends strut down the catwalk. And in the real world, people look to Fashion Week for inspiration in adding a little color to their everyday life.

Fashion Week in Portland is relatively new, but most certainly not something to be overlooked. People are attracted to this West Coast city-town for its collection of eclectic and unique individuals, and a fashion show debuting some of the best and brightest of the City of Roses’ up-and-coming talents sounded nothing less than exciting. Just walking down any given street downtown provides a wealth of different styles, some subtle, some dramatic &#8211; and all very fascinating as a collective.

The runway event was located at a warehouse by the docks of Northeast Portland.

It was a very cool affair, where the upper crust of the greater Portland area had gathered for a relaxed, sophisticated event. While it’s true that the crowd at the event were a mixed bag of truly trendy individuals, a number of young females who looked like they were trying entirely too hard, the occasional free-spirited dresser (very true to organic Portland form), and everyday average Janes and Joes, no one seemed to really notice or care. In fact, no one looked stressed out at all &#8211; the mood was one for enjoyment, not tension and frenzy. The DJ spun tunes ranging from Michael Jackson to French hip-hop to Michael Buble, and no one seemed to mind that the show was about 45 minutes behind schedule. The runway, which was made out of solar panels, was the center of a lot of conversations, and instead of having a red carpet for photographs, an extension of the panels was roped off for people to have their pictures taken. Best of all, the photographers weren’t particularly discerning towards who they photographed &#8211; “if you look good, we want your picture!” said one photographer (I declined, though I was flattered).

Though not all collections were wow-worthy, a number deserve acknowledgment:
  
With La Vie by Michelle DeCourcy, the first line, French-inspired casual attire was achieved with horizontally striped shirts, high-waisted shorts, lace accents, and bouffant hairdos. Black, white, and pink were the colors of choice. Expressions were of lighthearted fun, and the tailoring was exquisite. Though not particularly statement-making, it was impressive for being both well-designed and yet thoroughly wearable.

Stephanie D. Couture, while not entirely on the mark, had a number of looks that really stood out. Floor-length gowns made of gauzy fabric featured edgy side slits, even in full skirts, which was unusual but interesting. The dresses looked both sophisticated and comfortable, which had me quietly racking my brain for an excuse to buy one. Luxurious draping of excess fabric took simple cuts to the next level, while all the while maintaining simple elegance and grace.

Isaac Hers was definitely a favorite. Slightly more goth-inspired than the other collections, Issac Hers was edgier and a little more dangerous. Bold reds, oranges, and blacks dominated the color palette, and ‘60s mod cuts were brought into the modern age with unexpected mesh inserts and nods to ‘90s and early ‘00s accents, like leather wristbands and chunky platforms. Zippers and geometric patterns brought the whole vibe together nicely, and definitely got the crowd’s attention.

Though Portland isn’t known for it yet, there is an amazing movement of high-end couture designers coming out to show their stuff. While most budding designers fly off to cities better known for their involvement in the fashion industry, these designers have proven their determination to really put Portland on the map as a place to be reckoned with. Defying expectations, they put out a show that was inspiring.

Some fear this movement towards a more high-end metropolis signifies the impending doom of gentrification. But in reality, there is probably nothing to fear.

The best-dressed man in the room, a twenty-something year old wearing a navy blazer with various pins on the lapel over a tank top and classily cut denim trousers, stood munching on some hors d’oeuvres nearby and chatting with an acquaintance as I was wrapping up to leave. I couldn’t help but overhear their conversation as I made my exit.

“I love that jacket. Who are you wearing?” The young man didn’t miss a beat. “Oh, this? I got it at Goodwill.”

Portland style, through and through.
