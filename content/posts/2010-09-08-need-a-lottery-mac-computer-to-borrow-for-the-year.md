To be eligible for a Lottery Mac you must be either a thesising senior or on financial aid. Also, so that we can make these computers available to those most in need, students who already own a working computer are kindly asked not to apply for the lottery. This program is based on the Honor Principle and intended to help those in need.

Still interested? Youâ€™ll need to complete a Lottery Application Form and turn it into the IRC Help Desk, Computer Hardware Shop (ETC 114) or the Computer Store (ETC 116).
