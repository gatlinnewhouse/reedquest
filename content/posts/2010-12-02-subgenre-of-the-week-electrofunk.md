_We live in an age where our postmodern sensibilities have translated into flourishing musical creativity. This, paired with the death of radio, has led to the creation of nearly every subgenre imaginable. But how do you keep track of them all? Each week (well, most weeks) we here at the Quest do our best to help make sense of all this alternativeness._

Today’s electro subgenres are all pretty closely related to each other, so it’s pretty noteworthy when one stands out from the rest. Electrofunk (also known as “funktronica” or “electro-boogie”) is the ugly duckling in today’s electro family, serving as the awkward, goofy-looking half-brother of house and twice-removed step cousin of dubstep.

Being the avid electronica fan I am, I tend to think of electro subgenres as if they were different girls I’ve dated (Editor’s Note: Andrew Choi has never actually dated a girl). I would imagine dating electrofunk to go something like this: While her appearance is really offputting (“Can’t you have just one drop?” you ask forlornly), you end up giving her a shot. Soon enough, you realize that most of your initial qualms with her are really superficial. In fact, you end up really enjoying your time with electrofunk because she isn’t like the others. Sure, you’ll eventually wind up back with your one true love Justice, but you most certainly found your time with Chromeo to be exponentially more entertaining and interesting than that one date you went on with Rusko.

The bottom line is that despite its marginal success, electrofunk is awkward. The introduction of funk into the ideal-typical electro beat creates something that cannot simply be characterized by “George Clinton hosting a rave.”  Drums don’t have the oophm that you’d typically expect. Funky bass thrown into a synthesizer creates something that is not quite electro, not quite funk, and not unlike the Ghostbusters soundtrack in sonic quality. Another peculiarity of electrofunk is the vocoder and talkbox, frequently used to emulate the pitchy vocals of funk predecessors. In the landscape of electronic music, the electrofunk’s sound seems out of place, if not completely silly.

But, in some sense, these quirks are what allow this little subgenre to come into its own. For one thing, the unique sound of electrofunk is in part to a greater focus on instrumentalism. This immediately sets it apart from the rest of electro, which typically employs sampling and looping. As a result, songs like “Night By Night” can use a guitar solo to precede a hook instead of a looped buildup. Electrofunk bands typically use instruments in their live sets, as well.

Electrofunk seems to be well aware of its place in the family. Much of its tenor and lyrical content shows attitude which matches the sense of silliness embodied the music (see “Call Me Up”). And the family seems to have responded well, too. Search for “Chromeo remixes” in Google, and you’ll find dubstep, house, and even trance reinterpretations of the genre.

Maybe you’ll grow to love electrofunk, too. Check out some of picks below.
