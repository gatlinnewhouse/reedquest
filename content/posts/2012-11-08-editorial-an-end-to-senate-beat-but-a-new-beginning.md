The way _The_ _Quest_ covers the Reed Student Body Senate is changing. Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll still be covering everything newsworthy that happens at Senate. But we won&#8217;t be doing weekly _Senate Beat_ articles. Instead, we&#8217;ll run individual news stories on each particular thing that Senate does.

The editorial board feels it is no longer useful to aggregate all of each week&#8217;s Senate stories into one article simply because they all happen in the same week at Senate. We have decided it does not make sense to lump stories about disparate topics together under a single headline. We&#8217;ll still bring you coverage on all the important issues; they&#8217;ll just each have their own separate, in-depth story. We&#8217;ll also be uploading these stories online, like most of our stories, as we have them ready, instead of waiting until they come out in print.

To help you navigate what Senate has been up to, we&#8217;ll be running a short rundown of each week&#8217;s Senate-related stories, likely on page two. (Dean of Student Services Mike Brody suggested the name “Senate Beat-Box” for this feature.)

Finally, to supplement our individual coverage of each story, we&#8217;ll also be running a weekly op-ed column/blog on our website – and sometimes in print – that will look more like the old model of _Senate Beat,_ with the exception that it will not longer be the main source of coverage for each week&#8217;s main stories. This will either be written by a former Senator or by a different current Senator each week.
