I suck at choosing favorites. I’m one of those assholes who has, like, 30 “favorite” bands and untold millions of “favorite” Arrested Development lines, probably because I am too CHICKEN to pick favorite.

However, if I had to pick my favorite bar in Portland thus far, it would have to be the Reel ‘m’ Inn, hands down. There are four very important reasons why the Reel ‘m’ Inn is the shit: STRONG, CHEAP drinks and good beer variety (both draught and bottle); Mama Gina, the best bartender ever; a good soundtrack; and fried chicken & jo-jos.

All right, I’ma have to food-nerd-out about the chicken for a minute, because it is so, so, so good. I’m not certain, but I think they must soak it in salted buttermilk and fry it in lard, because to the best of my knowledge, that’s how fried chicken of that caliber gets made. It is pretty much perfect and always worth the 20-30 minute wait &#8211; they make it to order. The skin is delicious and crispy, the meat tender and juicy and just the tiniest bit greasy. You can get any cut you want &#8211; even an order of fried gizzards, YUM &#8211; and most orders come with jo-jos, which are just hunormous french fries. Plus, you get a six-pack of sauces with your chicken & jos: Buffalo wing sauce, Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce, honey mustard, hot mustard, BBQ sauce, and ketchup.

My point being: good God, the chicken is tasty.

There are other reasons to come here though, a crucial one being Mama Gina, the best bartender/human being ever. I asked her for a double whiskey on the rocks and she presented me with a pint glass full of ice and whiskey; later, she led the bar in a rousing, yell-y rendition of “Don’t Stop Believin’.” She completely disregards the fill line on shot glasses and knows all the words to every song that plays.

On Saturday we heard a lot of Sublime, that “Spirit in the Sky” song, some Beatles, Journey&#8230;it’s an eclectic mix of nothing you’ve never heard of before, which is just how I like it. Oh, also, they frequently play Food Network on the bar TVs. <3
  
Recap: the chicken is amazing, there’s a ton of booze to be had, it’s comfortingly un-hip, and Mama Gina is my personal hero. But you know the best thing about this place? It’s cheap as balls! My tab on Saturday night came to $22.50: I’d had a greyhound, a “double whiskey on the rocks,” a tequila shot, a single whiskey, and three chicken thighs with four jos. (Needless to say, I was not the DD.)

Bottom line: come here, eat chicken, get drunk, spend minimal amounts of scrilla &#8211; but don’t try to say the music sucks, because if you think it does, then you do.

Newton out!
