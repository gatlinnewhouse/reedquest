Lena Lencek, Professor of Russian and Humanities, says that she’s been drawing and painting since she was born. Her first show was held in a gallery in Portland in the Early 80’s. Since then, she’s also illustrated a children’s book, and whenever she travels, her sketchbook is her travel diary. It’s always been something she’s done on the side. Says Lencek, “It’s a way of being present… of seeing the world… a form of meditation.”

Lencek’s show, _GEOCHROMES: The Spirit of Place in Line and Color,_ is being displayed in the Vollum College Center Gallery April 3through June 15. The works were created between 2011 and 2013, while Lencek was created while on sabbatical in Italy. Additionally, some were painted in the Southwest United States, Baja California, and the Oregon coast.

While living in San Gimignano in Tuscany, Lencek was working on a translation of Pavel Pavlovich Muratov’s “Images of Italy,” a history of Italian art during the Rennaisance, located in the Berenson Library outside of Florence. Mysteriously, a copy of the book found its way – unaided by Lencek – into Reed’s rare book library.

The light of Tuscany inspired her to create these pieces. Lencek described the light as “magical” and that one cannot help but become “and idolater of the light.” In addition, she was reading and translating someone else’s reaction to artwork, and the verbal picture Muratov was creating catalyzed her desire to capture the beauty around her. “The land [of Italy] is so layered, expressive and fluid,” says Lencek, that it is the perfect “receptacle of light.”

However, Lencek describes her art best when she says, “I sketch on the road, the air, and the sea because only when I look with my pen and brush do I catch and fix the fleeting conjunction between the timeless geography of land and my moment and the memories to come.”
