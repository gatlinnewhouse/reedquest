While many Reedies hold some pride in their un-athleticism, some desire the presence of physical activity in their lives. Sydney Scarlata is one of them. Having swam and played soccer all throughout high school, freshman Sydney Scarlata was “burnt out” from varsity sports, and saw Reed as a respite from the intense competition of her high school’s team. However, “by the end of first semester I realized I just really missed soccer,” she said. Starting this year, Scarlatta, along with others, have garnered interest for the new Women’s Soccer Club that will be an official PE class next autumn.

Assistant Director of Student Activities and Women’s Soccer Coach Ramiro Espinoza said Scarlata was a main force behind the creation of the team. “It’s all her fault,” he said, jokingly. But Sydney admits it wasn’t just her. She said, “the first step was figuring out if people were interested.” After a couple of false starts, this year the team finally began to gain momentum. In last semester’s Funding Poll, Women’s Soccer was the top funded sports team. Scarlata says that many people found out about the club from Funding Poll. “It was a really hopeful sign when we had 27 people on the email list,” she said. Now, the team has around 15 committed players, although the exact number fluctuates between practices and games.

Espinoza says, “we have a variety of players. We have people who play competitively and people who haven’t been playing since they we’re in kindergarten.” Doucette says, “I think there is this notion that Reedies are just not interested in sports or anything athletic because you can’t be both a nerd and a jock, but as a life-time lover of soccer and Star Wars, I can tell you that this is not true.”

There are currently six teams in the division that the “Griffins” play against, however most players are older than the Reedies. The team is also so large that it needs to be broken into two teams for the Futsal league. Scarlata hopes that soon the women’s team will join the men’s soccer team in the Cascade Collegiate Soccer League, playing with teams from Willamette, Lewis & Clarke, and the University of Oregon. “We’re going to have an official gym class next fall,” she says. Although not on the 2013-2014 course list as of the editing of this article, it will be available. According to Espinoza, over the summer interviews will be conducted to determine who will coach the class next fall.

Those interested in the logistics of gaining college support for a team are encouraged to email him at lombardm AT reed DOT edu. For more information on starting a sports club, Lombardo suggests reading the Reed College Club Sport Handbook on the [Reed PE website][2] for a list of policies and procedures pertaining to Club Sports.
