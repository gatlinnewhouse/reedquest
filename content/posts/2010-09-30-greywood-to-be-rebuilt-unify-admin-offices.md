The Greywood building, which now houses Career Services and Alumni Services, will be closed come Winter Break.

The proposel, which is to be approved by the Board of Trustees at their October meeting, plans for the new building to house academic support services, the language lab, bike storage, and a staff lounge in the basement. The Admissions Office will move to the first floor of the building. New classrooms and faculty offices will be on the second and third floors, as well as a lounge and a student “gallery-lounge” area on the third floor.

“There’s an obvious metaphor of [the building] serving as the front door and the back door,” says Ron Albertson, Director of Career Services. “I am delighted that Career Services will be housed at the main entrance to Reed and remain close to the heart of the campus, the library.”

Keith Todd, Dean of Admissions, is equally enthused about the move. In a recent interview, he spoke excitedly about the possibility of integrating the various departments of the admissions process into a single body. The new building layout, he says, will aid in “inform[ing]…and helping [both prospective and current students] where they need [it most].”

Despite the positive change the new plan will bring, however, it raises questions of the future of the Performing Arts Center.

“In theory, this project should not have an impact on the Performing Arts Center,” assures Ed McFarlane, head of the building committee, “because it has been the understanding that the performing arts building would be funded through gifts.

So if we are successful in raising [adequate funds] for the performing arts building, we will, I assume, construct it.”

It is this “in theory” attitude that has people worried. The plans for the construction of a new center have already been delayed multiple times, and a recent faculty meeting raised concerns that the Greywood changes will postpone plans for a new Performing Arts Center even longer. However, the cost estimate for the Greywood building, which will be approved this weekend, will be more telling of the possibilities in store for these plans. The Greywood project is to be completed by the summer of 2012 is slated to open by the start of Fall Semester 2012.

Though it is still undecided which classes will be held in the classrooms and which professors will be receiving the new faculty offices, it is apparent that Reed’s integration of the various offices into a single body is meant to highlight efforts toward developing a more centralized and unified campus.
