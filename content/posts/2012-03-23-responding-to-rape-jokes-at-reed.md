Before spring break, a few Reedies gathered at the MRC for a brainstorming session that I co-facilitated along with Jyl Shaffer, Assistant Dean for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, about how to respond to rape jokes on campus. We decided to follow up on that discussion in The Quest for two reasons. First, we want everyone to have the tools they need to respond to jokes that make light of sexual violence, and in ways that create positive change. Second, we found that anticipating some of the conversations that could happen around this issue made for a good mental exercise in the Honor Principle. Below you’ll find the core questions that shaped our discussion, and a recap of how we went about addressing them. It is my hope that a few minutes spent thinking through these strategies will contribute to productive conversations around campus, in response to rape jokes and otherwise.

**What if you’re short on time or energy?** – Not every rape joke warrants a lecture, and in some situations that degree of confrontation is impossible. Ideally, asking someone to not repeat something that was offensive would be the end of it, but usually some explanation is in order. This may be what prevents people who aren’t especially engaged with an issue from speaking up about it, but some response is almost always better than silence. Small acts are important.

**How can you separate impact from intent?** – When someone makes an offensive joke, they almost certainly meant for what they said to be taken lightly. If you confront someone’s rape joke, the person might get defensive, blame you for being offended, or minimize the joke. It could be helpful to anticipate this and speak from a first-person perspective initially, emphasizing that you were negatively impacted regardless of the other person’s intentions.

**To shame or not to shame?** – Shaming someone for making a rape joke takes the focus away from the joke and puts it on the person, which is not the way to start a constructive dialogue. Anyone—even nice people and feminists—can make a harmful joke, and there are ways to focus on what was harmful in the joke without alienating the person who made it. Humor, personal experiences, and facts can be used to make a point that doesn’t equate bad joke with bad person.

**When is passive aggression okay?** – Passive-aggressive responses can be useful depending on the situation, the energy of the responder, and his or her need for self-care, but they can also reinforce negative stereotypes. It might be effective to point out how “funny” a joke made at the expense of survivors of sexual assault would be if it featured the person who said it. However, responses like this may or may not strike the right tone, which is something to consider.
