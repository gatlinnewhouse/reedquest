Two minutes after the official start time of their game, Reed FC ran onto the soccer field. Then they ran back to the bleachers. They followed that up with some stretching.

Fifteen minutes later, enough random Reedies were assembled to form an opposing team. Saturday’s preseason friendly was foiled when the opposing team, Mount Angel Seminary, canceled twenty-six hours before the game. But they kept a jovial disposition in the face of disappointment. Jon, #20, thanked his fans for their support, with the caveat that “winning is the only thing that matters.” The lack of opposition didn’t diminish the energy of the game.

Since the opposing team didn’t show, Reed FC played a team made up of extras and spectators.  The spectators lounged on a couch drinking beer and praising the virtues of hydration for spectators. They cheered with inspiring, booze-fueled commentary such as “soccer harder!”  and “what is this, an ice cream social? Get in the game!”  Confused spectators shouted “rugby harder!” or occasionally “too much rugby!”  Too much rugby indeed, as #3 was blatantly shoved in an effort to gain possession of the ball. When asked how he felt about this small breach of etiquette he said “not too bad, he’s a rugby player so I understood.”

At halftime the Reed FC goalie bled heavily from the knee as the team shared constructive criticism. They regrouped, shouting “Reed FC, FSU!” and ended the game with the tie, 2-2. The team dynamic was strong, largely in anticipation of food, but also out of confidence in their athletic prowess.
