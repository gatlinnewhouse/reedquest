_Welcome to_ The Sound Attendance:** __**_Crackerjack reviews of new releases covering bands fated to self-inflicted obscurity, to saccharine mainstream indie darlings, to Portland core (Reed core are you there??). Concert and haunted-house reviews are likely to be finagled when opportunity strikes, as are reviews of band websites and special releases. Know a local band you think I should review?

**Magic Trick**: _Ruler of the Night_ LP: Hardly Art [CHAMBER POP]

For Fans of:  Sonny & the Sunsets, Wilco, Bill Calahan.

The songs on San Francisco band Magic Trick’s June release of _Ruler of the Night_ sheath pop formulas in spare, sinister harmonies that sound like eulogies to real pop songs. The album is Magic Trick’s first with tiny Seattle Subpop sweetheart label Hardly Art, which also boasts hairdresser-blues Hunx (and His Punx) and other dyed in the wool San Francisco darlings. But unlike many of the Bay’s sunloving mischief-makers, Lyricist Tim Cohen, of the Fresh and Onlys, gravitates towards sleepy dreamscapes of the American West, supplemented by action figures of Kings and Queens, and baroque angels wedded to tumbleweed fortresses. _Ruler of the Night_ swirls in insightful, lamentations that would be great breakup songs if there is such a thing, or might bode collectively as a becoming alternative album to sad, whimsical, _Where the Wild Things Are_ soundtrack. Gold nuggets are found in “Torture” with sentimental lyrics like, “I’m going to the gallows in my mind” a song about unquenched appetites, or the woebegone, “Weird Memory,” where Cohen asks an old lover; “Can it be/ that I’m just a weird memory that never happened?” Cohen manages to sound dejected but somehow still cute and comforting.

**Wet Hair:** _Spill into Atmosphere_: De Stijl [SYNTH TAPE MUSIC]

For Fans of: Califone, Broken Social Scene, CAKE.

Wet Hair relies on the gymnastic use of modern machines to mix the fringe of 60s psychedelic rock with a slur of echoes and shoegazey vocals to brew joyous but non-overwhelming music. The Iowa City band’s junior release from the Minneapolis label settles into pipey synths made-video-gamey by stock UFO sound effects and consummated by a cloud of frontman Shawn Reed’s cocky, distorted vocals. Reed’s voice alone makes him sound like the perfect person to run away with in a Volkswagen and fawn over tarot cards. No less, Reed is responsible for the collaged cover art of the band, which matches the posturing of its sound. “Strange Romance” and “Blank Sunday” take the album to its points of zenith, managing to be both creepy and hair band anthem-worthy. Also download their 2011 release, _In Vogue Spirit_ for a spacier and less daisy-be-scattered blend of sounds.
