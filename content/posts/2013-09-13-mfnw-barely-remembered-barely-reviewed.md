Musicfest NW has the well-earned reputation for being Portland’s resident music festival, the only event truly worthy of PDX’s music-heavy culture. Around Reed, it has a somewhat different reputation: that thing with the bands that you want to see but you can’t because it’s the fucking first week of classes and you have to read Dante’s Inferno for Hum 210 and you don’t have the goddamn time for this shit. Well, never fear, all you beleaguered upperclassmen already drowning in work and wide-eyed freshmen too daunted by the bus system to venture out to find the Wonder Ballroom or the Roseland Theatre (But seriously, it’s impossible to get to the Wonder), someone went out into the world and saw those concerts for you. That’s right, yours truly shook off the responsibilities of classes, extracurriculars, and even basic human functions to bring you to the front lines of the best shows of MFNW.
  
Wednesday

Deerhunter w/Lonnie Holly @ Crystal Ballroom

Bradford Cox, weirdo lead singer and bandleader of Deerhunter, has a reputation for being caustic, unstable, and fantastically weird in concert. While he did cut a rather odd figure, his reputation overshadowed the performance, where he barely said anything between songs. C’mon! I didn’t come to this to listen to music, I want to hear some weirdo rants! About halfway through the show, word spread that James Mercer, lead singer of that awful band the Shins (of “THEY’LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE” a la Natalie Portman fame) was hanging out in the VIP section. Knowing that this may be my only chance to start a fight with this loser (ask my friends, they can tell you of my inexplicable vitriolic hatred for the fuckin’ Shins), I tried to smoothly slide my way into the balcony. I failed. Oh well, the end of the show was pretty tight, with Cox leading a twenty minute free-noise odyssey. It was cool.

Thursday

Bonnie “Prince” Billy w/Mount Eerie @ Aladdin Theatre

After angrily trying to get into Dante’s to rep some Reed pride at the Hausu show, and subsequently getting tossed to the curb by who I can only assume is Jesse Ventura’s body double, I decided to bring the rage to Aladdin Theater for the first show of Billy’s two-night MFNW stay. After quickly finding the crowd non-responsive to my attempts at moshing, I retreated to the balcony to enjoy this delightful and emotional show. Mount Eerie was a bit urbane, in the way that every song sounded the same and was about nature somehow (which provided my friend a good opportunity to do his Soc readings), but Bonnie “Prince” Billy was engaging in nearly every way. His stage banter was funnier than most stand up routines, and I don’t know anyone else that could make a story about how he murdered his grandma so goddamn hilarious.

Friday

Titus Andronicus w/Naomi Punk @ Crystal Ballroom

I love Titus. They are one of the first bands I have ever truly loved. When The Monitor dropped, it blew 10<sup>th</sup> Grade Charlie’s mind. That being said, Titus Andronicus is the first band that has ever giving me that unique feeling of disappointment that occurs when, during a concert, the lead singer announces that they will now be playing some new songs, and I’m all like “Oh nooooooooooo”. That being said, I will always be ready to scream “YOU WILL ALWAYS BE A LOSER” in some moshing meathead’s face. Always.

Saturday

Godspeed You! Black Emperor w/Earth @ Roseland Theater

Imagine staring over a post-apocalyptic wasteland, restraining a tear from your visage, as you see everything you once knew and loved being eviscerated and crumbling apart before your very eyes, as a solar windstorm whistles overhead and tectonic plates crash together in a disparate symphony of cataclysm and crushing depression. Imagine a bearded, overweight man, attempting to restrain a tear from his pockmarked visage, who fondly remembers a time when talking to girls wasn’t so hard, and who now spends his time curating a perfect collection of black t-shirts for the bands he loves and hopes will cause people to approach him, who will eagerly tell you about the time he saw Godspeed the first time around, back before the turn of the millennium, when they were just playing _F# A#_ **_∞_** for the first time. Both of these images are perfectly accurate for this show.

Sunday

Neko Case @ Pioneer Courthouse Square

This show was pretty alright. I like to imagine that Neko went straight from this show to Voodoo Donuts, where she promptly ordered an Ol’ Dirty Bastard, because my girl Neko knows how to treat herself. I suppose if you actually want me to voice a legitimate criticism of this concert, I would say that the outdoor atmosphere and the elevated stage at the Square provides for a pretty disengaging experience. That, however, is more of a concern for outdoor festival stages in general. Neko Case and her band did a perfectly fine show, if perhaps a bit too milquetoast, with the setting. But who cares about the show when I can fantasize about sharing a tasty, gooey donut with the gorgeous, hilarious Neko Case. On second thought, who gives a shit about music, I just want that donut.
