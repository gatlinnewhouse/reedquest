Last Thursday, a huge, colorful, and energetic crowd marched through Portland’s streets before settling down to indefinitely occupy a two-block park downtown. Inspired by the ongoing Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City, the Occupy Portland protest shared many things with its progenitor: occupation of a public space, “horizontal” rather than hierarchical organization, and populist criticisms of corporate power and wealth inequality.  _The Oregonian_ stated that the march counted at least 4,000 people, while others present said the crowd included as many as 8,000 or 10,000 people.  Since then, several hundred people have continued to occupy Lownsdale and Chapman squares downtown.  Two reporters from _The Quest_ followed Thursday’s protest march and stayed for the beginning of the occupation.  Many other Reedies were also in attendance.

Periodically, spontaneous and wordless cheers travelled through the immense crowd like a wave.  At other times, they chanted vigorously: “We are the 99%,” “We got sold out; banks got bailed out,” “How to fix the deficit? End the war, tax the rich!”  People of all ages and all backgrounds were present.  Bill Harris, a Portlander with a trimmed white beard who has been at protests for 50 years, remarked that “there are a lot of people here under 30.”  There were union members, environmentalists, libertarian Ron Paul supporters, pro-Palestinian activists, bandana-covered anarchists, and Unitarian Universalists, among many others.  They carried American flags, Cascadian flags, and anarchist black flags.

The protesters carried signs ranging from the straightforward (“Congress is a coporatist brothel”) to the clever (“Tired of this eCONomy”), and from the factual (“From 1980 to 2005, more than 80% of the total increase in Americans&#8217; income went to the top 1%&#8221;) to the whimsical (“Eat the rich”).  Others carried signs for a large list of other causes.  One man with a rainbow ski mask carried a sign stating, simply, “Fuck plastic.”  Another, with a tri-cornered hat and patriotic cravat, protested corporate personhood.

Although the diversity of the protesters was striking, they seemed to share certain common beliefs and concerns.  Many signs focused on corporate power and corporate greed.  Wanda, a younger adult from Tualitin, asserted that current economic problems stemmed from “the inappropriate combination of the corporate interest and governments.”  Bad economic conditions had affected her directly: She had $80,000 in student loan debt from two bachelor’s degrees.  Marcy Westerling , 52 years old, had a worse story: She was terminally ill and had been wait-listed for chemotherapy.  Drug companies had stopped producing the drugs she needed for the Stage IV cancer in her lungs and abdomen because the drugs were not profitable enough.

Although the Occupy Wall Street protests have been criticized for lacking concrete demands, the protesters in Portland seemed content with more general goals.  73-year-old Curtis Bell stated that the protesters were “united around this idea of the system being broken” and that building a “mass movement” meant that people should not be excluded, no matter what their specific complaint was.

However, some remain unconvinced that this is enough. “I don&#8217;t really know what impact it&#8217;s going to have,” says Gabe Andreen ‘14. “I&#8217;m not sure how well it&#8217;s going to be listened to&#8230;which is not to say it&#8217;s not important.

The protesters gathered at noon at Tom McCall Waterfront Park, then marched west on Burnside Street starting at 2:30 and turned south on Broadway.  One of our reporters had to exit her bus early because the protesters were blocking the route, but the other bus riders seemed not to mind.  The protesters then crowded into Pioneer Courthouse Square, where the organizers spoke briefly and let other people speak.

There was no friction observed or reported between protesters and the Portland police, who stayed behind and to either side of the march, many on bicycles.  After Pioneer Courthouse Square, the march continued south on Broadway, before circling back to Lownsdale and Chapman squares, which were chosen as the site to occupy.

Some protesters volunteering for “safety” wore blue armbands and directed the marchers.  One of these volunteers was Fergus Pike, who explained the informal nature of the protest’s organization: “The leadership structure is people can only speak for themselves. . . . It’s true democracy.”

Many of those present held the hope that Thursday’s protest would only mark the beginning of a sustained movement.  One sign read, “The beginning is near.”  Pike said that “this [protest] has a better chance of taking root, the seed growing . . . because dire times lead to dire measures.”

Some people began to leave at around 5 p.m. while some others began to set up camp.  A light, misty rain fell, and a line had formed for free food from Food Not Bombs by 5:15.

More recently, _The Oregonian_ has reported that “hundreds of people have remained in tents” at Chapman and Lownsdale squares, although they temporarily vacated Lownsdale for the Portland Marathon on Sunday.  It seems that these protesters are in for the long haul.
