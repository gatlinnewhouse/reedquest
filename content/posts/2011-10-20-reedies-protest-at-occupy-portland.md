In a gesture of solidarity with Occupy Wall Street and with the Portland community, Reedies found the time to attend Occupy Portland last Thursday. _Quest_ reporters encountered about fifteen of them.

To these Reedies, taking time out of their busy schedules was worth being a part of the movement, even if there were no clear objectives. “I think it’s really amazing that there is no one specific cause; it’s just all about grievances in general,” said Kipper Deutsch ‘14.

Sam Smith ’13 agreed, stating, “I don’t think that there needs to be a concrete reason. This is the organic result of a history of repression.”

But is the movement sustainable? Genevieve Goffman ‘14 thinks so. “This seems a little different to me than other movements that just start up and end,” she said.
