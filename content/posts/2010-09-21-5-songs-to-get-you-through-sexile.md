At some point in your college career, you’re sure to get sexiled. Instead of taking it lying down (I’m sure there’s a lame pun in there somewhere), you should definitely use this playlist to turn what could be a miserable experience into a wonderful opportunity to make your roommate and whomever they’re bangin’ to feel just as awkward as you do. Some of these songs will make them realize the pain you’re feeling, some of them will just make them feel awkward. The bottom line is this: if the walls are thin enough for you to hear them opening their third condom wrapper, they’re definitely thin enough for them to hear you blasting these songs.

**“Dancing With Myself” – Billy Idol**
  
While your roommate and his/her boyfriend/girlfriend/drunken one-night stand are gettin’ it on and interrupting your study time/nap/Grey’s Anatomy marathon with their moans of ecstasy/turn-by-turn directions to their g-spots/pelvis-on-pelvis slapping noises, let Billy Idol remind them that you are trapped in your room, sad and alone, dancing by yourself.

**“Pregnant” – R. Kelly**
  
I’m going to let the lyrics speak for themselves on this one: “Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant/Lay your body down and get you pregnant/ Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up.” Or this gem, “Never felt nothing like this/She’s more than a mistress, enough to handle my business/Gonna put that girl in my kitchen.” And who could forget: “We can pop champagne and get right down to sexing/Now I ain’t got nothing to do tonight. I gotta wait for my crew/I just wanna put some in you/And I can tell that you want it too”?

**“Angel” – Sarah McLachlan**
  
If the dulcet tones of Trey Songz, Enrique Iglesias, or Jeremih wafting through the walls get to be annoying, you should battle back with this glorious song from the patron saint of the ASPCA, Sara McLachlan. If you can find a way to project that heartbreaking commercial with the battered animals and Miss McLachlan begging you to donate money to save the animals into your roommate’s boudoir, even better.

**“Piss on You” – Dave Chappelle**
  
What could possibly be better than R. Kelly singing about knocking gurlz up to kill the mood? Dave Chappelle making fun of R. Kelly by singing about peeing on gurlz.

**“I Touch Myself” – The Divinyls**
  
Finally, if a gentle reminder from Billy Idol that you’re in your room alone, a sexy reminder from R. Kelly that they’re potential makin’ babies, a depressing reminder from Sara McLachlan that THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS DIE EVERY SINGLE DAY AND THEY’RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO STOP IT, and a funny if somewhat disgusting reminder from Dave Chappelle that he’s going to piss on them aren’t enough to get your roommate and their squeeze to stop, do what Samantha Jones did in that one episode of Sex and the City and if you can’t join ‘em, beat it. And be sure to play this song loudly enough that they know exactly what you’re doing.
