On December 28<sup>th</sup>, a man entered the Reed College Bookstore with a briefcase, which he apparently used to steal over a thousand dollars worth of textbooks. The act was caught on camera, and the suspect’s picture was turned over to the Portland police. The same individual returned to the bookstore on January 4<sup>th</sup> for unknown reasons and was noticed by bookstore manager Ueli Stauder, who followed him to an area behind the GCCs where he was approached by Community Safety Officers. During their conversation, the man told them his real name and date of birth. When one of the Community Safety Officers left to meet arriving police and direct them to the spot to make an arrest, the suspect ran into the bushes and escaped.

Although he was not caught, it is likely that this man will eventually end up in jail, according to Community Safety Director Gary Granger. “He committed a felony theft,” said Granger. “Since we have his name, eventually he&#8217;ll get caught at a traffic stop or something, and they&#8217;ll get him on an outstanding warrant.” Add to this that the suspect has been in jail recently, and it makes it even more likely, statistically, that he will be returning. Granger, however, declined to release the suspect’s name, noting that “he has not been convicted, or even formally charged with a crime.”

This episode highlights the continued problem of costly thefts from the Reed College bookstore. These thefts mean higher prices for students: according to Bookstore Manager Ueli Stauder, “Over the last years, we have needed to build an extra $18,000 to $24,000 into our retail price calculation in order to compensate theft.”

Thefts at the bookstore this year are considerably higher than they have been in previous years, especially in the area of textbooks. Overall bookstore thefts were $18,000 in the 2010-2011 fiscal year, a drop from the previous years. This year, thefts have skyrocketed. Over $8000 dollars in textbooks alone has been stolen since June of 2011, whereas in the whole of the 2010-2011 fiscal year, only $4800 of textbooks was stolen. Stauder noted that thefts have been high at other bookstores in the area, which may be due to economic conditions in Oregon.

However, there is a silver lining to this theft – it proves the usefulness of the bookstore&#8217;s cameras. According to Stauder, even though the bookstore cameras didn&#8217;t stop the suspect from leaving with the books the first time, they deterred future theft. “[The cameras] helped us prevent the second theft and, even though he eventually got away, the fact that we temporarily detained him will most likely deter him from coming back to Reed to steal more.” However, since the cameras were only installed six weeks ago, Stauder said it was too soon to see if the cameras will cause a significant decrease in thefts.
