_with Dana Loutey_

The predatory tunicate (_megalodicopia hians_) sits anchored to the seafloor with its charming 13cm jaw wide open, awaiting zooplankton and your love. Havenâ€™t you a heart? Also, it is a hermaphrodite. And now, a question: If you were transported to an alternative universe in which one of these creatures was attached to every human body, but all other circumstances of life remained the same, where would you want your hermaphrodite appendix to be located on your person? Choose wisely.
