_Is_ CSO-in-Chief Gary Granger out to terminate the Honor Principle?

“Why would I be the terminator?” asks Granger, looking quizzically at a satirical leaflet hung up on his wall.

The leaflet in question, which states that Gary Granger is “a cyborg assassin sent back in time to terminate the Honor Principle,” has been circulating around campus since the beginning of last week. It has been widely speculated that the leaflets were a direct result of the increase in Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy (AOD) violations issued by community safety during the past week.

“The Honor Principle presupposes voluntary compliance with established rules, regulations, and policies,” says Granger. “That is from the Preamble to the Honor Principle; it isn’t something that I made up.”

The Preamble to the Honor Principle, along with the leaflet, are currently hung up next to Granger’s map, which details bike thefts and AOD violations on campus. They join other artifacts of community safety’s new approach to enforcing Reed’s AOD policy: a poster depicting Granger holding a blunt and a CSO ‘counter-citation.’ Despite the implications of these posters and leaflets, Granger says that he cannot help but laugh at them.

“I don’t take it personally,” said Granger. “It’s not ‘my’ policy. It is the policy set by the Dean [of Student Services, Mike Brody], President Diver, and the trustees, and that Community Safety agreed to enforce. I don’t make the policy – I find ways to execute it.”

Granger acknowledges that such a policy has resulted in a different approach to the AOD policy on behalf of community safety, and cites the “increased level of vigilance” of his team in handling drug and alcohol-related issues on campus. In October, Granger drafted and released new rules of engagement for alcohol.

However, Granger is also quick to note that nothing has changed in his approach since his arrival in late August. He describes the number of AOD violations last week, 17, to be due in part to increased patrolling, which was the result of a dorm intrusion on January 22 and a burglary in the Physics building on January 28.

“We had patrol priority in certain areas as a result of these events,” Granger noted. “And we were in dorms a lot more to check locks and make sure that everything was secure.” 

Granger said that an increase in patrolling, alongside the recreational time permitted by Paideia week, allowed community safety to identify “problematic” areas on campus and adjust their strategy accordingly.

As a result of this and the new policy spearheaded by Community Safety, Granger expects a “substantial increase” in AOD citations from last year’s week of Paideia.

“In the past, there seemed to be some kind of ‘tacit understanding’ when a CSO encountered a student violating the AOD policy,” Granger explained. “[A CSO] would perhaps see someone [with an illicit substance] and say, ‘hey, you shouldn’t have that out, and when I come back, I shouldn’t see it out.’ Now our approach is such that if we see you doing something that you shouldn’t be doing, we will confront you about it.”

Despite what appears to backlash on behalf of some members of Reed community, Granger insists that it is unsubstantial and that he will continue what he believes to be a consistent approach to enforcing the AOD policy on campus.

“I would be worried,” Granger said, “if the community as a whole stood up and told me that our approach violated the Honor Principle. But right now, it seems like this is coming from a small number of people who are not willing to have a dialogue.”
