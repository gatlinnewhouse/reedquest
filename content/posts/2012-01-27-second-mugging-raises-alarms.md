On December 7<sup>th</sup>, a second mugging at gunpoint occurred on the Reed Campus. A student and her mother, while entering the Reed campus near the Prexy parking lot, were robbed at gunpoint by two men. The robbers took a cell phone, a purse, a small amount of cash, as well as credit cards. Much like the first robbery, the suspects are unlikely to be caught. And much like the last robbery, the police have nothing substantial to go on.

Director of Community Safety Gary Granger hypothesizes that the robbers are the same people responsible for the robbery on November 16<sup>th</sup>, but this is an educated guess. “Criminals tend to find a spot where they can rob people and return until they feel it’s unsafe to go back.”

Since two armed robberies have occurred within less than 30 days, Reed is stepping up its response. Most importantly, the college will be hiring a private security contractor, Pacific Patrol Services, to patrol campus seven days a week from 8 PM until 2 AM. CSOs will be doing less lockups at high risk times in order to spend more time patrolling, and Community Safety is exploring the possibility of putting more lights on campus. No new community safety officers will be hired, but the grounds crew is trimming back the landscaping at Reed to give fewer places for potential criminals to hide. Portland Police may be driving through parking lots on patrol, but will not be going any further onto campus unless called.

However, Granger noted that the hiring of Pacific Patrol Services was a “stopgap” measure that he hoped to replace with the return of Student Patrol Officers in Fall 2012. Student Patrol Officers were a fixture at Reed for a long time, until the program died out about five years ago. Student Patrol Officers sometimes went on to be Community Safety Officers after graduation, such as CSO Dhyana Carbaga and former CSO Rose Simms. These students, according to Granger, would be responsible for providing extra support at events, doing unlocks, and observing the campus. They would not be, in the words of Granger, “chasing bad guys” and would most likely not respond to medical calls, although they would probably be trained in First Aid and CPR-certified. They would also be Position Personnel Security Status (PPSST) certified, which means they would need to take a test and have a background check.

Despite the added security, Granger still advises students to be safety conscious. “Take the lighter path, walk and groups, and if you see something suspicious, call the CSOs,” said Granger.
