What would you do if you had $25,000? Lori Rodriguez ’13, Maya Scherr-Willson ’13, Lillian Karabaic ’13, and Cole Perkinson ’13 each had elaborate plans, but ultimately, only one of them would get funding.

Karabaic, Scherr-Willson, Rodriguez, and Perkinson were Reed’s four nominees for the Watson Fellowship. The Watson Fellowship provides a stipend of $25,000 to forty fellows selected from forty participating liberal arts colleges. Each college nominates four seniors in a highly competitive internal selection process. The forty fellows get to use the stipend to pursue an independent study concerning something they are passionate about in a country other than that of their home country. Reed’s Watson winner—Perkinson—was announced Friday, March 15.

Perkinson has been playing Zimbabwean music with his family for around eleven years. He will spend the next year playing music in Africa. “My primary goal would be to play music and travel with different bands and groups to learn about the different forms of music that is currently being produced in Africa.” Perkinson plans to go to five different countries: Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Ghana and spend two to three months in each country. The first half of his time in each country would be spent “working with traditional musicians and the second half traveling with more modern groups.” However, Perkinson doesn’t need to go to all the way to Africa to get some exposure to the music. “I play in a couple different marimba bands in Portland and have met a lot of Zimbabwean musicians and learned a lot while working one and one with them. I want to be a performer and this trip gives me an opportunity to transform as a person. That’s what’s exciting for me about this project.”

Karabaic is interested in cycling and public transportation, and aimed to look at how the infrastructure for this in other countries is set up. She hopes to “going to seventeen countries in fourteen months, cycling through all of the European countries, taking trains in Asia, flying to Australia and Canada and then again cycling once I arrive there.” She has been planning the trip for about five years and wants “to do the trip regardless of the fellowship, however if I don’t receive the fellowship I may not get to visit all of the countries.” In addition, Karabaic wants to meet with transportation authorities and policy experts in the various countries. “I want to know how to get people who have money for cars to get out of them.” She plans on wearing a Victorian riding costume, which her friend is sewing for her, for the duration of the trip.

Scherr-Willson wanted to examine chronic kidney disease of unknown cause that is prevalent in Costa Rica, Central America, and Sri-Lanka amongst sugar cane and rice paddy workers. “I’m mostly interested in how people are perceiving the illness. It encapsulates a lot of other issues, particularly the issue of labor, in that is has to be medicalized to be important to the rest of the world.” She says that she is looking also into “back-up options.” “I’m not pursuing other funding ideas for it right now, but it’s important to me. The reason the Watson’s exciting is because it is independent. If things are working out the way you had planned you are in a position to change that and rework your project.”

Rodriguez says she hopes to first “go volunteer at an NGO in Guatemala called Mayapedal that takes old bikes and repairs them or makes them into bicimaquinas.” Bicimacquinas are, “re-purposed bikes that are modified to fill a non-bike purpose. For example, Mayapedal has made things as simple as blenders and washing machines, and things as complex as water pumps and electricity generators. The coolest thing about them is that they&#8217;re completely human powered.” Rodriguez would then take the skills she learned making bicimaquinas at Mayapedal and teach them to others. “I have contacts in Nicaragua and India, so I&#8217;d work with the proprietors of welding shops/bike shops to create programs where anyone who wanted to learn how to make a bicimaquina could.” She plans to continue this process regardless of having not received the fellowship. “Teaching people how to make bicimaquinas provides an elegant answer to questions of ‘third world’ development, and does it in a way that&#8217;s environmentally friendly.”
