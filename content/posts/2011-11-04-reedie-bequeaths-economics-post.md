The search for a new tenure-track professor of economics has commenced after Lester Lave ’60, who majored in economics at Reed, passed away last May, leaving nearly $3 million to establish the position and improve the economics department.

Economics professor Noelwah Netusil, who is chair of the search committee for the new professor, sent an email to all economics majors stating that the search committee has “the goal of attracting someone who can fill important gaps in our curriculum.” She said that these gaps include health, education, and welfare economics; history of economic thought; and industrial organization, among others.

Economics major Thomas Verghese ’12 hoped that students would be involved in the search process but was unsure of whether that would happen. “It’s actually rather unfortunate that people don’t seem to be interested in job talks [and] treat them as free lectures,” he wrote in an email.

Verghese also questioned whether the position would be attractive to potential candidates. He said that the last round of hiring for the Economics Department was drawn out as candidates kept rejecting job offers because the salary was too low. “If they&#8217;re still following the equal pay doctrine, then there&#8217;s no reason to believe this round of hiring will be more successful than the other attempts,” he said.

The equal pay doctrine specifies that all Reed professors be paid equally based on tenure, in order that no academic field be valued over another. This has been an issue for the Reed Economics Department in particular, because economics professors nationally are paid more than professors in other disciplines.

The professorship comes with a hefty price tag: $2.5 million of Lave’s pension will go directly toward establishing the position. Five percent, or $125,000, will be spent every year on salary and the other costs of professorship. This may be supplemented with general Reed funds. The remainder of the endowment—about $300,000—is designated as general funds for the Economics Department. The exact salary of the position was unclear.

The selected professor will be the seventh tenure-track economics professor at Reed. Currently, at least one of the six tenure-track professors can be on sabbatical at any given time.

The new professor, however, would do more than pad the Economics department. A new professor “would add a great deal of variety to the economics courses on offer,” said Verghese. The professorship may also be necessary in the face of growing numbers of economics majors nationally.

According to President Colin Diver, Lave bequeathed the money in the form of one of his pension funds with the sole intent to strengthen Reed’s economics program. “He had no intention whatsoever of supporting anything else,” said Diver. “He was concerned that the economics program at Reed was not as strong as it needed to be.”

This concern led Lave and Diver to start planning nearly a decade ago on how to use the money Lave would bestow on Reed. Lave decided the funds would best be used to establish an entirely new economics position that could attract top-tier candidates.

Lave himself was an environmental economist and professor at Carnegie Mellon University, where he served as the founding director of the Green Design Institute. He graduated from Reed in 1960 along with his older brother, Charles Lave, who also majored in economics. Lave has since come back to Reed to lecture on his multiple areas of expertise, which included electricity restructuring, climate change, air pollution, and dam safety. He published more than 70 papers and 25 books before his death from cancer last May.  He was 71.
