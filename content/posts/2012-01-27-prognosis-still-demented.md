    Dr. Demento had his start at KRRC.
  </p>
</div>

This past weekend Reed College received an annual visit from the Doctor. Barry Hansen &#8217;63, widely known as Dr. Demento, has shared his rich reservoirs of music and comedy with students, professors, and Portlanders during each Paideia since 1973. Attendees can always count on experiencing a rare line-up of offbeat songs.

Hansen has earned himself an eccentric reputation as a national radio broadcaster since he began his career as a DJ for the KRRC radio station radio station at Reed in the early 60&#8217;s. With a keen eye for unique, often humorous music, Hansen has brought Americans in touch with fantastically quirky novelty songs and brilliant comedic musicians such as Weird Al Yankovic.

But before &#8220;getting demented&#8221; Hansen was another Reed freshman struggling through Hum 110. His story begins long before the illustrious days of nation-wide broadcasts, interviews with Frank Zappa, and appearances on The Simpsons.

While attending high school in Minnesota which he dubbed &#8220;a kind of magnet for brainiacs,&#8221; Hansen met recruiters from Harvard, Yale, Brown, Chicago, Oberlin and Carleton. Then a guy from Reed came along. &#8220;I just liked what the Reed guy had to say&#8221;, stated Hansen, who left an impression on the recruiter. Hansen said, &#8220;It so happened that when the Reed Man came I had a beard. There I was in Minnesota in 1959 with a beard, a senior in high school. It wasn&#8217;t that common.&#8221; Hansen explained that his beard was a remnant from his senior class production of _Playboy of the Western World_ by John Millington Synge. Hansen recalled &#8220;Later, when I showed up as a freshman here, I ran into that same recruiter and he said &#8216;Oh, you&#8217;re the guy with that beard in Minnesota. You looked more like a&#8230;Reedite, which was the word at the time&#8230;than anyone else I saw on that whole tour in the Midwest.&#8217; I don&#8217;t know if that helped me get in or not.&#8221;

Besides the beard Hansen distinguished himself at an early age as a record collector and disc jockey. &#8220;I was especially fascinated with [my family&#8217;s] record player,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so eventually I got my own record player and started picking up records at the local thrift stores or wherever I could get them.&#8221; Thus began a life-long hobby of record collecting.

Entertaining peers with music as a high school student was an enjoyable experience for Hansen. &#8220;All through high school,&#8221; he recalled, &#8220;I was the guy with the records. I was the guy who played the music for the sock hops. I had the biggest collection in school and if I had any status at all it was for that. I mean, I was a little bit of a nerd and not really terribly socially adept, but they knew if they invited Barry to a party they&#8217;d have good music to dance to.&#8221;

Hansen carried his DJ skills over to Portland where he was given a spot on Reed&#8217;s own KRRC, a show he called Blues Unlimited. Hansen said, &#8220;They said, &#8216;Would you like to do a show?&#8217;, and I said well I know something about blues, so they gave me half an hour on Friday nights to play blues.&#8221; When they discovered that he showed up every week and that he worked conscientiously, he received more and more airtime. &#8220;So by the end of the first year,&#8221; Hansen explained, &#8220;it was _Folk Music_ Unlimited and it was three hours. My airtime kept expanding, and so eventually they made me the student station manager simply because I was more into it than anyone else on the staff.&#8221;

During Hansen&#8217;s tenure, KRRC transitioned from a mostly classical station to one which broadcasted a more eclectic variety of genres. The reason, he explained, was that &#8220;The pop music scene was changing. So it wasn&#8217;t so much that it switched over to popular music on my watch or even rock and roll, it was more folk music and jazz, things that the students liked. We found students who had substantial collections of jazz LPs and the same with folk music, and we continued to play classical music, too.&#8221;

    Dr. Demento says hello to Reedies and community members at "Dr. Demento's Greatest Hits"

Hansen began exploring folk music during his years at Reed. He reflected, &#8220;There was a fairly lively folk scene in Portland so I started going to the live performances at a club called the Thirteenth Avenue Gallery&#8230;over in Sellwood. And they had live local folk singers and coffee or cokes, so I went to shows over there.&#8221;

After graduating from Reed, Hansen earned a masters degree at UCLA in folk studies alongside the legendary John Fahey, whose masterful compositions Hansen had begun to listen to as a Reedite. Hansen reminisced about driving up the coast with Fahey to visit Reed in the late 60&#8217;s. Fahey held a concert in the Student Union. Hansen recalled &#8220;That was the first time I visited Reed since I&#8217;d graduated. So it was interesting to come back.&#8221; Fahey was among the first of many musical kinships that Hansen formed throughout his illustrious career.

The Doctor brings this and other valuable experiences to Paideia each year in his scintillating musical lectures. For Paideia &#8217;12, Hansen gave three lectures: He presented &#8220;Here, There, and Everywhere: Where the Beatlesâ€™ Music Came From&#8221; on Thursday night; on Friday he explored the historical as well as the topical with &#8220;A Century of Protest Songs: What Occupy USA Needs is a Hit Song&#8221;; he concluded on Saturday with &#8220;Dr. Demento&#8217;s Greatest Hits,&#8221; which had the audience in stitches.

Hansen says that he is proud to be a Reed alumnus; he returns each year for Paideia and for reunions. Open to meeting current students, Hansen explained, &#8220;Each time I come here for my Paideia I&#8217;ll get to know a few people well enough to be Facebook friends.&#8221; Hansen reminds today&#8217;s Reedies to &#8220;stay Deeeemented&#8221; by embracing the eclectic, original, and zany of music and comedy.
