This week, we lost one of the most well-known and well-petted dogs on campus. Professor Lena Lencek’s poodle Dylan was tragically taken from us last Sunday. Dylan was a member of the community just like any of us, and has probably been around campus for longer than all of us students (and many professors as well). That is to say, Dylan will be missed. Although nearly all of us have met Dylan at one point or another, perhaps the words of someone closer to Dylan can best sum up this feeling of loss. Here is the letter that Bianca Bosker wrote to her mother, Lena Lencek, in memory of Dylan. Please keep Lena in your thoughts._

Dear Mama,

I remember when I first made Dylan&#8217;s acquaintance; the shy, skittish dog you’d adopted took me aback. All our other dogs had been such outsized personalities &#8212; Larry, from what I remember of him, the judgmental glutton; Eddie the freak; Pika I, the tyrant; Pika II, the unapologetic flirt. But here was this little black speck of a dog, with fur so dark and curly bangs so thick you could barely make out his eyes &#8212; save their wet glint &#8212; cowering behind your legs and running away from all &#8220;hellos.&#8221; He seemed to be hiding behind his fur, when not cowering behind a table leg. I&#8217;m not sure how this pairing is going to work, I remember thinking skeptically to myself. How will this introverted, trembling little thing manage socializing with all Mama&#8217;s students? Or the flights? Or getting ferried around from house to house and coast to coast? I thought he&#8217;d go nuts from all the stimulation and strangers.

But then bit by bit, every time I saw him, Dylan had transformed a little, to the point that, by the time I saw him last, he was unrecognizable as the spooked little dog I first met. At every visit, he seemed surer of himself and more comfortable with the world. He fell in love with the world, under your watch. He&#8217;d perceptibly matured, grown more confidant, come into his own. He became downright bold. But what I loved about him (second) best is that even with his new confidence, he never stopped consulting you. You were his first priority. Before every bound ahead toward a new smell or new creature, he&#8217;d pause to look up at you and check in with you. &#8220;Is this okay? Do you mind if I go here now? Will you be okay if I check this out?&#8221; You made him so happy &#8212; you turned him into a happy animal &#8212; and he wanted nothing more than to make you happy. And that he succeeded in doing, which is what I loved about him best.

I say this not to make the pain worse, and I hope it doesn&#8217;t, but just to remember how you changed his life, even as he did yours and ours. Your love turned this shadow of a dog into a member of the family with a huge heart and celebratory spirit who brought us so much joy and humor and companionship. I&#8217;ve loved all our pets, but I can&#8217;t help but think that Dylan was the most civilized of them all. He was loving, but not indiscriminately so &#8212; He reserved his affection for certain people, who had earned it, and those who had, he showered with his superb company. He was never a silly dog, even though he loved to cut loose, racing around the sand, and I could tell he never lost his appreciation for all that you did for him and showed him. You might have spoiled him, but he certainly wasn&#8217;t spoiled. I got the sense he treasured every day he had with you and never thought to waste it with trivial things.

I will miss him so very much. I&#8217;m so sad for him and even more for you because I know what a dear companion he was. I loved every minute I got to spend with him, and he was a wonderful member of the family. I thank him for giving us so much, and I know that he would have thanked you for giving so much to him.
