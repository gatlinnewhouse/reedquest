_**By Austin Weisgrau**_

I left the Reed Union on climate change feeling about as frustrated as I usually feel when I engage with _Reed_ as a thing. The event was advertised as &#8220;a forum for important issues of relevance to the Reed community,&#8221; which meant to me that we would be acknowledging and discussing our role in the &#8220;important issue,&#8221; our culpabilities and responsibilities.

The event was, however, thoroughly academic. Our professors gave short lectures in their Ô¨Åelds of expertise, and seemed generally unwilling to otherwise engage the topic. I&#8217;m pissed off because the only response to my question of our agency as an institution was given by Ed McFarlane, our vice president and treasurer, who indicated that Reed has historically been unwilling to GAF and will likely continue as such now and in the future.

My take-away is another layer of distaste for our collective hypocrisy in refusing to recognize and remediate our own participation in destructive systems. If we eat meat, if we invest in fossil fuels, I believe we are complicit and culpable. Embrace your moral agency, Reed!
