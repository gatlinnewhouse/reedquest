Since its debut in 1995, the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show has been an annual event drawing millions of viewers each year. Featuring the infamous models of the lingerie and sleepwear conglomerate strutting down the runway in fantastical undergarments, the controversial show has been attacked by media critics, parents organizations, and women&#8217;s groups as both a glamorized exercise in infomericialism and thinly-disguised softcore pornography. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped 8.3 million people from watching the show in 2009, or from drawing a crowd about the same size this year as well. And the effect of the show is stronger than ever. While perusing blogs on the night of the show, I was shocked to discover an alarming amount of responses to the lavish extravaganza:

&#8220;I&#8217;m watching the VS Fashion Show. I seriously want to throw up everything I ate, run a million laps, and do a kajillion crunches.&#8221;

&#8220;Immediate repercussions of the Victoria&#8217;s Secret Fashion Show: eating nothing but salad until next Tuesday.&#8221;

&#8220;Tomorrow. I&#8217;m fasting.”

&#8220;Tis the season to be skinny, fa la la la la&#8230;&#8221;

While some of these bloggers are your run-of-the-mill, attention-hungry adolescent girls, the majority of them identify their online journals as &#8220;thinspirational&#8221; (or &#8220;thinspo&#8221;) blogs. For those of you unfamiliar with this internet phenomenon, thinspo blogs are online logs primarily created by young girls who aim to lose weight by chronicling their progress towards a weight goal, usually posting hundreds of &#8220;thinspirational&#8221; images: wispy models, pictures of &#8220;ideal&#8221; body parts (thighs, stomachs, buttocks, etc.), and quotes that supposedly encourage them. Said quotes are along the lines of the following:

&#8220;A moment on the lips, forever on the hips&#8230;and stomach, and arms, and thighs.&#8221;

&#8220;When your skinny friends tell you you&#8217;re not fat and tell you not to diet, they&#8217;re lying. They just don&#8217;t want you to be skinnier.&#8221;

&#8220;The answer to a new, slimmer you is right beneath your nose. So stop shoveling food into your mouth, you greedy fuck.”

&#8220;If you eat again, you can never be like her.&#8221;

To some of you, this sort of behavior may seem completely abnormal and perverse. As for myself, I cringed inwardly to realize that nothing has really changed in the world of female adolescence since I was fifteen&#8230; and maybe things are a little bit worse. With immediate access to an ever-expanding universe of possibilities, young girls can easily be bombarded by overwhelming amounts of images projecting the “ideal” body. Though they’ve been said time and time again, words of encouragement instructing females to “embrace your curves!” or “love yourself the way you are!” are simply not getting through to these young women who have been convinced by society that they have fallen so far short of perfection they are not worth loving.

As a teenager, I was no stranger to this warped world of unhealthy self-image. I witnessed firsthand the downward spiral of eating disorders–the tears, the anger, the despair–and was even prey myself to the infectious mentality that I wasn’t “good enough.” It takes years to fully recover from the crippling effect that negative body image has on an individual.

Is there any solution to the problem? Who knows. We have built a culture around dissecting the human body mercilessly in the pursuit of ultimate perfection, and the cost is enormous. Generations of girls and boys are growing up feeling physically inadequate, turning to muscle enhancing products, cosmetic surgery, and other means of plucking, pinching, tucking, painting, augmenting, and tweezing themselves to perfection.

That’s why this week I’m imploring all of you to do each other a favor: tell someone you know, or someone you don’t know, that they’re beautiful. Sometimes that’s all it takes. You never know who needs it most.
