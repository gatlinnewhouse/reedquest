Reed&#8217;s first annual Working Weekend came to Vollum last weekend, bringing career advice and connections to a campus often criticized for its focus on impractical lofty ideals. Alumni traveled from as far as France to share their post-graduate experiences and advice with current Reedies. Though many students were aware of the event, turnout was fairly low, though impressions among those who did attend were high.

The event was comprised of two significant parts. One part was the Start-Up lab, an entrepreneurial competition/partnership for interested students. For those who weren&#8217;t interested in participating in the Start-Up Lab, there were various panels held by alumni. The panels covered a wide variety of topics, from &#8216;green&#8217; technology, to careers in government, to food, to non-profit management. Alumni who had somehow distinguished themselves within their fields spoke at these panels and provided invaluable insight and tips that only Reed alumni could give. Though panels were widely varying in the subject matter and often specialized to a certain degree, there was an overarching message that seemed to permeate all parts of the event. Most alumni&#8217;s stories described a very circuitous path leading to an occupation that is both fulfilling and able to keep you sustained. Though many Reedies do not yet know what they want to do, many were comforted to hear stories of success from others who have gone through the Reed experience – from Renn Fayre, to Paideia, to Humanities 101, to Thesis. Freshman Austin Weisgrau stated, “It’s reassuring to know what a Reed education really does for you.”

Statements like &#8220;Reedies will always be able to find a job,&#8221; as said by alumni Pam Kingpetcharat (&#8217;95), current Chief Administrative Officer for Human Rights First, a nonprofit nonpartisan human rights organization, addressed the issue very directly. Other alumni approached it in a more roundabout way, saying things to the effect of “at Reed, you learn to learn.” What such a phrase really means is that Reedies will always be able to adapt and change—Forest Atkinson (&#8217;96) comes to mind: He was a Physics major during his time at Reed but now works for the United States Department of State as a Foreign Service Officer. He had no idea he would end up doing such a thing but through many seemingly random steps that all began with his time in the Peace Corps, found himself working for the U.S. government and loving it.

Even those who did not take advantage of Working Weekend should remember that alumni are not to be taken for granted. They&#8217;re eager to correspond with students through email to discuss internships, strategies, or any relevant career information. And finally, Working Weekend will recur next year, giving Reedies another chance to prepare for the world outside the bubble.
