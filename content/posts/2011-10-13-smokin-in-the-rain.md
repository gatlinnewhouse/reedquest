Senate has put in a proposal to the Community Affairs Committee for the building of a covered smoking structure. Rain is an obvious problem for smokers, and a survey taken last year indicated that 70% of students felt that “there were not adequate covered spaces on campus for smokers,” sparking the new plan. The covered area in question would be constructed between the ETC and the library, and would likely be permanent or semi-permanent. The plan is to create an aesthetically pleasing pavilion that allows smokers a place to go that is out of the rain and not right in front of a public thoroughfare. According to Reed Senator Aidan Sigman, the plans are still in the works and have to go through C.A.C. before the details are established.
  
This proposal came from a dichotomy of opinion about smoking on campus. At Reed, almost 25% of students smoke, but 40% of students said that they are bothered by others smoking. Sigman noted, “there were people who were very angry that there was smoking on campus” and others who “didn’t realize that it was a problem.”
  
It may appear that the creation of a smoking structure would be catering to avid non-smokers by sending the smokers away from places like the library breezeway. It could be seen as a stepping stone to eliminating smoking on campus entirely. Instead, the idea being proposed is not that smokers be restricted to the covered areas, but rather that they have the option of choosing the structures rather than public areas.
  
The student body is generally in favor of creating more covered spaces for smokers. Over 60% of those surveyed favor using student body funds to pay for the structures. But until the structure is actually built, the conflict remains relevant in the community. Students do not agree whether it is the smoker’s responsibility to ask permission to smoke or the nearby students’ to speak up.
  
A former smoker on campus says that the smoke doesn’t bother her, but that in her opinion smoking in public areas “is generally not honorable.”  She continued, “I think that people who smoke are generally not very aware of how they affect other people, and they don’t really care&#8230;. I don’t think there is a very clear solution.”
  
Meanwhile, chain-smoker Marcus Rose ‘14 remarked that “as long as they don’t obtrusively blow second-hand smoke in non-smokers’ faces, I don’t think anyone has a right to socially engineer where people smoke.” However, not everyone agrees with Rose’s view. In the survey data, Senate marked that they believe the smoking shelter represents a “mutually acceptable middle ground” that is an attempt to “accommodate the wishes of both groups.”
  
Other colleges deal with the smokers that arrive on campus in a variety of ways. Lewis and Clark, for instance, has designated smoking structures all over campus, and smoking is prohibited except for in those areas. Whether Reed will eventually adopt this policy is unknown. The hope is that with the construction of the smoking shelter, fewer people will be bothered by smoke in public spaces and smokers can feel comfortable smoking somewhere dry without being hassled or feeling obnoxious. Discussion will continue as Reed tries to satisfy both groups. “In my ideal world, people would just work it out,” says Sigman.  “It was something people wanted,” Sigman said.
