  Buried deep in the foundations of Bragdon, lay memories of Olde Reed. From 1958 to 1997, two men’s dorms occupied the space where Bragdon now stands: Ackerman and Sisson.

When these Cross Canyon dorms were first built, along with Chittick, Woodbridge, and McKinley, they were all the rage. The architectural firm of 1940 Reed alum, Mr. Farnham, and his associates, Mr. Shell and Mr. Hoyt, was used. According to Director of Facilities Services, Townsend Angell, they used Tectum insulation (heating that was considered great in the 60s, but below par today). They also were made up of undivided doubles and triples that contained built-in, unmovable bunk beds.

In an article from Dec. 1957 in _The Sallyport_, a Reed alumni magazine, the vision behind these new dorms is laid out: “Neither the barracks type of the large university, nor the fraternity house idea was satisfactory. A new building had to be designed that would be appropriate to the unique educational program of Reed College and be capable of construction within a limited budget.”

The article also explains that the dorms were, “facetiously dubbed by the students the ‘New, New Men’s Dorm’ (so called because the naming of the present new men’s dorm awaits the completion of these new buildings)…”

“It was a kind of architecture that was really groovy in its day,” Angell says.

Despite the popularity of the dorms among students, they were made in poor fashion. According to Angell, the rumor goes that when President Koblick called Farnham to say he was tearing them down, the architect replied, “Good.”

When it came time to provide more on-campus housing for students, Ackerman and Sisson were torn down. These Olde dorms were lost to history and replaced by Bragdon, which provides 65 rooms, compared to a total of 50 rooms between Ackerman and Sisson.

Bragdon’s namesake is a nod to the olde, as it was named after Reed’s president from 1971 to 1988: Paul Bragdon.

<span style="text-align: center;">President Koblik once said, “Nancy and Paul Bragdon have had Reed students living in their home for many years. This tradition continues to this day. Added up, all the students who have stayed in their home would probably fill a residence hall.”</span>
