It has been a long and trying semester. We have all grown sick and weary of stalking to the library armed with only a mug of coffee and the dim prospect of returning home triumphant.

Because I know that when I get home my mother will be waiting for me with a plate of cookies and a warm hug, congratulating me on a job well done.
  
And even though I know that in a few weeks I will have a serious case of cabin fever, it will leave me well-rested and ready to return to the endless hamster wheel of work that is Reed College.

In years past I have watched multiple seasons of scifi television shows, engaged in week-long sessions of watching Lord of the Rings. I have spent entire days indulging in fatty, cheesy foods on my couch, and I am proud.

I’m really excited to hang out with my siblings, catch up with all of my friends from home and hit up all of my favorite spots.

When I go on break I just want to vegetate like a motherfucker, to kick it with my homies and do stupid things all of January. I’ll be goddamn intellectual when I graduate.

We spend so much of our postulating grand theoretical claims that we forget there is value to life lived without intellectual masturbation. Seriously, how many of you have gone for a hike or realized that you live in a physical world full of natural beauty?

You are not a brain in a vat. Just as the hermit crab, whose shell has been worn thin, you must emerge from the darkness and find yourself new perspective and a true appreciation for the fine art of living.
