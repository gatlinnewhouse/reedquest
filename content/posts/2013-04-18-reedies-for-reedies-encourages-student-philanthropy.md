With expectations of raising between $8,000 and $10,000 this year, scholarship fund Reedies for Reedies says that financial goals are not the committee’s priority, encouraging philanthropy at Reed College is.

Reedies for Reedies replaced the Class of 2010 Scholarship in spring 2010 and stresses, according to their mission statement, that “In recognition of the value of a Reed education, current Reed students will provide support to an entering student with financial need by harnessing the power of many to make a difference for one.” Originally asking for donations from current seniors, the committee later expanded to all students, according to the Reed College Magazine.

For the first year of the committee’s existence, former President Colin Diver matched all student donations, which resulted in a total of $11,707 from the donations of 212 students. Now, alumni complement student donations. These alumni include Venky Ganesan ’96, who contributed to a total of $10,905 in 2011, and Bob Smith ’57, who has agreed to match donations this year up to $2,500 and donate an additional $2,500 if 350 students participate.

“This year, we are hoping to receive a total of around $8,000-$10,000,” Jacob Cantor ’14 says. “While we do believe that our contribution to a students financial aid package is significant, we have a greater goal in mind.

“Namely, we want to talk with students about the benefits of donating to Reed College. We want to encourage more philanthropy at Reed because we believe it fits harmoniously within the Reed ethos: an appreciation for the contributions others have given you, a sensitivity to the support others may need, an acknowledgment of the impact one&#8217;s behavior can have on the community.”

For Cantor, being in a position of asking for money is a vulnerable one, making it sometimes difficult to reach out to people for donations.

“In general, I would say that the donations I have received from individuals have been given with thought and an appreciation for the effort being made,” Cantor says. “However, that does not mean I think we have received enough donations yet to frankly say that we have been successful. To be blunt, we need to solicit for donations more often and reach out to more people.” Cantor says Reedies for Reedies plans to spend more time in the library lobby and commons, put on an event outside the line for Hum Play, and hand out T-shirts at the end of the year in an effort to solicit more donations.

Says Cantor, “Yes, we are asking for your money, and that matters. But it is not what matters most. Rather, we are looking for donations that are made because the individual believed our cause was worthwhile and wanted to do something to help.”
